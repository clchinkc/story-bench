  content: |
    The underground market of Vel'kara stretched for miles beneath the desert, a labyrinth
    of torch-lit tunnels and impossible bazaars where anything could be bought if you knew
    the right words. Zara adjusted her hood as she pushed through the crowd, the stolen
    map crackling against her chest inside her vest.

    Three days in this lawless place, and she'd already made enemies. The Scorpion Guild
    didn't appreciate thieves who stole from thieves. But she'd also made an unexpected
    ally: Tomás, a disgraced scholar who claimed to know the route to the Sunken Library
    she sought—a repository of forbidden knowledge that might hold the cure for her
    mother's wasting sickness.

    "We need to move," Tomás said, appearing at her elbow. His eyes darted to the shadows
    where figures in scorpion-marked cloaks were gathering. "They've found us."

    Zara's hand went to the knife at her belt. She'd grown up in the slums of the capital,
    learned to fight before she learned to read. But the Scorpion Guild had numbers.

    "This way." Tomás grabbed her arm. "There's a passage they don't know about. It'll
    take us into the Approach—the Ordeal before the Library."

    As they ran, Zara wondered if she was ready for what came next.
