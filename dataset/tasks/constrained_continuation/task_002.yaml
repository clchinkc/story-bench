    "And that," Priya announced, "is why we're going to win the Austin Food Truck
    Championship."

    Her business partner Dev stared at the chaos before them: a converted school bus
    painted electric pink, a menu that somehow combined her grandmother's Punjabi
    recipes with Texas barbecue, and a grand total of zero customers on their opening
    day.

    "We've been open for four hours," he said. "The only person who bought anything
    was your cousin, and he asked for a refund."

    "He's lactose intolerant. That's on him for ordering paneer tacos."

    "They're ALL paneer tacos, Priya. That's our whole thing."

    Despite the disastrous start, Priya felt alive in a way she hadn't since quitting
    her soul-crushing corporate job. Three weeks of late nights, permit nightmares,
    and Dev threatening to back out had led to this moment: their dream, such as it was,
    parked in an empty lot in East Austin.

    A notification buzzed on her phone. A local food blogger with 200,000 followers had
    just posted a photo of their truck with the caption: "What's this disaster parked
    on Cesar Chavez?"

    Dev groaned. Priya grinned.

    "Any publicity is good publicity," she said. "Come on. Let's go save our dream."
