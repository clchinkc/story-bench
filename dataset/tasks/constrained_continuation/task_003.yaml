    The space elevator carried Jin upward through Earth's atmosphere, past the terminator
    line where day dissolved into night. Through the reinforced window, the planet shrank
    from a world to a marble—beautiful, fragile, and now forbidden to him.

    Twenty-three years old and already an exile.

    The warrant had been issued that morning: treason against the Global Sustainability
    Council. His crime? Leaking proof that the Council was deliberately suppressing a
    breakthrough in carbon capture technology—technology that could have reversed climate
    collapse but would have disrupted too many powerful interests.

    Now Earth's governments had closed ranks. Every nation on the surface wanted him
    silenced. His only hope was the Free Orbital Collective, a loose confederation of
    space stations that had declared independence from terrestrial law three years ago.

    They didn't extradite. That was their one rule.

    But as the elevator climbed toward his new home among the stars, Jin couldn't shake
    the weight of what he'd left behind. His parents, who would face questioning. His
    research partner Yuna, who had helped him leak the documents. The hope that he could
    still make a difference.

    The elevator shuddered as it locked into the orbital ring.

    "Welcome to the Collective," a voice announced. "Please proceed to processing."

    A new world. A new fight. A completely unfamiliar situation.
