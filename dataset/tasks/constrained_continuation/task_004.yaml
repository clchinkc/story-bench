    London, 1888.

    Eleanor Blackwood stood at her father's grave as the last mourners departed, their
    black umbrellas receding into the November fog like a murder of crows. The solicitor
    had delivered the news that morning: the printing house was hers now. Along with its
    debts.

    "Miss Blackwood?" Her father's assistant, Mr. Thomas Chen, approached with hesitant
    steps. The only son of Chinese immigrants, he had worked at Blackwood & Sons for
    a decade and knew its operations better than anyone. "The creditors are calling.
    They want a meeting."

    "How long do we have?"

    "Three months, perhaps. If we're fortunate."

    Eleanor had spent twenty-six years being told that business was not a woman's
    domain. Her father had loved her, but he'd trained her brother William for succession—
    William, who had emigrated to America five years ago and shown no interest in returning.

    The printing house was all she had left of her father. And it was dying.

    "There's something else," Thomas said. He pulled a manuscript from his coat—dog-eared
    pages covered in handwritten text. "Your father was working on this before he passed.
    A serialized novel, written under a pseudonym. He believed it could save the company."

    Eleanor took the pages. The title read: "The Whitechapel Murders: A True Account."

    Her blood ran cold. Everyone in London knew what was happening in Whitechapel.
    The Ripper was still hunting.
