    Dr. Yuki Tanaka, a xenolinguist who has spent 15 years studying

    The year 2157. Earth has just received its first confirmed alien
    signal. Yuki is called to a secret facility in Antarctica to lead

    translating it will require Yuki to face the very human connections
    she's avoided her entire life.
