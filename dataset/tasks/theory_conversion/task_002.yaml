    1. YOU (COMFORT ZONE):
    Maya taught pottery in her small coastal village, content with her quiet life. Her
    pieces were simple—functional bowls and cups that villagers used daily. She never
    attempted the elaborate ceremonial vessels her late grandmother had been famous for.

    2. NEED:
    But something was missing. At night, she dreamed of fire and clay, of shapes her
    hands had never made. The village's sacred spring had run dry, and the elders said
    only a ceremonial vessel—a true master's work—could call the water back.

    3. GO (ENTER UNFAMILIAR):
    The mountain shrine where her grandmother had learned the old ways was a three-day
    journey. Maya went, though she'd never traveled alone, never climbed higher than
    the village hills.

    4. SEARCH:
    The shrine was ruins, the masters long dead. But among the rubble, Maya found her
    grandmother's journal, filled with techniques she'd never taught anyone. The secret
    wasn't skill—it was surrender. "Let the clay speak," the final entry read. "Your
    hands are not the sculptor."

    5. FIND:
    Alone in the ruined shrine, Maya built a fire and worked through the night. For
    the first time, she stopped trying to control the clay. The vessel that emerged
    was nothing like her grandmother's work—it was something entirely new. Hers.

    6. TAKE:
    She took the vessel, knowing she was also taking responsibility. To bring it back
    meant accepting that she was no longer just Maya the potter. She was a keeper of
    the old ways, whether she felt ready or not.

    7. RETURN:
    The journey home was harder, the vessel heavy with meaning. Twice she considered
    abandoning it, returning to her comfortable anonymity.

    8. CHANGE:
    But she brought it home. And when she placed it at the spring and poured her
    intentions into the ceremony, the water returned—not because of the vessel's
    perfection, but because Maya had finally become who she was meant to be.
