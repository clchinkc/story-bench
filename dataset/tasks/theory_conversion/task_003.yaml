    OPENING IMAGE: Kenji Nakamura, 52, stands alone in his pristine corner office,
    watching Tokyo's skyline through rain-streaked glass. His desk is empty—cleared
    out. His nameplate already removed.

    THEME STATED: "Sometimes losing everything is how we find what matters," his
    secretary says, handing him a cardboard box.

    SET-UP: Twenty years building this company from nothing. A wife who left when he
    chose work over family. A daughter who sends birthday cards with no return address.
    And now, a hostile takeover that leaves him with nothing but his reputation and a
    severance package.

    CATALYST: A letter from his estranged daughter, Yuki, arrives. She's getting
    married—in a small village in Kyoto where she's been living. She wants him to
    walk her down the aisle. "I know we don't talk. But Mom's gone now, and I don't
    want to do this alone."

    DEBATE: Should he go? He barely knows her anymore. What right does he have to
    play father now? But the company is gone. His apartment feels like a museum.
    There's nothing keeping him in Tokyo anymore.

    BREAK INTO TWO: Kenji takes the train to Kyoto.

    B STORY: In the village, he meets Haruki, an elderly craftsman who makes traditional
    bamboo crafts. Haruki becomes an unlikely friend, showing Kenji a way of life
    measured in generations, not quarterly reports.

    FUN AND GAMES: Kenji awkwardly tries to reconnect with Yuki. He helps with wedding
    preparations—badly. He learns to weave bamboo. He sleeps better than he has in years.

    MIDPOINT: At a festival, Yuki introduces him to her fiancé's family. For the first
    time, Kenji sees his daughter as an adult—capable, loved, complete without him.
    False victory: he thinks he can just slip back into her life.

    BAD GUYS CLOSE IN: Old business rivals track him down, offering to back him in a
    new venture. The temptation of his old life. Meanwhile, Yuki finds out he's been
    offered the deal and thinks he only came to use the wedding as networking.

    ALL IS LOST: Yuki confronts him: "You haven't changed. You're still choosing
    ambition over people." She uninvites him from the wedding.

    DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL: Kenji sits alone in the inn, realizing Yuki is right.
    Every choice he's made has led here—alone, unwanted, unable to fix what he's broken.

    BREAK INTO THREE: Kenji calls the investors. Declines the deal. Then he goes to
    find Yuki—not to change her mind, but to apologize without conditions.

    FINALE: He doesn't attend the wedding, but he's there—outside the venue, watching
    from afar. Afterward, Yuki finds him. "You stayed." "You're my daughter. I should
    have stayed years ago." They don't reconcile completely, but they begin.

    FINAL IMAGE: Kenji, back in Tokyo, has opened a small bamboo craft shop. His
    apartment is no longer a museum—there are plants, handmade bowls, a photo of
    Yuki on the shelf. He's alone, but no longer empty.
