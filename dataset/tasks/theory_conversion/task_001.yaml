    ACT ONE:

    Dr. Samira Hassan had spent fifteen years building her reputation as a virologist.
    Now, staring at the anomalous protein structure on her screen, she realized everything
    she knew might be wrong. The sample from Patient Zero showed something impossible—a
    virus that shouldn't exist, couldn't exist according to every model she'd studied.

    Her assistant Raj appeared at the door. "The CDC is on line two. They want to know
    why we requested an emergency containment team."

    "Tell them—" She paused. If she was wrong, her career was over. If she was right,
    they were all in danger. "Tell them we have a potential Level 4 outbreak."

    ACT TWO:

    The next seventy-two hours blurred together. The containment team arrived. The hospital
    was quarantined. And more patients kept showing up with the same impossible symptoms.
    Samira worked without sleep, racing against a pathogen that seemed to evolve faster
    than she could study it.

    "We're missing something," she told Raj at hour sixty, surrounded by failed test
    results. "It's not mutating randomly. It's adapting. Like it's designed to."

    The realization hit like ice water. She pulled up Patient Zero's file again, looking
    for what she'd missed. The employer field: Nexus Biotech. A company that had been
    quietly buying up gene-editing patents for years.

    "Oh god," she whispered. "It's not natural. Someone made this."

    ACT THREE:

    The confrontation with Nexus came at the worst possible moment—twelve hours before
    the quarantine was set to fail. Samira had the proof, but Nexus had lawyers, PR teams,
    and a senator on speed dial. They were going to bury her along with the truth.

    Unless she went public first.

    The press conference was chaos. Accusations, denials, Nexus threatening lawsuits in
    real-time. But Samira had one card left to play: the formula for the cure, developed
    in those sleepless hours, shared simultaneously with every major news outlet and
    medical journal in the world.

    "You can sue me into oblivion," she said into the cameras, "but you can't patent
    something that belongs to everyone."

    Six weeks later, the outbreak was contained. Nexus was under federal investigation.
    And Dr. Samira Hassan was unemployable at any major institution—but alive, and at
    peace with her choices.
