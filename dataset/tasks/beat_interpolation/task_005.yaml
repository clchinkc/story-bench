    Maya signed the contract with a hand that barely trembled. Six months as personal
    chef to Alejandro Vega—retired soccer legend, notorious recluse, and according to
    every tabloid in existence, the most difficult man in Spain.

    "You understand the terms?" His assistant, a severe woman named Lucia, collected
    the papers. "No photography. No interviews. No contact with press. Breach of
    confidentiality carries a penalty of—"

    "Two million euros. I read it." Maya met Lucia's gaze steadily. "I'm here to cook,
    not to sell stories."

    What she didn't say: she was also here to save her grandmother's restaurant. The
    salary was three times market rate. Enough to clear the debts, repair the kitchen,
    maybe even expand. All she had to do was survive six months with a man who had
    driven away seven previous chefs in two years.

    The car that took her to the estate wound through olive groves and past ancient
    stone walls. And when she finally saw the villa—a sprawling masterpiece of terracotta
    and white stone overlooking the Mediterranean—she allowed herself one moment of pure,
    terrified hope.

    Six months. She could do anything for six months.

    The photograph was everywhere. Every website, every gossip show, every corner of
    the internet: Maya and Alejandro, silhouetted against the sunset on his private
    balcony, his forehead pressed to hers in a moment of unmistakable intimacy.

    "I didn't take it," she said for the hundredth time, standing in his study while
    he stared out the window with his back to her. "I would never—"

    "It doesn't matter who took it." His voice was flat. "You know what they'll say.
    The poor chef seducing the rich recluse. The contract violation alone—"

    "Alejandro, please—"

    "My lawyers will ensure you're not sued. You can keep the salary you've earned."
    He finally turned, and the coldness in his eyes was worse than anger. "But you
    need to leave. Today."

    "And if I don't want to go?"

    "Then I'll have security escort you out." He walked past her toward the door,
    pausing just long enough to say, "I actually believed you were different. That
    was my mistake."

    The door closed with a click of terrible finality.

    Maya stood alone in the study, watching her grandmother's restaurant and everything
    else she'd started to hope for crumble to dust around her.

  name: "Act 2 Midpoint - Point of Commitment"
  position: "between End of Act 1 and End of Act 2"
  definition: "In Three-Act Structure, the Midpoint is a pivotal reversal or revelation that raises stakes and shifts the protagonist from reactive to proactive. It represents a point of no return in their emotional journey—they commit fully, and the relationship/goal becomes about more than the original motivation."

    - "Maya discovers something vulnerable about Alejandro"
    - "Their relationship shifts from professional to personal"

  must_not_include:

    - "Maya deciding to leave or breach the contract"
