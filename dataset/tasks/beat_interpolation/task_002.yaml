  content: |
    The envelope arrived without a postmark, slipped under Detective Sarah Chen's apartment
    door sometime during the night. Inside: a single photograph of her sister Amy, bound
    to a chair in what looked like an abandoned warehouse. A phone number was written on
    the back in red marker.

    Sarah's hands trembled as she dialed. The voice that answered was digitally distorted,
    inhuman. "Detective Chen. I'm impressed—most people stare at the photo for at least
    an hour before they find the courage to call."

    "What do you want?" Her voice was steadier than she felt.

    "Your testimony. The Marchetti trial begins Monday. You're the star witness. I want
    you to recant. Say you were mistaken about seeing Vincent Marchetti pull the trigger."

    "And if I refuse?"

    "Then your sister becomes an example of what happens to those who oppose the Marchetti
    family. You have seventy-two hours to decide, Detective. Choose wisely."

    The line went dead.

beat_after:
  name: "Break Into Two"
  content: |
    Sarah stood outside Captain Morrison's office, her resignation letter in one hand and
    her badge in the other. She'd made her choice. Not the one they expected.

    She wasn't going to recant her testimony. She wasn't going to let Amy die. She was
    going to do both—keep Marchetti behind bars AND save her sister. But she couldn't do
    it as a cop. Too many rules, too much oversight, too many ways for the Marchetti family's
    moles in the department to track her every move.

    The letter slid under the door with a whisper of finality.

    Forty-five minutes later, Sarah Chen—former detective, current vigilante—sat in a
    rented car outside the Marchetti compound, watching the guards patrol the perimeter.
    She had seventy hours left. A laptop full of case files she'd copied before turning
    in her badge. A list of every criminal contact who owed her a favor.

    And absolutely nothing left to lose.
