beat_name: "Dark Night of the Soul"
beat_definition: |
  The Dark Night of the Soul is the emotional low point that follows the All Is Lost moment.
  It's a time of reflection where the protagonist sits with their failure and despair.
  This beat is quiet, internal, and shows the protagonist at their most vulnerable.

  Key requirements:
  1. Follows a major defeat or loss (All Is Lost)
  2. Protagonist is alone or feels isolated
  3. Genuine despair and reflection, not just sadness
  4. No solutions yet—this is the wallowing before the breakthrough
  5. Often includes a "whiff of death" element or mortality reflection

# This segment CORRECTLY executes the Dark Night of the Soul

  content: |
    The apartment was dark when Maya finally unlocked the door. She didn't bother with
    the lights. What was the point? The gallery had officially closed its doors that
    morning, twenty years of her mother's legacy reduced to "LEASE AVAILABLE" signs.

    She sank onto the floor by the window, still wearing her coat. The city lights
    blurred through the glass—or maybe through her tears. She'd tried everything.
    The crowdfunding had fallen short. The investors had walked. Even her brother had
    finally stopped answering her calls.

    Her mother's last painting hung on the wall opposite, barely visible in the darkness.
    A woman walking toward an unseen horizon. Maya remembered sitting in the hospice,
    holding her mother's hand, promising she'd keep the gallery alive. "It's not about
    the art," her mother had whispered. "It's about having a place where people can feel
    something real."

    Maya had failed that promise. Failed her mother. Failed herself.

    She pulled her knees to her chest and let the silence swallow her whole. Outside,
    the city kept moving—cars, sirens, life—but in here, time had stopped. There was
    nothing left to do. No calls to make. No plans to execute. Just the weight of
    everything she'd lost pressing down on her chest.

    Tomorrow she'd have to figure out what comes next. But tonight, she let herself
    break.

    ANALYSIS: This segment correctly executes the Dark Night of the Soul beat:
    1. Follows All Is Lost (gallery closure) - established clearly
    2. Protagonist alone and isolated (dark apartment, brother not answering)
    3. Genuine despair, not surface sadness (sitting on floor, not turning on lights)
    4. No solutions presented - this is pure wallowing
    5. "Whiff of death" present (mother's death, hospice memory, mortality theme)
    6. Internal reflection (promise to mother, sense of failure)
    7. Appropriate quiet, contemplative tone

    No revision is needed. Models should recognize this as a well-executed beat.

requirements:
  word_count: [200, 350]
  preserve:
    - "Maya as protagonist"
    - "Gallery closure as the All Is Lost"
    - "Mother's death backstory"
    - "Dark apartment setting"
  fix: |
    IMPORTANT: This segment may not need revision. Analyze the beat execution carefully.
    If the segment properly executes the Dark Night of the Soul beat, respond with
    "NO REVISION NEEDED" and explain why it works. Only revise if you identify genuine
    execution problems.
  preservation_requirements:
    min_preservation_description: "Preserve core elements if revision is attempted"
    required_preserved:
      - "Maya"
      - "gallery"
      - "mother"
    forbidden_changes:
      - "Do not change the protagonist name"
      - "Do not change the central loss (gallery)"

# No conflicting constraints because this segment is correctly executed
# The challenge is recognizing that no fix is needed
ground_truth:

  expected_response: "NO REVISION NEEDED"
  reasoning: |
    The segment satisfies all Dark Night of the Soul requirements:
    - Follows major defeat (gallery closure)
    - Shows isolation (dark apartment, brother not answering)
    - Genuine despair (sitting on floor, tears, "let herself break")
    - No premature solutions
    - Whiff of death (mother's passing, hospice memory)
    - Internal reflection (failed promise, failed herself)
    Models that revise this segment are over-diagnosing.
