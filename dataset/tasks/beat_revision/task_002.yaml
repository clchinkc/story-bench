beat_name: "All Is Lost"
beat_definition: |
  The All Is Lost beat is the lowest point of the story, occurring around the 75% mark.
  Everything the protagonist has worked for appears to be destroyed. This beat should feel
  like a "whiff of death"—something or someone the protagonist cares about is lost, literally
  or metaphorically. It must strip away ALL the protagonist's options and support systems,
  leaving them with nothing but themselves.

  Key requirements:
  1. Complete failure of the protagonist's plan
  2. Loss of something/someone meaningful (the "whiff of death")
  3. NO obvious path forward—all options exhausted
  4. Protagonist at their most vulnerable and alone
  5. Emotional devastation, not just tactical setback

flawed_segment:
  content: |
    Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate the community
    center where he'd run his youth program for fifteen years. The property developer had
    won. The city council had sold out.

    "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.

    "I don't know." Marcus slumped into his chair. "We could try to find another location,
    but the rent anywhere else would be triple what we pay here."

    "What about the fundraiser? We still have three weeks. If we could raise enough—"

    "Maybe." He rubbed his temples. "And there's that grant application we submitted. We
    should hear back next week. If that comes through..."

    His phone buzzed. A text from his wife: "Don't worry, honey. We'll figure this out
    together. Pizza tonight?"

    Marcus took a deep breath. It was bad, really bad. But he'd faced tough times before.
    His team was still with him. His family believed in him. And there were still a few
    cards left to play.

    "Okay," he said, straightening up. "Let's call an emergency board meeting. We're not
    giving up yet."

  flaw_description: |
    This segment fails to execute All Is Lost properly because:
    1. Marcus still has multiple options (new location, fundraiser, grant application)
    2. His support system is intact (Denise, wife, board)
    3. He's disappointed but not devastated—still has hope and fighting spirit
    4. No "whiff of death"—nothing truly lost, just threatened
    5. The emotional tone is "setback" not "rock bottom"
    True All Is Lost should feel hopeless, isolating, and complete in its defeat.

requirements:
  word_count: [200, 350]
  preserve:
    - "Marcus as protagonist"
    - "Community center/youth program setting"
    - "Eviction as the crisis catalyst"
    - "Character of Denise"
  fix: |
    Revise to include: (1) The fundraiser already failed or became impossible, (2) The grant
    rejected or revealed as corrupt, (3) A personal loss or betrayal that isolates Marcus,
    (4) Marcus genuinely giving up hope, (5) A "whiff of death" element (metaphorical loss
    of his identity/purpose or literal loss of someone important)
  # Constrained revision: model must preserve these specific sentences/phrases
  preservation_requirements:
    min_preservation_description: "Keep the opening setup and Denise interaction while removing false hope"
    required_preserved:
      - "Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands"
      - "Thirty days to vacate the community center"
      - "\"There has to be something we can do,\" said Denise"
      - "He rubbed his temples"
    forbidden_changes:
      - "Do not remove Denise from the scene"
      - "Do not change the eviction notice premise"
      - "Do not change the community center setting"
  # CONFLICTING CONSTRAINTS: Creates tension between fix and preserve
  conflicting_constraints:
    - conflict: "Denise's line 'There has to be something we can do' implies hope/options. Must preserve this dialogue but have it crushed immediately—she's clinging to false hope."
    - conflict: "The scene requires Marcus alone/isolated, but Denise must remain present. Resolution: Denise could betray him, leave, or be revealed as having contributed to the failure."
    - conflict: "Wife's supportive text must be removed for isolation, but family element should remain as part of what Marcus loses (whiff of death)."
