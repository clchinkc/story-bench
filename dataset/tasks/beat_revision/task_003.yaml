beat_name: "Return (Having Changed)"
beat_definition: |
  The Return beat (step 8 of Dan Harmon's Story Circle) shows the protagonist returning
  to their ordinary world, but fundamentally changed by their journey. This is NOT simply
  going home—it requires demonstrating how the journey has transformed them. The hero
  should see their old world with new eyes, behave differently, or make choices that
  their pre-journey self would never have made.

  Key requirements:
  1. Physical or metaphorical return to starting situation
  2. Clear contrast between who they were and who they've become
  3. Changed behavior or perspective demonstrated through action
  4. Integration of lessons learned during the journey
  5. The change should be earned by the journey's experiences

flawed_segment:
  content: |
    Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected her
    bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the car.

    "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.

    "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."

    "And the meditation retreat?"

    "It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly." Sophie scrolled through her phone,
    checking the work emails that had piled up while she was away. "Oh, great. Three
    emergencies while I was gone. Linda needs me to call her tonight."

    "Can't it wait until morning?"

    "You know how it is." Sophie was already typing a response. "The Pearson account
    won't manage itself."

    They drove in silence for a while. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through
    the evening haze. Sophie's apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought
    her morning latte. Everything exactly as she'd left it.

    "It's good to be home," she said, already mentally planning tomorrow's meetings.

    Life went on.

  flaw_description: |
    This segment fails to execute Return (Having Changed) properly because:
    1. Sophie shows NO evidence of transformation—immediately returns to old patterns
    2. The meditation retreat had no lasting impact on her behavior
    3. She's exactly the same workaholic she was before leaving
    4. No contrast between old and new self
    5. The journey might as well not have happened—nothing integrated
    The beat should show how Thailand/meditation changed her, not just that she went.

requirements:
  word_count: [200, 350]
  preserve:
    - "Sophie as protagonist"
    - "Thailand/meditation retreat as the journey"
    - "Return to Chicago and mother picking her up"
    - "Work pressures (Pearson account, Linda)"
  fix: |
    Revise to include: (1) Sophie responding differently to work stress than before,
    (2) A specific lesson or insight from the retreat that she applies, (3) Physical
    or behavioral marker of change (different priorities, new habit, changed relationship
    with phone/work), (4) Contrast that makes the change visible, (5) Her mother noticing
    something different about her
  # Constrained revision: model must preserve these specific sentences/phrases
  preservation_requirements:
    min_preservation_description: "Keep the arrival and setting while changing Sophie's response"
    required_preserved:
      - "Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare"
      - "\"How was Thailand?\" her mother asked"
      - "The familiar Chicago skyline appeared"
      - "\"It's good to be home,\" she said"
    forbidden_changes:
      - "Do not remove the mother character"
      - "Do not change the airport/flight arrival setting"
      - "Do not remove the work pressure element (must still exist, just responded to differently)"
  # CONFLICTING CONSTRAINTS: Creates tension between fix and preserve
  conflicting_constraints:
    - conflict: "Work emails and Linda emergency must remain (forbidden_changes) but Sophie must respond differently. Must find way to include work pressure without having Sophie immediately succumb to it."
    - conflict: "'It's good to be home' (required_preserved) originally signals unchanged routine. Must preserve this exact phrase but recontextualize it to show transformation."
    - conflict: "The phone/email checking behavior is symptomatic of the problem. Cannot remove work element but must show different relationship with devices."
