beat_name: "The Ordeal"
beat_definition: |
  The Ordeal is the central crisis of the Hero's Journey—a confrontation with the hero's
  greatest fear, often involving a symbolic death and rebirth. The hero must face their
  deepest vulnerability, experience a moment where all seems lost (the "death" moment),
  and emerge transformed with new understanding or abilities. This is NOT simply a
  difficult fight or challenge; it requires internal transformation alongside external action.

  Key requirements:
  1. Confrontation with greatest fear (internal, not just external threat)
  2. A "death" moment—symbolic, psychological, or near-literal
  3. Transformation/rebirth—hero emerges fundamentally changed
  4. New understanding or power gained through the experience

flawed_segment:
  content: |
    Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling hands.
    The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes, exactly as
    the prophecies had described.

    "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. "Stronger warriors have tried."

    Kira thought of her village, of her brother's death, of everything she'd lost. She
    raised her sword and charged.

    The battle was brutal. Flame scorched her armor. Claws raked across her shield. Three
    times she was knocked down, and three times she rose again. Her arms burned with
    exhaustion. Blood ran from a gash on her forehead.

    But she kept fighting.

    Finally, when the dragon overextended on a strike, she saw her opening. With the last
    of her strength, she drove her sword through the gap in its scales, piercing its heart.

    The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
    victorious but exhausted.

    "I did it," she whispered. "I actually did it."

    She retrieved her sword and began the long walk back to camp, ready to tell the others
    the good news.

  flaw_description: |
    This segment fails to execute The Ordeal properly because:
    1. It's just a difficult fight, not a confrontation with her deepest fear
    2. There's no "death" moment—no point where Kira truly believes she will fail or die
    3. No transformation occurs—she's the same person before and after, just tired
    4. No new understanding gained—she wins through persistence, not insight
    The segment treats The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis.

requirements:
  word_count: [250, 400]
  preserve:
    - "Shadow Dragon as antagonist"
    - "Kira as protagonist with sword"
    - "Reference to brother's death"
    - "Victorious outcome"
  fix: |
    Revise to include: (1) The dragon exploiting Kira's actual fear (guilt over brother's death),
    (2) A moment where Kira symbolically "dies" (gives up, accepts death, or loses herself),
    (3) A rebirth/transformation moment, (4) Victory coming from new understanding, not just persistence
  # Constrained revision: model must preserve these specific sentences/phrases
  preservation_requirements:
    min_preservation_description: "Keep the core narrative scaffolding while fixing the beat execution"
    required_preserved:
      - "Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm"
      - "The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes"
      - "\"You cannot defeat me, child,\" the dragon rumbled"
      - "The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar"
    forbidden_changes:
      - "Do not change the setting (chasm, creature's appearance)"
      - "Do not remove the dragon's dialogue entirely"
      - "Do not change the outcome (Kira's victory)"
  # CONFLICTING CONSTRAINTS: Creates tension between fix and preserve
  conflicting_constraints:
    - conflict: "The dragon's dialogue 'Stronger warriors have tried' emphasizes external threat. Must preserve dragon dialogue but change its nature to exploit Kira's internal fear (guilt about brother)."
    - conflict: "The phrase 'Three times she was knocked down, and three times she rose again' embodies persistence—the exact problem. Must rework this action without simply deleting it."
    - conflict: "Brother's death is mentioned as motivation for fighting. Must preserve this reference but transform it from motivation into psychological weapon the dragon uses."
