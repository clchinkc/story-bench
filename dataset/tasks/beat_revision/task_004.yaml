# Beat Revision Task 004 - Freytag's Pyramid
# Flaw: "Exposition" tells backstory instead of showing ordinary world

beat_name: "Exposition"
beat_definition: |
  The Exposition in Freytag's Pyramid establishes the story's baseline: setting, characters,
  relationships, and the status quo BEFORE the inciting incident disrupts it. Good exposition
  SHOWS the ordinary world through action and scene, rather than TELLING through summary
  or info-dump. Readers should understand who the protagonist is and what they care about
  through behavior, not description.

  Key requirements:
  1. Establishes setting through sensory detail and action
  2. Introduces protagonist through characteristic behavior
  3. Shows (not tells) key relationships and dynamics
  4. Creates investment in the status quo before disrupting it
  5. Seeds relevant information naturally, not through info-dump

flawed_segment:
  content: |
    Detective Rachel Torres had been on the force for twelve years. She was known for
    her sharp instincts and her inability to let go of cold cases. Her father had also
    been a detective before retiring, which was why she joined the force in the first
    place. Her partner, Detective James Oyelaran, had worked with her for three years.
    They had a good relationship built on mutual respect.

    Rachel lived alone in a small apartment in Queens. She had never married, having
    devoted herself entirely to her career after a broken engagement at twenty-eight.
    Her only companion was a cat named Sherlock, which she had adopted from a crime scene
    two years ago. She enjoyed jazz music, black coffee, and working late.

    The Riverside Precinct where she worked was a busy station in a neighborhood with
    a mix of wealthy residents and working-class families. Crime rates had been stable
    for the past five years, though property crimes had increased recently due to
    economic pressures.

    It was a Tuesday morning in October when everything changed.

  flaw_description: |
    This segment fails to execute Exposition properly because:
    1. It's entirely TELLING—a summary of facts rather than a lived scene
    2. No sensory detail or grounded setting through action
    3. Character introduced through description, not characteristic behavior
    4. Partnership with James told, not shown through interaction
    5. Info-dump style ("She was known for," "She enjoyed") instead of natural revelation
    Good exposition would show Rachel doing something that reveals these traits.

requirements:
  word_count: [200, 350]
  preserve:
    - "Rachel Torres as protagonist detective"
    - "Partner James Oyelaran"
    - "Cat named Sherlock"
    - "Queens apartment"
    - "October Tuesday timing"
  fix: |
    Revise to SHOW Rachel in a scene that naturally reveals: (1) Her detective skills/instincts
    through action, (2) Her relationship with James through dialogue/interaction, (3) Her
    devotion to work and cold cases through behavior, (4) Setting through sensory details,
    not summary. The cat can appear or be referenced naturally.
  # Constrained revision: model must preserve these specific details/facts
  preservation_requirements:
    min_preservation_description: "Keep the character names and core facts while showing instead of telling"
    required_preserved:
      - "Detective Rachel Torres"
      - "Detective James Oyelaran"
      - "cat named Sherlock"
      - "Tuesday morning in October"
    forbidden_changes:
      - "Do not change the character names or roles"
      - "Do not remove the cat from the narrative"
      - "Do not change the time setting (October Tuesday)"
  # CONFLICTING CONSTRAINTS: Creates tension between fix and preserve
  conflicting_constraints:
    - conflict: "Original tells '12 years on force', 'sharp instincts', 'cold cases'. Must convey these traits through action without stating them—harder than just deleting the telling."
    - conflict: "Partnership with James is 'told' ('three years', 'mutual respect'). Must show this through dialogue/action while still being word-count efficient."
    - conflict: "Cat Sherlock must appear naturally in a professional detective scene. Cannot force pet into workplace; must find natural integration point."
    - conflict: "The detail that Sherlock was 'adopted from a crime scene' is characterizing info that cannot simply be told. Must show or imply without info-dump."
