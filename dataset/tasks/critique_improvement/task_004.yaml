  protagonist: |
    Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker who has
    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for
    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident's schedule.
  setting: |
    A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated or
    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.

    When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will take 6 months,
    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting
    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.
