story_context:
  protagonist: |
    Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn't laughed genuinely
    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately
    battling depression he won't acknowledge.
  setting: |
    A Los Angeles writers' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered
    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people
    trying to be funny on deadline.
  central_conflict: |
    When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose between
    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he
    loved comedy.
  tone: "Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving"

required_beats:
  - "Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow)"
  - "Theme Stated (someone says what the story is really about)"
  - "Catalyst (the new writer arrives)"

constraints:
  - "Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he's sad"
  - "The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus"
  - "Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail"
  - "The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus"
  - "Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke"
