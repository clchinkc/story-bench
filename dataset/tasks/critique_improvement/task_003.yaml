story_context:
  protagonist: |
    Zara, a 12-year-old girl growing up in a post-climate-change coastal city
    where most adults have given up hope. She builds things from salvage and
    believes solutions exist if people would just look for them.
  setting: |
    New Boston, 2089. A city of floating platforms, recycled materials, and
    perpetual sea spray. What was once downtown is now called the Shallows.
  central_conflict: |
    When Zara discovers the location of a pre-flood archive containing lost
    environmental technology, she must convince cynical adults to help her
    retrieve it before a storm erases it forever.
  tone: "Hopeful but not naive, kinetic, youth-centered"
