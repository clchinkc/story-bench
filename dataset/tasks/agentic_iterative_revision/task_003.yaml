story_context:
  protagonist: |
    Mateo, a 16-year-old first-generation Mexican-American who has always
    been the "responsible one" in his family. Straight A's, part-time job,
    translator for his grandmother. He's never rebelled against anything.
  setting: |
    A small Arizona border town during the summer before senior year.
    Desert heat, aging strip malls, the weight of family expectation.
  central_conflict: |
    When Mateo is accepted to a prestigious summer science program 2000 miles
    away, he must choose between his own dreams and his family's reliance on
    him - and confront whether his "responsibility" is love or fear.
  tone: "Honest, warm but complicated, culturally specific"

required_beats:
  - "Exposition"
  - "Rising Action"
  - "Climax"

  - "Include a specific moment with his grandmother that crystallizes the choice"
  - "One adult must genuinely understand Mateo's dilemma"
  - "The cultural elements must feel authentic, not performative"
  - "The resolution must be earned through Mateo's growth"
