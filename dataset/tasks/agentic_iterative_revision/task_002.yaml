story_context:
  protagonist: |
    Imani Torres, a blind podcaster who hosts a true crime show from her
    apartment. Sharp-witted and observant in ways sighted people miss,
    she compensates with exceptional audio memory and pattern recognition.
  setting: |
    A gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhood during a humid summer. The sounds
    of construction, street vendors, and distant sirens form Imani's world.
  central_conflict: |
    When Imani's upstairs neighbor goes missing and police dismiss it as
    voluntary disappearance, she begins her own investigation - only to
    realize the clues are literally all around her.
