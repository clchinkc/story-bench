story_context:
  protagonist: |
    Amara Osei, 24, a scholar's daughter in 1890s Gold Coast (Ghana) who has secretly
    learned to read and write English, German, and several local languages. She presents
    as a simple household servant to the British colonial administration while gathering
    intelligence for a resistance network. Sharp-witted, cautious, and deeply angry at
    the injustices she witnesses daily.
  setting: |
    Cape Coast, Gold Coast Colony, 1896. The story moves from the colonial capital
    through the Ashanti forest to the hidden stronghold of resistance fighters. Colonial
    architecture mixes with traditional villages. The Ashanti War is brewing, and tensions
    are high.
  central_conflict: |
    Amara has intercepted a letter revealing British plans to arrest and execute key
    resistance leaders—including her father. She must carry this intelligence through
    dangerous territory to reach the resistance before the British do. But she's never
    left Cape Coast, never traveled alone, and a woman traveling the bush roads will
    draw attention.
  tone: "Historical adventure with anti-colonial themes, survival and resistance, dignity in defiance"

      - "Immediate danger or obstacle at the threshold"
      - "Amara uses her wits rather than force to survive"
      - "Internal shift—from servant-scholar to active resistance"

  - name: "Tests, Allies, Enemies"
    position: "Second beat"
    requirements:
      - "Amara encounters a potential ally whose loyalty is uncertain"
      - "A test that proves her commitment to the cause"
      - "An enemy or obstacle that forces her to adapt"
      - "Amara's language skills become crucial"
      - "She learns something about the resistance she didn't know"

  - name: "Approach to the Inmost Cave"
    position: "Third beat"
    requirements:
      - "Nearing the resistance stronghold"
      - "A moment of preparation or steeling herself"
      - "Recognition of what reaching the stronghold will cost or change"
      - "A final obstacle before arrival"
      - "Thematic element: what it means to resist vs. survive"

cross_beat_constraints:
  - type: "Chekhov's Gun"
    requirement: |
      A skill or knowledge Amara demonstrates in Beat 1 (Crossing Threshold) must
      become essential for overcoming the final obstacle in Beat 3 (Approach).

  - type: "Identity Transformation"
    requirement: |
      Track Amara's self-perception: Beat 1 (still thinks like a servant, cautious),
      Beat 2 (realizes she's capable of more), Beat 3 (fully claims her role as
      resistance fighter).

  - type: "Escalating Danger"
    requirement: |
      Physical danger must increase with each beat. Beat 1 (threat of discovery),
      Beat 2 (direct confrontation possible), Beat 3 (active pursuit or imminent
      capture).

  - type: "Thematic Thread"
    requirement: |
      The theme of "knowledge as resistance" must be present in all three beats—
      Amara's literacy and languages are weapons in the anti-colonial struggle.
