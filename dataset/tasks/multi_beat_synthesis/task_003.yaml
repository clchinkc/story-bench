story_context:
  protagonist: |
    Miriam "Miri" Delacroix, 35, a former museum conservator who was wrongfully
    accused of art theft and blacklisted from the industry. Now she actually
    steals art—but only pieces that were themselves stolen or illegally acquired.
    She returns them to their rightful owners. Dry wit, meticulous planner, trust
    issues from her betrayal. Working with a small crew she assembled.
  setting: |
    Contemporary Monaco during the Grand Prix. The target: a Renaissance painting
    stolen by Nazis, now in the private collection of a Russian oligarch, Viktor
    Sorokin. His yacht, the "Tsarina," is hosting a party during the race. The
    painting's rightful owner: a Jewish family in Amsterdam who've been fighting
    for its return for decades.
  central_conflict: |
    The heist itself seems straightforward—Miri's crew has infiltrated the party.
    But Sorokin has hired a private security consultant who knows Miri's methods
    intimately: her former mentor, the woman who framed her for theft in the first
    place. The heist becomes personal, and Miri must decide whether to prioritize
    the painting or her revenge.
  tone: "Ocean's Eleven meets art history, clever banter, tension beneath the glamour"
