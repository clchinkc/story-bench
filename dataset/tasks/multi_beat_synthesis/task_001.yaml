story_context:
  protagonist: |
    Dante Reyes, 28, a former street artist who discovered he can see the emotional
    residue left by strong feelings—visible as colors and shapes that cling to places
    and objects. A recovering addict, three years clean, carrying guilt about his
    younger sister's death from an overdose he couldn't prevent.
  setting: |
    Contemporary Chicago, but with a hidden underworld of "Resonants"—people with
    emotional sensitivity abilities. The main location is the abandoned Buckingham
    Hotel, now a nexus of accumulated emotional energy where the city's Resonants
    gather.
  central_conflict: |
    A serial killer is targeting Resonants, draining their abilities and leaving
    them emotionally hollow. Dante is drawn into the hunt when the killer's latest
    victim is his mentor, Rosa, who taught him to control his gift. The killer seems
    to know Dante specifically—and may be connected to his sister's death.
  tone: "Noir-tinged urban fantasy, melancholic but determined, redemption arc"

cross_beat_constraints:
  - type: "Chekhov's Gun"
    requirement: |
      An object or detail introduced in Beat 1 (Tests, Allies, Enemies) must be
      essential to resolving the Ordeal in Beat 3. Example: a specific ability,
      tool, or piece of information that seems minor at first.

  - type: "Character Arc Progression"
    requirement: |
      Dante's relationship with his guilt must evolve across all three beats:

      (guilt transformed or accepted).

  - type: "Rising Stakes"
    requirement: |
      Each beat must raise the stakes higher than the previous one. The tension
      and danger must escalate continuously.
