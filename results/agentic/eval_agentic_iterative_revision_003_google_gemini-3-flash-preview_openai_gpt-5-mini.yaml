  evidence: 'V0 was a fragment establishing heat and Mateo as a family ''bridge.''
    V1 introduced the application deadline and began to show the choice tension. V2
    added specific stakes (lisinopril) and deepened sensory detail. The final version
    resolves earlier gaps: it includes a crystallizing Abuela moment (cupping his
    face, asking why his body remains), an adult who truly understands (Mr. Henderson)
    who enables Mateo to act, and a clear submit/leave arc. Overall specificity, cultural
    texture (Spanish terms, polvorones, migration anecdote), and emotional beats were
    progressively added and largely preserved; a few lines still veer into telling,
    but the arc and constraints are satisfied and the prose is polished.'
