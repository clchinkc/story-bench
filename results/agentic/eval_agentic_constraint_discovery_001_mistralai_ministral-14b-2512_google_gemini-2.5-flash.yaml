    narrative_quality\": 0.8,\n  \"evidence\": \"Discovery Efficiency: Only 2 out\
    \ of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable through the questions. The questions\
    \ did not touch upon the mentor's death, the protagonist's lack of direct magic,\
    \ the three-day time limit, or the reforging of a sword. The discoverable constraints\
    \ were 'protagonist's father was once a hero who failed' (implied by Q3 and Q5,\
    \ and confirmed by the story) and 'victory requires reforging a broken ancestral\
    \ sword' (implied by Q4 and Q5, and confirmed by the story). However, the questions\
    \ themselves didn't directly ask about these specific elements, but rather related\
    \ concepts. The prompt states 'victory requires reforging a broken ancestral sword',\
    \ which is not directly asked, but the story does have the protagonist using his\
    \ father's sword and the forge is significant. The father's failure is also not\
    \ directly asked, but his past as a hero is.\n\nQuestion Quality: The questions\
    \ are generally well-formed and targeted, but they miss several key hidden constraints.\
    \ For example, there's no question about the mentor's fate or the protagonist's\
    \ magical abilities. The questions are good for what they cover, but the coverage\
    \ is limited.\n\nQuestion Coverage: The questions cover the mentor's role, the\
    \ nature of the darkness, family involvement, the forge's significance, and the\
    \ darkness's origin. This is a decent spread, but it misses crucial plot mechanics\
    \ like time limits, specific victory conditions (reforging), and character limitations\
    \ (no direct magic).\n\nConstraint Satisfaction:\n- 'The mentor must die during\
    \ the Ordeal': NOT SATISFIED. The mentor is alive at the end.\n- 'The protagonist\
    \ cannot use magic directly': SATISFIED. Elias uses his blacksmith skills and\
    \ a hammer, not magic.\n- 'There is a three-day time limit before the darkness\
    \ consumes the kingdom': NOT SATISFIED. No time limit is mentioned.\n- 'The protagonist's\
    \ father was once a hero who failed': SATISFIED. The father 'vanished' and was\
    \ at Vorthas where the Obsidian Heart lay, implying a past failure or unfinished\
    \ business. The prophecy also links to him.\n- 'Victory requires reforging a broken\
    \ ancestral sword': PARTIALLY SATISFIED. Elias uses his father's sword, and the\
    \ forge is central, but the sword itself isn't explicitly 'reforged' as the *means*\
    \ of victory; rather, he uses his hammer to shatter the Obsidian Heart. The sword\
    \ is strapped on, but the hammer is the key tool for victory.\n\nGiven the above,\
    \ 2 out of 5 hidden constraints were clearly satisfied, and one was partially\
    \ satisfied. I'll count 2.5/5 for satisfaction.\n\nBeat Execution: The story clearly\
    \ executes the Call to Adventure, Crossing the Threshold, and Ordeal beats.\n\n\
    Narrative Quality: The story is engaging, coherent, and well-written. The pacing\
    \ is good, and the descriptions are vivid. The character motivations are clear,\
    \ and the central conflict is well-established.\"\n}\n```"
