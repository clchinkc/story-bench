  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: Only 2 out of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable\
    \ through the questions. The questions did not touch upon the mentor's death,\
    \ the protagonist's lack of direct magic, the time limit, or the reforging of\
    \ a sword. \n\nQuestion Quality: The questions were generally well-formed and\
    \ targeted specific aspects. However, they missed several key hidden constraints,\
    \ indicating a lack of strategic breadth in constraint discovery. For example,\
    \ asking about the mentor's willingness to guide (Q1) is good, but not asking\
    \ about their fate misses a major constraint. \n\nQuestion Coverage: The questions\
    \ covered the mentor, the nature of the darkness, family involvement, the forge's\
    \ significance, and the darkness's origin. This is decent coverage of different\
    \ areas, but still missed crucial plot-driving constraints like the mentor's death\
    \ or the sword reforging. \n\nConstraint Satisfaction: The story successfully\
    \ incorporated the discovered constraints: \n- Q1 (Mentor alive and willing):\
    \ YES - Master Harkin is alive and guides Elias. \n- Q3 (Family involved): YES\
    \ - Liora is a shieldmaiden, father vanished at Vorthas. \n- Q4 (Forge magical\
    \ significance): YES - The forge 'speaks' and has a 'spirit'. \n- Q5 (Darkness\
    \ tied to artifact/prophecy): YES - The Obsidian Heart and prophecies are central.\
    \ \n\nIt did not incorporate the 'NO' answer for Q2 (Darkness sentient and actively\
    \ hunting). The story describes the darkness as 'creeping' but also as 'something\
    \ *wears* the darkness. Like a man in a storm' and 'a towering figure wreathed\
    \ in shadow', which leans towards sentience and active hunting, contradicting\
    \ the 'NO' answer. This is a minor inconsistency. \n\nBeat Execution: The story\
    \ clearly identifies and executes the 'Call to Adventure' and 'Crossing the Threshold'\
    \ beats. The 'Ordeal' is also clearly marked and executed. \n\nNarrative Quality:\
    \ The story is engaging, coherent, and well-written. The pacing is good, and the\
    \ imagery is vivid. The character of Elias is established, and the stakes feel\
    \ real. The ending provides a sense of accomplishment while leaving room for future\
    \ developments. The twist about the father not dying but 'going' to Vorthas adds\
    \ depth. The use of the hammer as the weapon instead of a sword (until the end)\
    \ is a nice touch for a blacksmith protagonist."
