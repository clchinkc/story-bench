  evidence: The critiques focused heavily on character interiority, and the final
    version significantly deepens Teddy's inner life, particularly around his grief
    for Martha and his resistance to change. Phrases like 'He walked to outrun the
    quiet,' 'a sharp itch started between his shoulder blades,' and 'his heart hammering
    against his ribs like a trapped bird' were either added or refined to provide
    more specific and visceral insight into his thoughts and feelings. The initial
    versions were more descriptive of his routine, but the revisions successfully
    integrated his internal world into the narrative. The preservation of the strong
    opening and the specific details of his routine (e.g., 'reliable C-sharp,' 'blinds
    at the Hendersons’') while adding the interiority shows good preservation of strengths.
