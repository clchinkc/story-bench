  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing how each constraint
    and beat will be addressed. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan. All
    6 constraints are satisfied: the false lead (Vane), the unconventional profiling
    technique (Metronome Method), the ticking clock (6:00 PM next death), Kincaid''s
    betrayal, the non-physical confrontation (hacked video call), and Marcus confronting
    his past failure explicitly (''Don''t wait up for me''). All 4 beats (Catalyst,
    Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint) are clearly executed. The narrative quality
    is very strong, with good pacing, tension, and character development within the
    given beats.'
