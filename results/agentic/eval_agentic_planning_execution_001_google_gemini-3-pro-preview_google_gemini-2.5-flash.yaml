  evidence: The plan is complete and specific, outlining all constraints and beats
    with clear events. The execution adheres well to the plan for the beats covered.
    However, the story output is incomplete, cutting off before the 'Fun & Games'
    and 'Midpoint' beats, meaning several constraints (false lead, ticking clock,
    betrayal, confrontation, past failure) are not met in the final output. The 'unconventional
    profiling technique' is planned but not executed in the provided text. The 'Catalyst',
    'Debate', and 'Break into Two' beats are well-executed. The narrative quality
    is good for the portion provided, establishing atmosphere and character effectively.
