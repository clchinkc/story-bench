  evidence: 'The initial versions (0-3) were identical, indicating no changes were
    made based on critiques. However, the final output shows significant improvements
    that address the constraints. Sarah''s methodical nature is clearly shown through
    her actions (notebook, precise strokes, steady breath, tapping pen). The fog serves
    a narrative purpose by obscuring visibility, creating tension, and even acting
    as a metaphorical ''wall'' or ''waiting'' entity. Elias Vane''s secret about recognizing
    Mercer and the missing girl is revealed. Mercer''s past case is hinted at (''the
    case that got away'') before his identity is revealed. The story ends on a clear
    moment of decision for Sarah: whether to follow the drag marks or go back for
    Elias''s information. The prose is engaging and the pacing is effective.'
