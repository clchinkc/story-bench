  evidence: Questions elicited family ties and mentor/master presence (3 of 5 hidden
    constraints hinted). They missed the mentor-death, three-day deadline, father's
    failed-hero backstory, and reforging requirement. In the story only the 'protagonist
    does not use magic directly' constraint is respected (magic provided by a mage/enchantment).
    Mentor survives (violates mentor-death), no time limit mentioned, no father-hero
    failure, and victory comes via an enchanted blade rather than reforging an ancestral
    broken sword. The narrative is coherent and engaging but omits most required beats.
