  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing behavioral
    cues, dialogue, and thematic elements for each beat. The final output adheres
    perfectly to this detailed plan. All constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is
    shown through specific behaviors (AI assistant, rigid posture, avoiding eye contact,
    swiping away mother''s hologram, identical meal packs, never answering personal
    calls). The alien signal feels genuinely alien (''functional. Like a cell dividing.
    Or a star collapsing,'' ''patterns matched human brainwave activity during trauma,''
    ''screaming,'' ''lullaby''). Elias Voss challenges Yuki''s approach with his human-centric
    suggestions and observations. Dr. Lien Zhao is an unconventional mentor (penguin,
    making Yuki wait, forcing introspection). The Threshold is psychological, focusing
    on Yuki confronting her own pain and vulnerability. The moment of genuine human
    connection is when Voss offers coffee and tells her ''You’re not a machine, Yuki.
    You’re allowed to be tired,'' and later when he holds her hand. The beats (Call
    to Adventure, Refusal, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing the Threshold) are all clearly
    executed. The narrative quality is strong, with good pacing and emotional depth,
    though the ending feels a little rushed in its resolution of the UN conflict.'
