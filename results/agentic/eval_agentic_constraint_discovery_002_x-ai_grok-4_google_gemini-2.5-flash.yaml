  evidence: 'Discovery Efficiency: Only 2 out of 5 constraints were discoverable.
    The questions missed the critical system failure, the low crew survival rate,
    and the AI''s attachment to a child. The ''additional characters'' question led
    to the crew constraint, and ''setting/environment'' led to the uninhabitable planet,
    but the AI did not incorporate the latter. Question Quality: Questions were somewhat
    generic and didn''t probe deeply enough to uncover the more nuanced constraints.
    For example, ''additional characters'' is broad. Question Coverage: Questions
    covered personality, characters, plot, setting, and tone, which is decent coverage,
    but the specificity was lacking. Constraint Satisfaction: Only the ''additional
    characters'' constraint (human crew) was incorporated, but not the specific detail
    of only 12% remaining. The ''uninhabitable planet'' constraint was not incorporated
    at all. Beat Execution: The story successfully identified and executed the catalyst
    and Act Two break. Narrative Quality: The story is well-written and engaging,
    with good pacing and character introduction. However, it misses key dramatic tension
    points due to the undiscovered constraints.'
