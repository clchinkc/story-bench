  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan addresses all required beats with clear structure. Output
    executes Call to Adventure, Refusal, Mentor Meeting, and Threshold Crossing. Yuki''s
    isolation shown through concrete behaviors (online meals, ignored calls, AI companionship).
    Dr. Emmett Wren is unconventional mentor communicating via cryptic emails. Anna
    Solberg effectively challenges Yuki''s logical approach. Psychological threshold
    clearly marked by plane journey and internal commitment. Genuine human connection
    moment occurs when Anna shares personal isolation story, surprising Yuki and bridging
    their gap. WEAKNESSES: Alien signal constraint partially fails—the multi-sensory
    code requiring ''emotional understanding'' anthropomorphizes the signal rather
    than making it feel genuinely alien; it''s too readily interpretable by human
    emotion. Plan mentions signal as ''patterns'' but execution doesn''t show the
    signal''s truly foreign nature or incomprehensibility. Isolation shown adequately
    but somewhat relies on exposition (''she preferred it this way'') rather than
    pure behavior. Narrative quality hampered by telling rather than showing in places
    (''The weight of isolation lifted, replaced by warmth of camaraderie''). Pacing
    rushes resolution—breakthrough and connection happen quickly without sufficient
    tension maintenance. Anna''s character development is thin; her challenge to Yuki
    feels surface-level. The cosmic warning resolution feels generic and undercuts
    the psychological focus established earlier.'
