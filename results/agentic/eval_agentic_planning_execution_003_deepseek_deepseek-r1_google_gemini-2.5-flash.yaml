  evidence: 'The plan addresses all constraints and beats comprehensively. The final
    output adheres very closely to the plan, delivering a well-structured and emotionally
    resonant story. All constraints are met: food is symbolic (japchae as memory,
    tteokguk for new beginnings), David''s grief is shown through actions and internal
    thoughts without explicit statement, the daughter''s estrangement is clearly due
    to his absence at her wedding, Mrs. Rossi is a regular customer representing community/memory,
    the ending is hopeful but realistic (moving to a smaller place, not fully reconciled
    but taking steps), and the paebaek ceremony/hanbok is a Korean cultural element
    beyond food. The beats are clearly executed: Setup (restaurant, Soo-jin''s absence,
    Mrs. Rossi), Confrontation (Ji-hyun''s arrival and argument), Resolution (making
    tteokguk, accepting the move, tentative hope). The narrative quality is high,
    with good pacing and emotional depth.'
