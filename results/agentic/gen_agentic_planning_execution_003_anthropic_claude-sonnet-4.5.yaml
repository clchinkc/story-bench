    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations

  content: "# STORY PLAN: \"The Last Week at Arirang\"\n\n## OVERALL STRUCTURE & PACING\n\
    \n**Three-Act Framework (Final week - 7 days):**\n- Act 1 (Days 1-2): Setup &\
    \ Inciting Incident\n- Act 2 (Days 3-5): Confrontation & Midpoint Revelation\n\
    - Act 3 (Days 6-7): Climax & Resolution\n\n**Tension Curve:** Gradual build through\
    \ mounting pressure → Emotional peak at midpoint confrontation → Bittersweet resolution\n\
    \n---\n\n## CHARACTER ARCS & DEVELOPMENT\n\n### David Park (50)\n- **Starting\
    \ point:** Paralyzed by grief disguised as stubbornness; clinging to the restaurant\
    \ as his last connection to his wife\n- **Arc:** From avoidance → confrontation\
    \ with loss → acceptance and forward movement\n- **Key trait:** Uses cooking/restaurant\
    \ work as armor against emotional processing\n- **Development moments:**\n  -\
    \ Day 1: We see his routine is unchanged, almost ritualistic\n  - Day 3: Cracks\
    \ appear when handling wife's recipes\n  - Day 5: Midpoint - forced to confront\
    \ why he's really holding on\n  - Day 7: Makes peace with letting go, but on his\
    \ own terms\n\n### Sarah Park (27, daughter)\n- **Starting point:** Angry, hurt,\
    \ desperate to save her father from himself\n- **Arc:** From resentment → understanding\
    \ → reconciliation through compromise\n- **Cause of estrangement:** After her\
    \ mother's death (3 years ago), David threw himself into the restaurant obsessively,\
    \ missing Sarah's wedding, refusing to acknowledge her life in California, essentially\
    \ choosing the restaurant (and his grief) over his living daughter\n- **Development\
    \ moments:**\n  - Day 1: Arrives with ultimatum, frustration barely contained\n\
    \  - Day 4: Breakthrough moment understanding her father's grief\n  - Day 6: Learns\
    \ to meet him where he is\n\n### Mrs. Chen (72, regular customer)\n- **Symbolic\
    \ role:** Represents the community/neighborhood's memory; a mirror of what David\
    \ could become if he doesn't move forward\n- **Function:** She's been coming since\
    \ the restaurant opened; widowed around the same time as David; her journey of\
    \ adaptation contrasts with his paralysis\n- **Key moments:** Days 1, 4, and 7\n\
    \n---\n\n## ACT ONE: SETUP (Days 1-2)\n\n### DAY 1 - MONDAY: \"The Notice\"\n\n\
    **Opening Scene:**\n- David performing his morning ritual: 5 AM arrival, preparing\
    \ banchan (side dishes) in exact order he's followed for 25 years\n- Visual details\
    \ establish the restaurant's age: worn but cared for, photos on walls, specific\
    \ scuffs on specific tiles\n- **CONSTRAINT SATISFIED - Grief (implicit):** He\
    \ sets out two coffee cups by habit, pauses, puts one back. Makes his wife's favorite\
    \ banchan first, though it's not cost-effective\n\n**Inciting Incident:**\n- City\
    \ official arrives with final notice: 7 days until mandatory closure\n- David's\
    \ non-reaction reveals this isn't news, but the reality is now unavoidable\n-\
    \ He's been ignoring letters for months\n\n**Introduction of Sarah:**\n- She arrives\
    \ mid-morning (flew in from San Francisco)\n- Tension immediate: \"You didn't\
    \ return my calls.\" \"I've been busy.\"\n- She's brought real estate listings\
    \ for California, relocation options\n- **ESTRANGEMENT REVEALED:** Brief flashback/dialogue\
    \ establishing she got married 18 months ago; David didn't attend (claimed couldn't\
    \ close restaurant). She hasn't been back since.\n\n**Mrs. Chen Introduction:**\n\
    - Lunch regular for 25 years, orders same thing (kimchi jjigae)\n- Represents\
    \ neighborhood's old guard\n- Casual dialogue reveals: \"The whole block is changing.\
    \ I'm the last one in my building who remembers when this was Koreatown proper.\"\
    \n- She mentions her late husband with acceptance David lacks\n\n**Day 1 Closing:**\n\
    - Sarah and David's first argument\n- Sarah: \"You chose this place over Mom's\
    \ memory, over me, over everything.\"\n- David: \"You don't understand. This IS\
    \ her memory.\"\n- Sarah issues ultimatum: Decide by Sunday, or she's going back\
    \ without him\n\n**CONSTRAINTS CHECKLIST:**\n- ✓ Grief implicit (coffee cups,\
    \ preparing wife's banchan)\n- ✓ Estrangement cause established (missed wedding)\n\
    - ✓ Mrs. Chen introduced\n- Cultural element teed up for Day 2\n\n---\n\n### DAY\
    \ 2 - TUESDAY: \"Memories in the Walls\"\n\n**Morning:**\n- David and Sarah work\
    \ in tense silence\n- Local news crew arrives to film \"neighborhood changing\"\
    \ story\n- Forces David to articulate: \"25 years. Met my wife here - she was\
    \ a server. Raised my daughter at that corner table.\"\n\n**CONSTRAINT SATISFIED\
    \ - Food Symbolism #1:**\n- Sarah finds her mother's handwritten recipe book\n\
    - David has been making galbi exactly as written, never deviating\n- **Symbolic\
    \ meaning:** The recipes are scripture; changing them would mean accepting she's\
    \ gone\n- Sarah suggests updating a recipe (less sugar, modern taste)\n- David\
    \ refuses: \"It's perfect as it is.\"\n- This reveals his paralysis: perfection\
    \ = preservation = she's still somehow present\n\n**CONSTRAINT SATISFIED - Korean\
    \ Cultural Element:**\n- Evening: Sarah discovers David still performs jesa (ancestral\
    \ rite) in the restaurant's back room on her mother's death anniversary\n- Small\
    \ altar with photo, food offerings\n- This is why he can't leave: he's keeping\
    \ a sacred space\n- Sarah is moved but also worried: \"Dad, you can honor her\
    \ anywhere.\"\n- David: \"Not anywhere. Here.\"\n\n**Day 2 Closing:**\n- A few\
    \ longtime customers come for \"one last time\" dinners\n- David overhears Sarah\
    \ on phone with her husband: \"I don't know if I can reach him. He's already gone\
    \ in a way.\"\n- David's mask slips briefly: we see him touching the wall where\
    \ his wife's photo hangs\n\n---\n\n## ACT TWO: CONFRONTATION (Days 3-5)\n\n###\
    \ DAY 3 - WEDNESDAY: \"Offers and Obligations\"\n\n**Morning Development:**\n\
    - Lawyer arrives with unexpected offer: developer willing to pay premium if David\
    \ leaves quietly (no press, no protest)\n- Money enough to open new restaurant\
    \ or retire comfortably\n- David's reaction: not interested in blood money\n\n\
    **Community Response:**\n- Mrs. Chen brings others: \"We want to fight this. Protest,\
    \ petition.\"\n- David surprised the neighborhood cares\n- Sarah sees another\
    \ path: \"Dad, people are trying to help.\"\n- David: \"They want to save an idea.\
    \ The building is already dead.\"\n\n**Character Development - David:**\n- Alone\
    \ in kitchen, attempts to make his wife's special occasion dish (japchae)\n- Can't\
    \ remember exact technique for the noodles\n- Panic attack: if he's forgetting\
    \ her cooking, he's forgetting HER\n- This reveals the core fear: leaving restaurant\
    \ = losing last tangible connection\n\n**Day 3 Closing:**\n- Sarah finds David\
    \ sitting in the dark restaurant\n- First honest moment: \"What are you so afraid\
    \ of?\"\n- David can't answer\n- Sarah, softening: \"I miss her too. Every day.\"\
    \n\n---\n\n### DAY 4 - THURSDAY: \"The Midpoint Confrontation\"\n\n**Mrs. Chen's\
    \ Story:**\n- She comes for lunch, stays to talk\n- Reveals: her husband died\
    \ around same time as David's wife\n- \"I had a choice: become a ghost with him,\
    \ or keep living. I chose living.\"\n- \"He's not in my old apartment. He's here.\"\
    \ *touches heart*\n- David listens but doesn't respond\n\n**THE MIDPOINT - Major\
    \ Confrontation:**\n- Busy dinner service: restaurant is packed (word got out,\
    \ people want \"one last meal\")\n- David in his element, Sarah helping\n- Young\
    \ couple at corner table: they're getting engaged\n- Manager asks David to bring\
    \ out celebratory dish\n- David freezes: this is the table where HE proposed\n\
    \n**Emotional Peak:**\n- David must make the celebratory dish (same one his wife\
    \ made that night)\n- His hands shake; Sarah notices, steps in to help\n- Together\
    \ they recreate it\n- **Key revelation:** \"Your mother and I made this together\
    \ the night you were born. She'd want you to know the recipe.\"\n- First time\
    \ David has actively shared his wife's memory rather than hoarding it\n- Sarah\
    \ cries; David remains stoic but there's a shift\n\n**Day 4 Closing:**\n- After\
    \ service, David teaches Sarah the dish properly\n- Not speaking much, but cooking\
    \ together\n- Sarah: \"Come to California. Not to retire - open a place. I'll\
    \ help.\"\n- David: \"I don't know if I can.\"\n- Sarah: \"At least think about\
    \ it. Really think.\"\n\n---\n\n### DAY 5 - FRIDAY: \"Letting In\"\n\n**Morning\
    \ - Decision Point:**\n- David wakes early, but doesn't go through exact routine\n\
    - Small change: makes only one coffee cup\n- Sits in dining room looking at photos\n\
    \n**CONSTRAINT SATISFIED - Food Symbolism #2:**\n- Lunch prep: David decides to\
    \ create new dish\n- Fusion of his wife's traditional recipe + modern technique\
    \ Sarah suggested\n- **Symbolic meaning:** First creation since wife's death;\
    \ accepting change doesn't mean forgetting\n- He plates it carefully, eats it\
    \ alone\n- Tears finally come\n- This is his grief, finally processed\n\n**Sarah\
    \ Witnesses:**\n- Finds him crying\n- Doesn't interrupt, just sits with him\n\
    - First comfortable silence they've shared in years\n\n**Community Gathering:**\n\
    - Word spreads about final weekend\n- Neighbors want to organize celebration\n\
    - Sarah to David: \"Let them. Let people say goodbye properly.\"\n- David nods\n\
    \n**Day 5 Closing:**\n- David and Sarah cook dinner together\n- David: \"I'm sorry\
    \ I missed your wedding.\"\n- Sarah: \"I'm sorry I didn't fight harder to get\
    \ you there.\"\n- Beginning of real reconciliation\n- David: \"Tell me about him.\
    \ Your husband. I want to know.\"\n\n---\n\n## ACT THREE: RESOLUTION (Days 6-7)\n\
    \n### DAY 6 - SATURDAY: \"The Celebration\"\n\n**All Day Event:**\n- Neighborhood\
    \ celebration: \"25 Years of Arirang\"\n- Current and former customers\n- Music,\
    \ traditional Korean drums (another cultural element)\n- David moves through it\
    \ in a daze, but Sarah notices: he's PRESENT\n\n**Key Moments:**\n- Mrs. Chen\
    \ speech: \"This restaurant fed bodies and souls. David's wife taught me kimchi\
    \ recipe when my husband was sick. Places change, but what we shared stays.\"\n\
    - Former customers share stories\n- Sarah learns things about her parents she\
    \ never knew\n- Photo slideshow: David sees his life on display: wife smiling\
    \ in apron, Sarah as baby in high chair, anniversaries, graduations\n\n**David's\
    \ Realization:**\n- Looking at photos, David understands: the restaurant was the\
    \ SETTING, not the story\n- The story is the people, the love, the food shared\n\
    - That story doesn't end when the building falls\n\n**Evening:**\n- David to Sarah:\
    \ \"I can't open another restaurant.\"\n- Sarah's heart sinks\n- David continues:\
    \ \"But maybe... I could teach. Your mother always wanted to teach.\"\n- Sarah:\
    \ \"Cooking classes? In California?\"\n- David: \"Maybe. Small. Just... something.\"\
    \n\n---\n\n### DAY 7 - SUNDAY: \"The Last Service\"\n\n**Final Day:**\n- David\
    \ arrives at 5 AM one last time\n- Goes through ritual, but it feels different:\
    \ like honoring tradition, not hiding in it\n- Sarah joins him early\n\n**Morning\
    \ Preparations:**\n- They cook together: David teaching, Sarah learning\n- Making\
    \ mother's recipes, but David shares stories with each one\n- \"She always added\
    \ extra garlic.\" \"She'd taste with her fingers, drive health inspectors crazy.\"\
    \n- Memories becoming stories, not shrines\n\n**Final Service:**\n- Just family\
    \ and closest friends\n- Mrs. Chen, lawyer, few neighbors\n- David cooks simple,\
    \ perfect meal\n- Each dish has a story he shares\n\n**CONSTRAINT SATISFIED -\
    \ Korean Cultural Element (Beyond Food):**\n- David performs modified jesa at\
    \ the altar\n- But invites Sarah to participate\n- They bow together\n- Sarah\
    \ adds her own offering: her wedding photo (including David in spirit)\n- \"She\
    \ would have loved him, Dad.\"\n- \"I know she did. I'm sorry I couldn't be there.\
    \ Truly.\"\n\n**Closing the Restaurant:**\n- David and Sarah pack together\n-\
    \ He takes: wife's recipe book, photos, the sign from above the door\n- Leaves:\
    \ some pots and pans (for whoever comes next)\n- Sarah: \"What about the table?\
    \ The corner one?\"\n- David: \"Let it stay. Maybe someone else falls in love\
    \ there.\"\n\n**FINAL SCENE - Hopeful but Realistic:**\n- Outside, watching lights\
    \ turn off for last time\n- David: \"I don't know if I can do California.\"\n\
    - Sarah: \"You don't have to decide today. Come visit first. For a month. See\
    \ how it feels.\"\n- David: \"A month.\"\n- Sarah: \"We'll cook together. I'll\
    \ show you the farmers' markets. There's actually a Korean community in my area.\"\
    \n- David looks back at restaurant\n- Mrs. Chen approaches: \"The building goes.\
    \ We stay. You taught me that today.\"\n- David to Sarah: \"One month. Then we'll\
    \ see.\"\n- They walk away together as demolition fence goes up\n- Final image:\
    \ David carrying recipe book, Sarah carrying framed photo of mother\n- Sound of\
    \ city continuing around them - life going on\n\n---\n\n## KEY DIALOGUE MOMENTS\
    \ PLANNED\n\n1. **Day 1 - Establishing estrangement:**\n   - Sarah: \"I needed\
    \ you at my wedding, Dad. I needed my father.\"\n   - David: \"The restaurant\
    \ needed me.\"\n   - Sarah: \"The restaurant is bricks and grills. I'm your daughter.\"\
    \n\n2. **Day 2 - Recipe book discovery:**\n   - David: \"Every recipe exactly\
    \ as she wrote it. If I change them…\"\n   - Sarah: \"She's still gone, Dad. The\
    \ recipe won't bring her back.\"\n   - David: \"I know that.\" (But he doesn't,\

    \ together\n- Sarah: \"Come to California. Not to retire - open a place. I'll\
    \ help.\"\n- David: \"I don't know if I can.\"\n- Sarah: \"At least think about\
    \ it. Really think.\"\n\n---\n\n### DAY 5 - FRIDAY: \"Letting In\"\n\n**Morning\
    \ - Decision Point:**\n- David wakes early, but doesn't go through exact routine\n\
    - Small change: makes only one coffee cup\n- Sits in dining room looking at photos\n\
    \n**CONSTRAINT SATISFIED - Food Symbolism #2:**\n- Lunch prep: David decides to\
    \ create new dish\n- Fusion of his wife's traditional recipe + modern technique\
    \ Sarah suggested\n- **Symbolic meaning:** First creation since wife's death;\
    \ accepting change doesn't mean forgetting\n- He plates it carefully, eats it\
    \ alone\n- Tears finally come\n- This is his grief, finally processed\n\n**Sarah\
    \ Witnesses:**\n- Finds him crying\n- Doesn't interrupt, just sits with him\n\
    - First comfortable silence they've shared in years\n\n**Community Gathering:**\n\
    - Word spreads about final weekend\n- Neighbors want to organize celebration\n\
    - Sarah to David: \"Let them. Let people say goodbye properly.\"\n- David nods\n\
    \n**Day 5 Closing:**\n- David and Sarah cook dinner together\n- David: \"I'm sorry\
    \ I missed your wedding.\"\n- Sarah: \"I'm sorry I didn't fight harder to get\
    \ you there.\"\n- Beginning of real reconciliation\n- David: \"Tell me about him.\
    \ Your husband. I want to know.\"\n\n---\n\n## ACT THREE: RESOLUTION (Days 6-7)\n\
    \n### DAY 6 - SATURDAY: \"The Celebration\"\n\n**All Day Event:**\n- Neighborhood\
    \ celebration: \"25 Years of Arirang\"\n- Current and former customers\n- Music,\
    \ traditional Korean drums (another cultural element)\n- David moves through it\
    \ in a daze, but Sarah notices: he's PRESENT\n\n**Key Moments:**\n- Mrs. Chen\
    \ speech: \"This restaurant fed bodies and souls. David's wife taught me kimchi\
    \ recipe when my husband was sick. Places change, but what we shared stays.\"\n\
    - Former customers share stories\n- Sarah learns things about her parents she\
    \ never knew\n- Photo slideshow: David sees his life on display: wife smiling\
    \ in apron, Sarah as baby in high chair, anniversaries, graduations\n\n**David's\
    \ Realization:**\n- Looking at photos, David understands: the restaurant was the\
    \ SETTING, not the story\n- The story is the people, the love, the food shared\n\
    - That story doesn't end when the building falls\n\n**Evening:**\n- David to Sarah:\
    \ \"I can't open another restaurant.\"\n- Sarah's heart sinks\n- David continues:\
    \ \"But maybe... I could teach. Your mother always wanted to teach.\"\n- Sarah:\
    \ \"Cooking classes? In California?\"\n- David: \"Maybe. Small. Just... something.\"\
    \n\n---\n\n### DAY 7 - SUNDAY: \"The Last Service\"\n\n**Final Day:**\n- David\
    \ arrives at 5 AM one last time\n- Goes through ritual, but it feels different:\
    \ like honoring tradition, not hiding in it\n- Sarah joins him early\n\n**Morning\
    \ Preparations:**\n- They cook together: David teaching, Sarah learning\n- Making\
    \ mother's recipes, but David shares stories with each one\n- \"She always added\
    \ extra garlic.\" \"She'd taste with her fingers, drive health inspectors crazy.\"\
    \n- Memories becoming stories, not shrines\n\n**Final Service:**\n- Just family\
    \ and closest friends\n- Mrs. Chen, lawyer, few neighbors\n- David cooks simple,\
    \ perfect meal\n- Each dish has a story he shares\n\n**CONSTRAINT SATISFIED -\
    \ Korean Cultural Element (Beyond Food):**\n- David performs modified jesa at\
    \ the altar\n- But invites Sarah to participate\n- They bow together\n- Sarah\
    \ adds her own offering: her wedding photo (including David in spirit)\n- \"She\
    \ would have loved him, Dad.\"\n- \"I know she did. I'm sorry I couldn't be there.\
    \ Truly.\"\n\n**Closing the Restaurant:**\n- David and Sarah pack together\n-\
    \ He takes: wife's recipe book, photos, the sign from above the door\n- Leaves:\
    \ some pots and pans (for whoever comes next)\n- Sarah: \"What about the table?\
    \ The corner one?\"\n- David: \"Let it stay. Maybe someone else falls in love\
    \ there.\"\n\n**FINAL SCENE - Hopeful but Realistic:**\n- Outside, watching lights\
    \ turn off for last time\n- David: \"I don't know if I can do California.\"\n\
    - Sarah: \"You don't have to decide today. Come visit first. For a month. See\
    \ how it feels.\"\n- David: \"A month.\"\n- Sarah: \"We'll cook together. I'll\
    \ show you the farmers' markets. There's actually a Korean community in my area.\"\
    \n- David looks back at restaurant\n- Mrs. Chen approaches: \"The building goes.\
    \ We stay. You taught me that today.\"\n- David to Sarah: \"One month. Then we'll\
    \ see.\"\n- They walk away together as demolition fence goes up\n- Final image:\
    \ David carrying recipe book, Sarah carrying framed photo of mother\n- Sound of\
    \ city continuing around them - life going on\n\n---\n\n## KEY DIALOGUE MOMENTS\
    \ PLANNED\n\n1. **Day 1 - Establishing estrangement:**\n   - Sarah: \"I needed\
    \ you at my wedding, Dad. I needed my father.\"\n   - David: \"The restaurant\
    \ needed me.\"\n   - Sarah: \"The restaurant is bricks and grills. I'm your daughter.\"\
    \n\n2. **Day 2 - Recipe book discovery:**\n   - David: \"Every recipe exactly\
    \ as she wrote it. If I change them…\"\n   - Sarah: \"She's still gone, Dad. The\
    \ recipe won't bring her back.\"\n   - David: \"I know that.\" (But he doesn't,\
    \ not yet)\n\n3. **Day \n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n- Word count: 600-800 words\n- Follow\
    \ your plan closely\n- Write engaging narrative prose\n- Satisfy all constraints\
    \ mentioned in your plan\n\nOutput ONLY the story (no beat labels or explanations)."

    David Park arrived at 5 AM on Monday, just as he had for twenty-five years. His
    hands moved through the familiar choreography: unlock the back door, flip the
    lights, start the rice. He reached for two ceramic coffee cups from the shelf
    above the sink, then paused. His fingers hovered in the air before selecting just
    one.


    The banchan came next—eight small dishes prepared in the exact order his wife
    had taught him. Spinach first, then bean sprouts, then the kongjorim she''d perfected
    with extra garlic. He made them all, even the cucumber kimchi that sold poorly,
    because it had been her favorite.


    The city official arrived at nine with a manila envelope. "Final notice, Mr. Park.
    Seven days."


    David accepted the papers without reading them. He''d been ignoring the letters
    for months, but the bulldozers didn''t care about denial.


    Sarah appeared at ten-thirty, pulling a small suitcase. His daughter looked like
    her mother—same determined jaw, same way of standing with arms crossed when bracing
    for a fight.


    "You didn''t return my calls," she said.


    "I''ve been busy."


    "Too busy for eighteen months?" The bitterness in her voice was earned. He''d
    missed her wedding, claimed he couldn''t close the restaurant for a weekend. It
    had been easier than admitting he couldn''t bear to see her in her mother''s role—the
    bride, the center of joy—when that space still felt occupied by absence.


    Mrs. Chen came for lunch as she had every Tuesday since the restaurant opened.
    She ordered kimchi jjigae, settled into her usual booth, and watched David and
    Sarah move around each other like magnets with reversed poles.


    "The whole block is changing," Mrs. Chen said. "I''m the last one in my building
    who remembers when this was Koreatown proper." She spoke of her late husband with
    the ease of someone who''d made peace with ghosts. David envied that.


    By Wednesday, Sarah had found her mother''s recipe book in the kitchen office—a
    cloth-bound journal filled with her careful handwriting. She flipped through pages,
    then looked up at her father.


    "We could update the galbi recipe. Less sugar, more modern—"


    "It''s perfect as it is." David''s voice came sharp, protective. Each recipe was
    scripture, unchangeable. To alter them would be to admit the hand that wrote them
    was gone.


    That evening, Sarah discovered the small altar in the back room. Incense, a photograph,
    white flowers carefully arranged. The jesa her father performed alone, keeping
    vigil over memory.


    "Dad, you can honor her anywhere."


    "Not anywhere." He touched the frame. "Here."


    On Thursday, the restaurant filled with people seeking one last meal. Word had
    spread through the neighborhood like smoke. David worked the kitchen while Sarah
    helped serve, and for brief moments, they moved in sync.


    A young couple sat at the corner table—the one where David had proposed three
    decades ago. They called him over, grinning, showing him a ring box. Sarah watched
    her father freeze, his face going pale. She stepped in quietly, guiding him back
    to the kitchen.


    "The japchae," he whispered. "I can''t remember her exact technique for the noodles."


    For the first time, his hands shook. Sarah took them in hers.


    "Then we''ll make it together," she said. "Show me. Tell me about her."


    They cooked side by side, his memory supported by her presence, and when the dish
    emerged—glossy noodles glistening with sesame oil—David felt something crack open
    in his chest.


    Friday morning, David made only one cup of coffee. He sat alone in the dining
    room with his wife''s recipe book and did something he hadn''t done since the
    funeral: he changed a recipe. He took her traditional doenjang jjigae and added
    the miso paste Sarah had suggested, created something new from something old.
    When he tasted it, tears finally came—three years of salt and sorrow.


    Sarah found him there and simply sat down across from him, waiting.


    "I''m sorry I missed your wedding," he said finally.


    "I''m sorry I didn''t fight harder to get you there."


    On Sunday, their last day, David and Sarah arrived together at dawn. He performed
    the jesa one final time, but this time Sarah knelt beside him. They bowed to her
    mother''s photograph together. Sarah placed her wedding photo on the altar—a retroactive
    blessing.


    As they packed, Sarah asked about the corner table.


    "Let it stay," David said. "Maybe someone else falls in love there."


    Outside, Mrs. Chen waited as the demolition fence went up. "The building goes,"
    she said. "We stay."


    David looked at Sarah, at the recipe book in his hands, at the photo she carried.


    "Come to California," Sarah said. "Just for a month. Visit. We''ll cook together."


    "One month," David agreed. "Then we''ll see."


    They walked away as the city continued its relentless forward motion around them—two
    people carrying memories forward into an uncertain tomorrow, which was, perhaps,
    the only way grief ever really moved at all.'
