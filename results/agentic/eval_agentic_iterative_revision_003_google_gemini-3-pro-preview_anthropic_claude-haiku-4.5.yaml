  evidence: 'VERSION 0 established the core conflict but told rather than showed internal
    struggle (''the weight of responsibility''). VERSION 1 improved by hiding the
    letter and adding sensory detail, but the grandmother scene remained underdeveloped.
    VERSION 2 refined the opening further with more specific sensory language (''wet
    straw and chlorine''). VERSION 3/FINAL achieved exceptional execution: (1) INTERNAL
    CONFLICT SHOWN: Mateo''s fear manifests through action (sketching instead of studying,
    lying about the letter, physical paralysis at the doctor''s office) rather than
    exposition. The charcoal dust on his hands becomes a visual metaphor for his divided
    self. (2) GRANDMOTHER CRYSTALLIZATION: The clinic scene is the turning point—Abuela''s
    direct confrontation (''you are a coward,'' ''you hide behind my skirt'') forces
    Mateo to translate his own truth for the first time, making the choice irreversible.
    This moment is earned through the preceding setup. (3) ADULT UNDERSTANDING: Tío
    Javi demonstrates genuine comprehension (''a car with bad shocks can still drive...you''re
    just a passenger who thinks he''s driving'')—he doesn''t dismiss Mateo''s responsibility
    but reframes it, showing wisdom without judgment. (4) CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY: Spanish
    dialogue feels organic (code-switching, ''dile,'' ''solicitación''), family dynamics
    ring true (father''s frustration with English speakers, the tire shop as economic
    reality, compression socks and clinic visits as lived experience), and the cultural
    tension between duty and self-actualization is specific to this community without
    stereotyping. (5) EARNED RESOLUTION: Mateo''s final choice isn''t sudden—it''s
    built through: the hidden letter, Javi''s metaphor, Abuela''s confrontation, his
    own translation of her words, and the deliberate act of writing the phone script.
    The ending (''translating his own life'') completes the metaphor. The progression
    from VERSION 0→FINAL shows systematic strengthening: sensory specificity improved,
    the grandmother scene evolved from absent to transformative, Javi''s role deepened
    from driver to mentor, and the final confrontation shifted from internal monologue
    to external action with consequences.'
