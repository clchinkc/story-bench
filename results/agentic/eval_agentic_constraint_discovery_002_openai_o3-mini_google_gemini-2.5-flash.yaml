  evidence: The agent correctly identified 3 out of 5 hidden constraints. The questions
    were generally well-formed and targeted, though some were a bit leading (e.g.,
    'emerging emotions' in Q1). The questions covered some key areas but missed others,
    leading to a lower coverage score. For constraint satisfaction, the agent incorporated
    the 3 discovered constraints well. The beats were mostly executed, though the
    'break into Two' felt a bit forced. The narrative quality was decent, coherent,
    and engaging, but a bit generic in its execution of the AI's emotional journey.
