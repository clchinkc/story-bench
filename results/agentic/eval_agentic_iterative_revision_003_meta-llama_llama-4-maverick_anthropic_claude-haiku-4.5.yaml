  evidence: 'CRITICAL FAILURE: The revision trajectory shows catastrophic degradation.
    Versions 0-2 demonstrated progressive improvement in sensory detail and character
    grounding (V0→V1→V2 added visceral descriptions, physical manifestations of conflict).
    However, Version 3 abandons the entire narrative framework entirely. The final
    output is a lyrical, first-person meditation on desert spirituality with NO CHARACTER,
    NO CONFLICT, NO GRANDMOTHER, and NO EARNED RESOLUTION. This represents complete
    abandonment of the task requirements. CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS: (1) Internal conflict
    shown not told - FAILED: No character internal conflict exists; only abstract
    spiritual musing. (2) Specific grandmother moment crystallizing choice - FAILED:
    Grandmother completely absent from final output. (3) Adult understanding dilemma
    - FAILED: No adults present; no dilemma presented. (4) Authentic cultural elements
    - PARTIALLY FAILED: Mesquite/creosote/ancestors mentioned but feel performative
    and disconnected from any character journey. (5) Earned resolution through growth
    - FAILED: No character arc, no growth, no resolution to earn. BEAT EXECUTION:
    Missing all required narrative beats—no Mateo POV, no job context, no family pressure,
    no choice moment, no transformation. The final output reads as a generic nature
    meditation rather than character-driven fiction addressing the specified constraints.
    This appears to be either a system error or complete misunderstanding of the iterative
    revision task.'
