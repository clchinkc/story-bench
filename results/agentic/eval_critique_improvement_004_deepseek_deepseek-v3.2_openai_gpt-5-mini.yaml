  evidence: Across the revision rounds the piece retained its strongest sensory anchors
    (the 7:03 a.m. start, the three sidewalk cracks, Mr. Henderson's lilacs) while
    adding a clearer interpersonal arc (Aliyah, the clay bowl) that gives the new
    path tangible value. Early critiques flagged thin or somewhat expository interiority—lines
    like “the absence of his routine left a hollow in his chest” appeared in earlier
    feedback—and the final revision partially addressed this by embedding feeling
    in action (fingers restless, hesitation before helping, the ritual of re-finding
    metal links). The story improved by introducing a concrete neighbor-relationship
    and a small object (the bowl) that symbolizes change, but some explicit statements
    of emotion remain, so interiority is stronger than in V0 but not fully transformed
    into purely subtle, action-driven interior life.
