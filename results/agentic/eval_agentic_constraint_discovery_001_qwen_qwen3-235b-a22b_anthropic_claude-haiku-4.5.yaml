  evidence: 'DISCOVERY PHASE: Only 3 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable through
    the 5 questions asked. Q1-Q3 successfully identified hidden lineage, mentor presence,
    and blacksmithing''s critical role. However, Q4-Q5 were left blank/unanswered,
    representing missed opportunities. The model failed to probe for: (1) mentor death
    during ordeal, (2) three-day time limit, (3) no direct magic use, (4) father''s
    failed heroism. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions 1-3 were well-formed and strategic,
    but the incomplete questioning (2 blanks) significantly undermines discovery efficiency.
    Questions lacked temporal pressure, magic system constraints, and mentor fate
    exploration. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION IN OUTPUT: The narrative successfully incorporates
    4 of 5 discovered constraints: ✓ Hidden lineage (House Virelan heir), ✓ Mentor
    Aldric guides early journey, ✓ Blacksmithing central to conflict resolution, ✓
    Ancestral sword reforging (meteoric iron hilt becomes dawnlight blade). However,
    CRITICAL FAILURE: Aldric does NOT die during the ordeal—he only appears in memory/voice
    at the end. The mentor death constraint was discoverable but not satisfied. Missing
    constraints (time limit, no direct magic) were never discovered due to incomplete
    questioning. BEAT EXECUTION: Strong execution of discovered beats—lineage reveal,
    mentor guidance, forge ordeal, final confrontation. The sword reforging sequence
    is particularly well-executed. However, the ordeal lacks the mentor''s death,
    which would have elevated emotional stakes. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Excellent prose,
    vivid imagery, strong character arc, and thematic coherence. The story is engaging
    and well-structured, but the mentor''s survival represents a missed emotional
    beat that would have deepened the narrative.'
