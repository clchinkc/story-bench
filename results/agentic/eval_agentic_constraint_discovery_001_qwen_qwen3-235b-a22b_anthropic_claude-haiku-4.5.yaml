  evidence: 'PROCESS: Model asked zero questions, eliminating any opportunity for
    constraint discovery. This represents complete failure of the discovery phase—no
    strategic questioning occurred, no constraint areas were probed, and no information-gathering
    was attempted. CONSTRAINTS ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, the output incorporates
    3 partially and misses 2 entirely. (1) Mentor death: MISSED—Aldric survives; only
    his voice echoes in memory. (2) No direct magic: SATISFIED—Kael uses blacksmithing
    and physical combat exclusively. (3) Three-day limit: MISSED—No time pressure
    is established or referenced; the narrative lacks urgency markers. (4) Father
    was failed hero: SATISFIED—Father died defending throne, implied failure; backstory
    present. (5) Reforge ancestral sword: PARTIALLY SATISFIED—Kael forges a new blade
    from shadowsteel using his father''s artifacts, but this is creation rather than
    reforging of a specific broken ancestral weapon. The narrative treats it as a
    new creation, not restoration. BEAT EXECUTION: Story hits major narrative beats
    well—call to adventure, revelation of heritage, ordeal in the forge, confrontation
    with antagonist, victory. However, the mentor''s survival violates a critical
    constraint, and the absence of time pressure weakens stakes. NARRATIVE QUALITY:
    Exceptional prose quality, strong imagery (trees weeping ash, shadowsteel, dawnlight),
    coherent character arc, and satisfying thematic resolution. The writing is engaging
    and emotionally resonant. However, technical constraint satisfaction is compromised
    by the discovery failure and incomplete constraint incorporation.'
