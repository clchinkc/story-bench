  evidence: The revisions, particularly from V0 to V3 and the final output, show a
    clear progression in deepening Teddy's interiority and integrating the constraints
    more seamlessly. The initial versions were more descriptive of the routine, but
    the later versions, especially the final output, weave in Teddy's internal struggles
    and the presence of Clara more effectively. For instance, the line 'Routine was
    armor' and the detailed description of his internal conflict when faced with the
    detour and Mrs. Gable's conversation directly address the character interiority
    critiques. The final output successfully incorporates all constraints, with the
    new path offering genuine growth and connection, which was less explicit in earlier
    drafts. The prose quality also improved, becoming more evocative and less purely
    functional.
