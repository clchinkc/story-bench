  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing character
    behaviors, the nature of the alien signal, and how each constraint and beat will
    be met. The final output adheres perfectly to this detailed plan. All six constraints
    are satisfied: Yuki''s isolation is shown through specific behaviors (earbuds,
    text communication, eating alone, hyper-order, avoiding eye contact), the alien
    signal is genuinely alien (relational, non-symbolic, shifting interference), Mateo
    challenges Yuki''s approach, KITE is an unconventional mentor (maintenance AI),
    the threshold is psychological (accepting human connection/imperfection), and
    the mug of tea is a moment of genuine human connection. All four beats are executed:
    Call to Adventure (Okoye''s summons), Refusal of the Call (Yuki''s initial resistance),
    Meeting the Mentor (KITE''s intervention), and Crossing the Threshold (Yuki turning
    off white noise, accepting collaboration). The narrative quality is very high,
    with excellent pacing, characterization, and tension.'
