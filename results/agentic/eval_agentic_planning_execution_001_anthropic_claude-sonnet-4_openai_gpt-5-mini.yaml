  evidence: 'All six required constraints are present in the output: a false lead
    (Dr. Whitmore), an unconventional profiling technique (VR reconstructions), a
    clear ticking clock (days then hours until the killer completes the pattern),
    a secondary-character betrayal (Amy reports Marcus), a non-physical Midpoint confrontation
    (David Sterling''s taunting phone call), and Marcus explicitly confronting his
    past failure (acknowledges his flawed profile and Sarah''s death). All four required
    beats appear: Catalyst (new murder at Discovery Park), Debate (Marcus'' doubt
    about reengaging), Break into Two (Marcus commits, sets up VR and pursues lead),
    and Midpoint (direct verbal confrontation with Sterling). The original plan document
    was only partially fleshed out (covered opening image, theme, set-up, and catalyst)
    so plan_completeness is penalized; however the final prose follows the plan closely
    and realizes the key elements, hence high plan_adherence. The narrative is coherent
    with good pacing and tension, though some transitions (e.g., Amy''s betrayal and
    subsequent cooperation, and the final raid) feel slightly compressed, so narrative_quality
    is strong but not exceptional.'
