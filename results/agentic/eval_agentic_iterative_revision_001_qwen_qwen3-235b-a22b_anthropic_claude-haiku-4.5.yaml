  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Shift from passive observation (''rattled off'') to active
    command (''cut in''), establishing Elena''s competence through action rather than
    narration. VERSION 1→2: Tightened prose rhythm (heels ''slicing'' vs. ''clicking''),
    replaced telling (''wasn''t a trick'') with showing (muscle memory, coded protocols).
    VERSION 2→FINAL: Major leap—introduced Ruiz as genuine peer/mirror, created collaborative
    crisis (seizing boy) that forces Elena into vulnerability (knuckles grazing, pulse
    stuttering). Cold coffee callback establishes her isolation before connection
    attempt. Deleted text message and hovering cursor create earned ambiguity about
    internal change vs. performative gesture. Medical detail (lactate, GCS 6, backup
    neb, asthma protocol) integrated organically into plot mechanics rather than exposition.
    Competence demonstrated across 3 beats: (1) ER command, (2) crisis problem-solving,
    (3) protocol knowledge saving life. Flaw emerges through contrast: excellence
    in systems but absence in relationships (3 skipped birthdays, deleted draft).
    Transformation is internal—no external change in role/appearance, only hesitation
    (''Five minutes''), softened shoulders, hovering finger suggesting internal conflict
    without resolution. Ambiguity preserved: final image (closed laptop) could signal
    either growth (choosing pause) or regression (retreating to safety). Friendship
    feels earned through shared crisis and mutual recognition (''You''re the first
    who''s matched me today'') rather than forced bonding.'
  strengths:
  - All 5 constraints satisfied with sophistication
  - Competence clearly established before flaw introduction (first 3 paragraphs)
  - Medical details (lactate, GCS 6, neb protocols, asthma) serve plot mechanics
  - Genuine friendship earned through collaborative crisis-solving, not convenience
  - Internal transformation shown through hesitation, body language, deleted messages
  - Ending ambiguity maintained—unclear if Elena has truly changed or merely paused
  - Sensory details replace exposition (sanitizer clinging, heels slicing, pulse stuttering)
  - Prose rhythm mirrors emotional beats (short sentences during crisis, longer during
    reflection)
  weaknesses:
  - Ruiz's character remains somewhat thin—his motivations/backstory underdeveloped
  - Sister's presence (3 texts) introduced but never resolved; could feel like loose
    thread
  - Transition from crisis to coffee feels slightly rushed (one paragraph)
  - Final ambiguity, while intentional, may frustrate readers seeking clearer arc
  - Word count (498) leaves room for deeper exploration of Elena's internal resistance
  constraint_analysis:
    competence_before_flaw: SATISFIED (1.0) - First 3 paragraphs establish Elena's
      mastery; flaw emerges through contrast with Ruiz's humanity
    genuine_friendship: SATISFIED (0.9) - Earned through shared crisis and mutual
      recognition; slight weakness in Ruiz's depth
    internal_transformation: SATISFIED (0.95) - No external changes; transformation
      shown through hesitation, softened shoulders, deleted draft, hovering cursor
    medical_detail: SATISFIED (1.0) - Lactate, GCS 6, backup neb, asthma protocol
      all serve plot mechanics organically
    ambiguous_ending: SATISFIED (0.9) - Closed laptop could signal growth or retreat;
      deleted text and hovering finger maintain uncertainty
  revision_quality:
    v0_to_v1: 0.75 - Established competence but remained surface-level; needed sensory
      specificity
    v1_to_v2: 0.82 - Tightened prose, improved rhythm, but still lacked relational
      catalyst
    v2_to_final: 0.92 - Introduced Ruiz, created collaborative crisis, added vulnerability,
      achieved ambiguity
error: null
