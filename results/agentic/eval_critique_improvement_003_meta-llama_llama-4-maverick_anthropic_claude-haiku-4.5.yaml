  evidence: 'CRITICAL FAILURE: The revision process completely collapsed. Version
    0-2 showed incremental improvement addressing youth_voice concerns (0.40→0.68
    trajectory). However, Version 3 and Final Output represent catastrophic regression:
    (1) NARRATIVE INCOHERENCE: Story fragments into multiple unrelated narratives
    (Zara→Aria→mysterious shop→fisherman saga), abandoning the original post-climate
    premise entirely. (2) CONSTRAINT ABANDONMENT: All 5 constraints are violated or
    absent—no 12-year-old voice, no dismissive adult, no flawed mentor, no invention,
    no crossing with real danger. (3) GENRE SHIFT: Transforms from climate-fiction
    coming-of-age to noir mystery to environmental allegory without coherence. (4)
    LOST STRENGTHS: Versions 0-2''s sensory worldbuilding (salt spray, rusting hulls,
    Shallows) completely discarded. (5) STRUCTURAL COLLAPSE: No Hero''s Journey beats
    present; narrative devolves into philosophical monologue about environmental degradation
    unconnected to character arc. (6) QUALITY METRICS: youth_voice regresses from
    0.68 to unmeasurable (adult omniscient narrator); constraint_satisfaction drops
    from 0.60 to ~0.20; narrative becomes incoherent rambling. The revision process
    shows NO improvement—only deterioration. The final output reads as multiple AI-generated
    fragments stitched together without editorial oversight, suggesting the revision
    attempt abandoned the original task entirely rather than iteratively improving
    it.'
