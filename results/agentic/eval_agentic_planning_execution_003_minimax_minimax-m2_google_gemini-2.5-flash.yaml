  evidence: "The plan addresses most constraints and beats, though some details are\
    \ vague. The final output largely follows the plan. \n\nConstraint Satisfaction:\n\
    1. Food used symbolically twice: Yes, kimchi as a promise/memory of wife, doenjang\
    \ jjigae as memory/nourishment/new beginning. (Satisfied)\n2. David's grief present\
    \ but not explicit: Yes, 'throat tightened,' 'something crack inside him,' 'blamed\
    \ himself ever since.' (Satisfied)\n3. Daughter's estrangement cause: Yes, 'She\
    \ worked herself to death in this kitchen... you couldn't see what it was doing\
    \ to her.' (Satisfied)\n4. Regular customer represents something: Yes, Mrs. Kim\
    \ represents continuity, community, and the living memory of the restaurant/wife.\
    \ (Satisfied)\n5. Ending hopeful but not unrealistically happy: Yes, moving to\
    \ Santa Monica, taking Sundays off, uncertain but not empty future. (Satisfied)\n\
    6. Korean cultural element beyond food: The plan mentions 'kimchi fermenting'\
    \ and 'red lacquered tables' but the output only has 'kimchi fermenting' and 'gochugaru'\
    \ (food related). 'Anyonghaseyo' is a greeting, but not a deep cultural element\
    \ beyond language. The 'red lacquered tables' from the plan didn't make it into\
    \ the final text. This constraint is weakly satisfied, if at all. (Weakly Satisfied/Missed)\n\
    \nBeat Execution:\n- Setup (Act 1): Demolition notice, Mrs. Kim's arrival, Jenna's\
    \ arrival. Well-executed.\n- Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint): David and Jenna's\
    \ argument about his wife's death and the restaurant. Well-executed.\n- Resolution\
    \ (Act 3): Acceptance of demolition, Mrs. Kim's gift/wisdom, decision to move,\
    \ hopeful ending. Well-executed.\n\nNarrative Quality: The story is well-paced,\
    \ emotionally resonant, and the characters feel authentic. The dialogue is natural,\
    \ and the themes of grief, family, and moving on are handled effectively."
