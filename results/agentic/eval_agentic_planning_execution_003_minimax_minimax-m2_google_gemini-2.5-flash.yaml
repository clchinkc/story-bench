  evidence: 'The plan was very comprehensive and detailed, covering all constraints
    and beats with specific ideas. The final output followed the plan closely, only
    deviating slightly in the exact wording of some dialogue and the specific food
    symbolism used for the confrontation. All constraints were met: food symbolism
    (kimchi as preservation, cabbage as struggle, dumplings as shared learning), David''s
    grief (setting a place for his wife, holding recipe cards, ''all he has left''),
    daughter''s estrangement (missed graduation due to restaurant emergency), regular
    customer (Mrs. Chen representing continuity/tradition), hopeful but not unrealistically
    happy ending (restaurant sold but traditions continue, cookbook with daughter),
    and Korean cultural element (barley tea, hanbok story, kimchi, dumplings). All
    three beats (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution) were clearly executed. The narrative
    quality was strong, with good pacing and emotional depth.'
