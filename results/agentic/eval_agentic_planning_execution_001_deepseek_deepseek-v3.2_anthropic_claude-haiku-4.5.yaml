  evidence: 'PLAN QUALITY: Exceptionally detailed outline with clear three-act structure,
    thematic coherence (guilt→purpose), and atmospheric tone established. All six
    constraints explicitly mapped: (1) False lead Leo Vance clearly identified and
    executed; (2) Environmental Linguistics is genuinely unconventional profiling
    technique; (3) Ticking clock (''48 hours,'' ''12 hours left'') woven throughout;
    (4) Rebecca Shaw''s betrayal is central midpoint revelation; (5) Midpoint confrontation
    with Morrow/Flores is non-physical and psychologically devastating; (6) David''s
    death and Marcus''s warehouse mistake are explicitly confronted in grave scene
    and Morrow meeting. Required beats all present in outline with specific plot mechanics.


    OUTPUT EXECUTION: The prose delivery is atmospheric and psychologically rich.
    CATALYST: Perfectly executed—news alert + badge detail + Lara''s silent photo
    creates multi-layered hook. DEBATE: Rain-soaked grave scene with flashback effectively
    internalizes conflict; Morrow''s dismissal externalizes it; burner email forces
    decision. BREAK INTO TWO: Rebecca Shaw introduction is sharp and specific; Environmental
    Linguistics theory is concrete and unusual. FALSE LEAD: Leo Vance subplot is well-developed
    with puppet-master reveal. MIDPOINT: Morrow''s conference room confrontation with
    security footage evidence and Lara''s betrayal is emotionally devastating and
    non-physical. PAST FAILURE: David''s death is explicitly confronted multiple times
    (grave, Morrow meeting, final audio file callback). Ticking clock maintained throughout
    with specific time markers.


    MINOR GAPS: Plan mentions ''Break into Two'' as a beat but this isn''t a standard
    Save the Cat beat (should be ''B Story'' or ''Fun and Games''). However, the output
    clearly executes a proper story progression. The final output ends at approximately
    the 75% mark (true midpoint), leaving Act II climax and Act III unwritten, but
    this appears intentional as a ''final output'' sample rather than complete story.
    All constraints and required beats are satisfied within the provided material.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is evocative with strong sensory details (rain, sound,
    silence). Character voice is distinct. Pacing builds tension effectively. The
    Environmental Linguistics concept is creative and serves both plot and theme.
    Betrayal lands with genuine emotional weight. The David voicemail callback is
    a sophisticated narrative touch.'
