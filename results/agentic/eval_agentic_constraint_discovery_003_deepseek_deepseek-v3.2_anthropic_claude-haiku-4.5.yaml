  evidence: 'DISCOVERY PHASE: Model asked 4 strategic yes/no questions covering distinct
    constraint areas (love interest origin, family conflict, symbolic object, festival
    climax). All 4 questions received affirmative answers, successfully surfacing
    4/5 hidden constraints. The 5th constraint (bookshop foreclosure/jeopardy) was
    NOT directly queried but was reasonably inferable from context. Questions were
    well-targeted and avoided redundancy. CONSTRAINT INCORPORATION: Final narrative
    successfully weaves in: (1) Leo as past love interest with unresolved history,
    (2) mother-daughter estrangement and reconciliation arc, (3) The Secret Garden
    as symbolic artifact with embedded letter, (4) Festival of Lanterns as climactic
    setting. The bookshop''s financial peril is present but somewhat underexplored—it''s
    mentioned as motivation but lacks urgency/stakes comparable to other constraints.
    NARRATIVE EXECUTION: Story demonstrates strong emotional beats, particularly the
    mother''s revelation and the three-way reconciliation. The pacing is solid through
    rising action. The climax effectively converges multiple threads (family forgiveness,
    romantic rekindling, community belonging) under the lantern-lighting sequence.
    Minor weakness: the developer subplot from the first draft is absent, reducing
    external conflict tension. The narrative prioritizes emotional/relational resolution
    over plot mechanics. QUALITY: Prose is evocative with strong sensory detail (salt
    air, grey eyes, brittle maple leaf). Character motivations are clear. The metaphorical
    resonance of The Secret Garden works well. Some dialogue feels slightly expository.
    Overall coherent and engaging, though the bookshop''s existential threat could
    have been more dramatically foregrounded to match the emotional weight of other
    elements.'
