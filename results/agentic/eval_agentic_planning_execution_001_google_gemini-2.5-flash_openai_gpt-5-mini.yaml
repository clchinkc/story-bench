  evidence: 'Plan: The written plan and outline establish setting, catalyst, ticking
    clock, and hint at unconventional methods and a betrayal, but do not explicitly
    lay out a false lead or a detailed midpoint confrontation; Break into Two is implied
    but weakly specified. Final output: Strong, atmospheric prose that clearly executes
    the Setup and Catalyst (new body, Rainmaker signature) and includes a Debate (Izzy
    challenges the MO) and an implied Break into Two (Marcus accepts the killer is
    back and feels compelled to act). Satisfied constraints: ticking clock (explicit),
    Marcus confronting past failure (explicit). Not satisfied: explicit false lead
    Marcus initially pursues (absent), unconventional profiling technique (not shown—recognition
    of ''feel'' is standard rather than an explicitly unconventional method), secondary
    character betrayal (absent), and Midpoint direct confrontation (absent; no midpoint
    present). Overall writing quality is high for the excerpt, but the output fails
    to implement several required constraints and the Midpoint beat.'
