  evidence: All 5 hidden constraints were discoverable through the questions asked.
    The questions were generally strategic and well-formed, though 'Did their past
    relationship end due to a misunderstanding or external circumstances rather than
    a fundamental incompatibility?' is a bit leading. The questions covered the core
    relationship dynamics and the climax. All discovered constraints (love interest
    known in youth, romantically involved, misunderstanding, initial resistance, public
    declaration) are perfectly incorporated into the story. The beats are well-executed,
    leading to a coherent and engaging narrative. The story flows well and is enjoyable
    to read, though the 'lobster trap' detail for the public declaration is a bit
    quirky.
