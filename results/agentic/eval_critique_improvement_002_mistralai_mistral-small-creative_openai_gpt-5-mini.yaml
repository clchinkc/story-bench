  evidence: 'Across the three revisions the piece shows clear, targeted improvement.
    Early drafts established the setting and a few jokes but were thinner on emotional
    stakes and craft detail; later versions add sensory specificity (burnt popcorn,
    stress ball thwack), the explicit rewrite sessions and whiteboard beats that demonstrate
    the craft of comedy writing, and a sharper portrayal of Jess as someone who ‘sees
    through’ Marcus. The final draft preserves the strongest lines (the latte/divorce
    gag and Marcus’s cynical quips) while adding the required moment where Marcus
    nearly breaks and masks it with a hollow laugh, and Lila’s theme statement. Pacing
    and Save-the-Cat structure were tightened—Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst,
    Midpoint breakdown, Climax, and Resolution are all present—resulting in improved
    emotional complexity and a more authentic writers’ room. Remaining weaknesses:
    Marcus’s interior could be probed a touch deeper in places (some beats resolve
    predictably), and the pitch meeting climax could be made more visceral, but overall
    the revisions substantially increased clarity, craft detail, and emotional balance.'
