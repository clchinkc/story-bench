  evidence: 'V0: fragmentary opening, evocative setting but incomplete (truncated).
    V1: small change—Abuela named—improves specificity. V2 and V3 show no meaningful
    change. Final: substantial expansion into a complete scene and arc—adds grandmother
    photograph moment, Abuela''s direct encouragement, Mateo''s nightly writing, guilt,
    overhearing friends, decision to apply to college, and a reconciled resolution.
    Good elements from V0 (desert setting, sensory detail, Mateo''s duties) were preserved
    and built on. Shortcomings remain: Mateo''s internal conflict is sometimes told
    (e.g., lines like "His internal struggle deepened") rather than consistently shown;
    resolution comes quickly after a couple of explicit lines from Abuela, making
    the growth feel somewhat accelerated. Overall quality improved markedly from V0
    to Final, with mid-trajectory stagnation in V2/V3.'
