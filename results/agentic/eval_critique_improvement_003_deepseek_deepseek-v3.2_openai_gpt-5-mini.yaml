  evidence: 'Version 0 established setting and Zara but was more generic. By Version
    1–3 the author tightened voice, added a concrete invention (the algae-based water
    filter) and made the archive map the clear call to action. Finn''s specific flaw
    (loss of daughter Marin and consequent closed-off courage) was introduced in the
    final revision, converting him from a background elder to a flawed mentor. The
    crossing was escalated from implied risk to a tangible, visceral danger: a cross-current,
    a jagged spar, and a moment where Zara improvises by throwing her filter overboard
    to act as an anchor—demonstrating competence without magic. Youthful diction and
    sensory details were preserved and refined (boot-thump rhythm, smells), improving
    authenticity while keeping prior strengths. Remaining minor issues: a few lines
    still verge toward polished adult phrasing, but overall voice, stakes, and worldbuilding
    show clear, disciplined improvement across revisions.'
