  evidence: 'VERSION 0 establishes Elena''s competence through rapid-fire ER decisions
    (stat labs, CT approval, conflict resolution) with economical prose. VERSION 1
    adds psychological depth (''hollow ache gnawing her ribs'') while maintaining
    clinical authority—the competence-before-flaw structure emerges. VERSION 3 tightens
    language further (''efficiency was her armor; the hospital, her fortress'') and
    introduces the specific medical detail (SpO2: 82%, danger zone) that becomes narratively
    crucial. FINAL OUTPUT executes all constraints: (1) Competence shown first through
    precise ER management and protocol knowledge; (2) Friendship earned through Arthur''s
    vulnerability and Elena''s genuine hesitation—the stool-pulling, mask-offering,
    shared confessions feel hard-won, not sentimental; (3) Transformation is internal
    (''the ache remained, but beneath it pulsed something new'')—no external change
    in role/appearance; (4) SpO2 saturation detail serves plot mechanics (justifies
    her intervention, marks the turning point); (5) Ending ambiguity is masterful—''Had
    she merely glimpsed the loneliness through a crack? Or had the crack widened?''
    followed by the hesitation at the door handle leaves her trajectory genuinely
    uncertain. The revision trajectory shows progressive refinement: V0→V1 adds emotional
    subtext; V1→V3 strips excess while deepening specificity; Final version integrates
    all elements cohesively. The Arthur Henderson encounter is the emotional fulcrum—his
    ''Never good at waiting'' mirrors Elena''s avoidance, creating genuine reciprocal
    recognition rather than patronizing rescue. Minor weakness: the apartment phone
    callback feels slightly telegraphed, though it serves thematic closure. Prose
    quality improves through each revision via tighter syntax and stronger sensory
    detail (acrid scent of infection, gnarled hand, hiss of oxygen).'
