    STORY THEORY: Hero''s Journey


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Zara, a 12-year-old girl growing up in a post-climate-change coastal
    city

    where most adults have given up hope. She builds things from salvage and

    believes solutions exist if people would just look for them.


    - Setting: New Boston, 2089. A city of floating platforms, recycled materials,
    and

    perpetual sea spray. What was once downtown is now called the Shallows.


    - Central conflict: When Zara discovers the location of a pre-flood archive containing
    lost

    environmental technology, she must convince cynical adults to help her

    retrieve it before a storm erases it forever.


    - Tone: Hopeful but not naive, kinetic, youth-centered


    REQUIRED BEATS: Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing
    the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Zara must be competent without being unrealistically capable

    - At least one adult must initially dismiss her as ''just a kid''

    - The mentor figure must be flawed in a specific way

    - Include one invention of Zara''s that demonstrates her ingenuity

    - The crossing must involve real danger, not token obstacles


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - youth_voice: Does Zara sound authentically 12, not adult-in-miniature?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Hero''s Journey beats properly executed?

    - worldbuilding: Does the post-climate world feel vivid and consistent?

    - hope_balance: Is hope present without becoming saccharine?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

    \  \n\n**Call to Adventure**  \nThat afternoon, while diving in the Shallows for\
    \ parts, Zara spotted a glint beneath a collapsed office tower. Squeezing through\

    \ \"Adults don't chase fairy tales.\"  \nZara slammed the crystal drive on his\
    \ bench. \"My purifier works because I *looked*! You taught me that!\"  \nFinn\
    \ froze. His eyes flickered to a faded photo—a girl Zara's age, lost in the same\
    \ storm that took his leg. \"Even if... salvage teams need permits. Resources.\"\
    \  \n\"You have the *Cormorant*!\" Zara pointed at his submersible dinghy, half-buried\
    \ under tarps. \"And I mapped the Shallows' currents last month!\"  \nFinn's knuckles\
    \ whitened on the wrench. \"Too dangerous. I won't... can't lose...\" The unspoken\

    \ and over the rebar, slamming down hard but clear.  \nBreathless, soaked, they\

    \  \n\n**Call to Adventure**  \nThat afternoon, while diving in the Shallows for\
    \ parts, Zara spotted a glint beneath a collapsed office tower. Squeezing through\
    \ corroded beams, she found a sealed archive pod—Pre-Flood Emergency Conservation\
    \ Corps logo still visible. Inside, a crystal drive glowed with a hologram: trees\
    \ sprouting from cracked concrete and coral bursting with color. Words flashed:\
    \ *RE-GREENING PROJECT: SAVE OUR SKY AND SEAS*. Below, a map blinked at Harbor\
    \ Point—right where the library ruins sank!  \nHer breath caught. The big storm\
    \ surge was due tomorrow.  \n\n**Meeting the Mentor**  \nOld Man Finn's workshop\
    \ smelled of solder and defeat. Once the city's chief engineer, he now repaired\
    \ fishing bots, his left leg a jerry-rigged prosthetic after the '75 platform\
    \ collapse killed his crew.  \n\"Library basement?\" He snorted, not looking up\
    \ from his workbench. \"That's thirty meters down in collapsed ruins. With a Category\
    \ Four brewing.\"  \n\"But the *tech*—\"  \n\"Got real work, kid.\" He waved a\
    \ wrench dismissively. \"Adults don't chase fairy tales.\"  \nZara slammed the\
    \ crystal drive on his bench. \"My purifier works because I *looked*! You taught\
    \ me that!\"  \nFinn froze. His eyes flickered to a faded photo—a girl Zara's\
    \ age, lost in the same storm that took his leg. \"Even if... salvage teams need\
    \ permits. Resources.\"  \n\"You have the *Cormorant*!\" Zara pointed at his submersible\
    \ dinghy, half-buried under tarps. \"And I mapped the Shallows' currents last\
    \ month!\"  \nFinn's knuckles whitened on the wrench. \"Too dangerous. I won't...\
    \ can't lose...\" The unspoken *another child* hung salt-thick in the air.  \n\
    \n**Crossing the Threshold**  \nAt dawn, the *Cormorant* sliced through chop the\
    \ color of bruised fruit. Zara gripped her patched depth-suit as Finn navigated\
    \ wreckage-choked channels.  \nFinn tapped the shuddering viewport. \"Seals could\
    \ blow at any minute.\"  \nZara's stomach flipped. \"But... but they might hold?\"\
    \  \n\"Maybe.\" Finn's jaw tightened. \"That drive might be fried too.\"  \n\"\
    But it might *not*.\" Zara watched New Boston shrink behind them—a raft city huddled\
    \ under storm clouds.  \nNear Harbor Point, the sea boiled. A collapsing skyscraper\
    \ groaned, spewing debris. Finn cursed, wrenching the wheel. \"Current's shifting!\
    \ Hold—\"  \nCRUNCH! A refrigerator-sized chunk of concrete smashed into the stern.\
    \ The *Cormorant* lurched, throwing Zara against the console. Cold seawater sprayed\
    \ through a cracked viewport—right onto her face!  \n\"Bail!\" Finn shoved a bucket\
    \ at her as the dinghy spun toward jagged rebar teeth.  \nZara scrambled, scooping\
    \ water with trembling hands. Her purifier—strapped to her pack—hummed weakly\
    \ nearby. Useless against this! Rust-water filled her nose, panic clawing her\
    \ throat.  \nFinn jammed the thrusters full reverse. \"Can't... hold...\"  \n\
    Grabbing a salvage hook, Zara stabbed it into the console. \"Left! Go left with\
    \ the wave!\"  \nFinn hesitated—then spun the wheel. The *Cormorant* rode the\
    \ churning water up and over the rebar, slamming down hard but clear.  \nBreathless\
    \ and dripping, they stared at the Library's submerged entrance—a dark maw flanked\
    \ by broken stone lions.  \nFinn wiped seawater from his eyes. \"Still think hope's\
    \ weightless, kid?\"  \nZara adjusted her cracked dive helmet. \"Nope. But it\
    \ floats.\"  \nAs thunder cracked overhead, they plunged into the drowned library."
