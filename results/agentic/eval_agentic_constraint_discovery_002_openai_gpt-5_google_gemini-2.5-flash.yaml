  evidence: The questions successfully discovered 3 out of 5 constraints. 'Specific
    plot events or outcomes' covered the AI's choice, 'external signal or discovery'
    covered the Catalyst, and 'specific secondary character' covered Maru. The questions
    were generally well-formed and covered various aspects. The output incorporated
    the discovered constraints well, particularly the Catalyst and the interaction
    with Maru. The AI's choice is implied but not fully realized as a dilemma yet.
    The beats are clearly executed. The narrative quality is strong, engaging, and
    well-written.
