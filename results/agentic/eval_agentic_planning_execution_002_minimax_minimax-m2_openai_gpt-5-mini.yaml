  evidence: 'The plan explicitly covered all required constraints and beats (timestamps,
    behaviors, tuning fork, Antarctic setting, psychological threshold). The final
    output follows the plan closely: Call to Adventure at 03:47, clear Refusal (refusal
    email, remote analysis), Meeting the Mentor (Anya arriving, tuning fork, unconventional
    teaching), and Crossing the Threshold (Yuki''s internal choice to be vulnerable
    and upload her model). Isolation is shown through behaviors (declining ride-share,
    ''no-contact'' blocks, noise-cancelling headphones, eating alone). The signal
    reads as genuinely alien (hypercube tilings, pressure gradients, topological knots)
    rather than anthropomorphic. The colleague (Arjun) challenges her approach repeatedly.
    The mentor is unconventional in method and demeanor. The required surprising human
    connection occurs (Arjun bringing heated gloves / simple ''You''re cold''), which
    visibly affects Yuki. Minor notes: a few lines verge on telling (e.g., "The act
    felt like a threshold ritual," "The threshold wasn''t crossing a door"), which
    slightly reduces ''show vs tell,'' but these do not undermine overall execution.'
