  evidence: 'Plan: identified required beats and constraints but was truncated mid-sentence
    (incomplete). Specifics (03:12, Antarctica, Marcus, Elena, paintings) are present.
    Adherence: final story follows the plan closely. Constraints: all met except the
    ''alien signal not anthropomorphic'' requirement — the signal is vividly described
    but uses anthropomorphic/emotional language (''trying to breathe'', ''felt like
    grief''), which undermines the ''genuinely alien'' constraint. Isolation is shown
    via behaviors (low light, cleared history, white noise, avoiding callers). Mentor
    is unconventional (painter), colleague challenges Yuki (Marcus), Threshold is
    psychological (crossing via matching rhythm), and there is a surprising human
    connection (Elena covering Yuki''s hand).'
