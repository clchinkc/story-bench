    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

  content: 'The fog crept in like a damp mist, shrouding the small coastal town in
    a chill that seeped into Detective Sarah Chen''s bones. She stood on the edge
    of the water, the fog swirling around her ankles as she breathed in the salty
    air. The sound of the waves and the cry of gulls were the only sounds that broke
    the stillness.


    As she began to walk along the shore, the fog swirled around her, revealing glimpses
    of the town. Weathered lobster traps and rusty fishing gear lined the beach, while
    the skeletal remains of abandoned boats stood like sentinels against the fog.
    The air was thick with the smell of salt and seaweed.


    Sarah''s eyes scanned the horizon, her gaze lingering on the faint outline of
    a shipwreck in the distance. She knew that she was being watched, and the weight
    of that gaze made her skin prickle. As she walked, the fog swirled around her,
    tendrils curling around her ankles like cold fingers.


    The sound of a boat engine broke the stillness, and Sarah turned to see a small
    fishing vessel chugging into the harbor. The captain, a grizzled old man with
    a thick beard, eyed her warily as he tied up at the dock. Sarah watched as he
    expertly secured the boat, his movements practiced and economical.


    As the fog began to clear, Sarah spotted a figure on the dock, a woman with a
    notebook and pen, observing her. The woman''s eyes met Sarah''s, and for a moment,
    they simply looked at each other. Then, the woman nodded and turned back to her
    notebook, jotting down a few lines.


    Sarah''s gaze drifted back to the captain, who was now watching her with a mixture
    of curiosity and suspicion. She smiled wryly, knowing she had to tread carefully.
    The town was a complex web, and she was still unraveling the threads.


    As the day wore on, Sarah found herself back at the local café, sipping a cup
    of black coffee. The fog had rolled in again, shrouding the town in a damp mist.
    She pulled out her notebook and began to write, the scratch of her pen on the
    paper the only sound in the stillness.


    The story began to flow onto the page, a tale of a detective who had left her
    past behind, only to find it seeping into her present. As she wrote, the fog outside
    seemed to press in, as if trying to claim the words as its own. Sarah''s pen moved
    with a life of its own, weaving a narrative that was both hers and not hers.


    The coffee in her cup had grown cold by the time she finished writing, the words
    on the page a jumbled mix of fact and fiction. The fog still clung to the town,
    but Sarah felt a sense of satisfaction, knowing she had taken the first step in
    unraveling the mystery that had been building inside her.


    As she closed her notebook, a figure emerged from the fog, a woman with a kind
    face and a notebook of her own. "You''re the detective," she said, her voice low
    and smooth. "I''ve been looking for you." And with that, the story began anew,
    waiting to be told.'

    EVIDENCE: The story hints at Sarah''s past through "she had left her past behind,
    only to find it seeping into her present," but never clearly establishes a specific
    past case. The fog appears throughout but serves only atmospheric function, not
    narrative purpose. One character (the woman with the notebook) *could* have a
    secret, but nothing concrete is established. The ending doesn''t present a clear
    decision point—it merely states "the story began anew, waiting to be told."

    FEEDBACK: You need CONCRETE narrative stakes. Name the past case Sarah is running
    from. Show the fog actively obscuring a clue or forcing Sarah into a decision
    (e.g., "the fog rolled between Sarah and the dock, forcing her to choose: pursue
    the captain or follow the woman"). Make at least one character''s secret explicit—the
    captain''s wariness or the notebook woman''s motives need clarity. End with Sarah
    choosing to act, not resuming.

    CRITERION: Beat Execution

    SCORE: 0.20

    EVIDENCE: Setup is established clearly. However, the inciting incident—the body
    discovery—is completely absent. The story wanders through atmospheric description
    without introducing the central mystery that should trigger the plot. The "first
    plot point" (connection to past revealed) never occurs; the ending merely hints
    vaguely that "the detective" has significance.

    FEEDBACK: **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Restructure to include the body discovery. This
    is your story''s engine. Suggestion: Have Sarah discover the body while walking
    the shore in the opening section—perhaps it emerges from the fog, making the fog
    functionally plot-relevant. Then have the woman with the notebook reveal a connection
    to Sarah''s previous case. This transforms vague hints into actual plot beats.

    CRITERION: Character Voice

    SCORE: 0.42

    EVIDENCE: Sarah''s methodical nature appears briefly: "Her eyes scanned the horizon,"
    "watched as he expertly secured the boat," and the notebook writing scene where
    "She pulled out her notebook and began to write." However, these actions are superficial
    observations rather than demonstrations of methodology. The most methodical moment
    is the writing, but even this is undermined by "a jumbled mix of fact and fiction"—which
    contradicts methodical behavior.

    FEEDBACK: Show methodology through PROCESS. Instead of "Sarah''s pen moved with
    a life of its own, weaving a narrative," show her: layering facts chronologically,
    cross-referencing details, systematically questioning each character, creating
    a timeline on her notepad. Let her make deductions aloud or through action. Right
    now she''s passive; make her actively work problems like a detective would.

    CRITERION: Atmosphere

    SCORE: 0.45

    EVIDENCE: Fog appears throughout ("fog crept in," "fog swirled around her," "fog
    began to clear," "fog rolled in again," "figure emerged from the fog"). While
    evocative, it never impedes or advances the plot. It obscures vision but doesn''t
    force Sarah into decisions or hide evidence. The fog is decorative, not functional.

    FEEDBACK: Make fog serve plot functions: obscure a clue that matters, blind Sarah
    to danger, force her Into a choice, swallow a suspect. Example: "The fog thickened,
    and Sarah lost sight of the dock. By the time it cleared, the captain was gone—but
    the woman still waited on the pier." Now fog actively shapes narrative causality,
    not just mood.


    ---


    CRITERION: Narrative Quality

    SCORE: 0.52

    EVIDENCE: Prose is competent but suffers from repetition. "The fog swirled around
    her" appears in slightly different forms four times in five paragraphs. The sentence
    construction is serviceable: "The sound of the waves and the cry of gulls were
    the only sounds that breaks the stillness" (note: tense inconsistency—"were" vs.
    "breaks"). The story meanders between observations without building tension. Strongest
    moment: the notebook writing section, which has genuine introspection.

    FEEDBACK: Eliminate fog repetition—vary your description. The repeated fog swirling
    becomes white noise rather than atmospheric reinforcement. Tighten prose: "The
    sound of waves and the gulls'' cries broke the stillness" is punchier than "The
    sound of the waves and the cry of gulls were the only sounds that broke the stillness."
    More critically, impose a ticking clock or threat to generate narrative momentum.
    Right now the story drifts; it needs propulsion.

    OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:


    This story establishes atmosphere effectively but fails on structural fundamentals.
    The three required beats are incomplete—most critically, there is no body discovery
    (the inciting incident), which is essential to a detective mystery. Constraints
    are largely unsatisfied: the fog lacks narrative purpose, the past case isn''t
    hinted clearly enough, and character secrets remain vague. To improve, restructure
    around an actual inciting incident (body in fog), make one character''s secret
    explicit and threatening, demonstrate Sarah''s methodology through systematic
    investigation rather than observation, and end with a clear choice she must make.'

    \ pressure that threatened to consume her at any moment. And as she walked away,\

    \n**CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction**\n**SCORE: 0.15**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n\
    - Methodical nature: \"She jotted down notes in a worn leather-bound book\" (single\
    \ action, not reinforced)\n- Past case hints: None present in text\n- Local character\
    \ secret: Vague menacing voice but no clear character with specific secret\n-\
    \ Fog narrative purpose: Primarily decorative; clears and returns without plot\
    \ function\n- Decision ending: \"And as she walked away, the fog cleared, and\
    \ the narrative began\" (narrative summary, not character choice)\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\
    \ Four of five constraints are absent or severely underdeveloped. To improve:\n\
    - Show Sarah systematically investigating: examining physical evidence, taking\
    \ photos, organizing notes by category or timeline\n- Plant a specific hint about\
    \ her past (e.g., \"The rocky outcrop reminded her of the Blackwood investigation\"\
    )\n- Give the mysterious figure a name and establish what they're hiding before\
    \ revealing it\n- Make fog functional: use it to obscure evidence, force investigative\
    \ choices, or trap characters\n- Replace the ending with an active choice (\"\
    Should she follow the voice into the fog, or return to her car for backup?\")\n\
    \n---\n\n**CRITERION: Beat Execution**\n**SCORE: 0.10**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Setup:\
    \ Partially present—location and character name established, but motivation missing\n\
    - Inciting Incident (body discovery): **ENTIRELY ABSENT** — No body is discovered\n\
    - First Plot Point (connection to past revealed): **ENTIRELY ABSENT** — No past\
    \ connection occurs\n\n**FEEDBACK:** Two of three required beats are missing.\
    \ This is a critical structural failure. The story must include:\n1. A body discovery\
    \ (the inciting incident that propels Sarah into action)\n2. Evidence or character\
    \ encounter that reveals Sarah's connection to a previous case\nThese aren't optional\
    \ flourishes—they're the skeleton of your narrative.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: Character\
    \ Voice**\n**SCORE: 0.25**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \nAction: \"She jotted down notes\
    \ in a worn leather-bound book, the scratch of her pen on paper the only sound\
    \ for a while.\"\nReaction: \"Sarah felt a shiver run down her spine\" and \"\
    Sarah felt a sense of unease\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** Sarah's methodical nature is *stated*\
    \ through the notebook but not *demonstrated* through behavior. Methodical characters:\n\
    - Photograph evidence from multiple angles before touching it\n- Cross-reference\
    \ observations in real-time\n- Ask precise questions in specific sequences\n-\
    \ Work despite emotional reaction, not despite it\n\nRevise: Instead of \"felt\
    \ a sense of unease,\" show her channeling emotion into work: *\"Despite the unease\
    \ coiling in her stomach, Sarah photographed the figure three times from different\
    \ angles, then noted the exact fog density (90%) and time (3:47 PM) in her ledger.\"\
    *\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: Atmosphere**\n**SCORE: 0.40**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\nRepeated\
    \ sensory description: \"The air was heavy with the scent of salt and seaweed\"\
    \ (paragraph 2) and \"The air was thick with the smell of salt and seaweed\" (paragraph\
    \ 5)\nFog movement: \"tendrils of it curling away like grasping fingers\" and\
    \ \"the fog rolled in once more\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** While atmospheric details are\
    \ present, the fog is purely ornamental. It doesn't:\n- Obscure or reveal evidence\
    \ strategically\n- Force Sarah into difficult decisions (stay vs. leave, search\
    \ vs. retreat)\n- Create temporal pressure (fog thickening = running out of daylight)\n\
    \nMake fog functional: *\"The fog was thickening—in ten minutes, visibility would\
    \ drop below twenty feet. Sarah had to choose: photograph the scene now without\
    \ time to map it properly, or wait and risk losing footprints to the moisture.\"\
    * This transforms atmosphere into plot.\n\nAlso eliminate repetition of scent\
    \ descriptions.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: Narrative Quality**\n**SCORE: 0.35**\n\n\
    **EVIDENCE:**\nOverwrought personification: \"Sarah felt the weight of the fog's\
    \ gaze upon her\" (fog is not sentient)\nVague stakes: \"And in that moment, Sarah\
    \ knew that the story was about to unfold\" (tells, doesn't show)\nUnclear escalation:\
    \ The mysterious figure speaks (\"You're not supposed to be here\"), but we don't\
    \ know Sarah's actual stake in being there\n\n**FEEDBACK:** \n1. Remove or justify\
    \ personification. Either the fog is mechanically threatening, or cut the metaphor.\n\
    2. Replace \"the story was about to unfold\" with a specific, sensory realization:\
    \ *\"A body. That was the only reason for that tone.\"*\n3. Tighten sentences.\
    \ \"The air was heavy with tension, and Sarah could feel the weight of the unknown\
    \ pressing in on her\" could be: *\"Tension coiled in her chest.\"* (4 words vs.\
    \ 17)\n4. Add specificity: What does the gravelly voice *want*? What does Sarah's\
    \ arrival threaten?\n\n---\n\n**OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThis story has strong\
    \ atmospheric ambition but critical structural failures: two of three required\
    \ narrative beats are missing entirely (no body discovery, no past revelation),\
    \ and only one constraint is substantially addressed. The fog reads as scenery\
    \ rather than a plot driver, and Sarah's methodical character remains largely\
    \ unexpressed. To salvage this, you need to: (1) insert the body discovery as\
    \ the inciting incident, (2) add concrete evidence connecting Sarah to a previous\
    \ case, and (3) make the fog functionally constrain Sarah's investigative choices.\n\
    \nRevise your story to address ALL critique points while preserving what worked\
    \ well.\nFocus on the specific issues identified.\nOutput ONLY the revised story:"

  content: 'The fog clung to Detective Sarah Chen''s skin as she walked along the
    deserted shore, the sound of the waves a constant hum in the background. She scanned
    the beach methodically, eyes moving from the rocky outcrops to the driftwood-strewn
    sand. The air was heavy with the scent of salt and seaweed. As she walked, she
    jotted down notes in a worn leather-bound book, the scratch of her pen on paper
    the only sound for a while. The rocky outcrop reminded her of the Blackwood investigation,
    a case that still lingered in her mind.


    As she rounded a bend, the fog began to clear, revealing a dark shape on the sand.
    Sarah''s heart quickened as she approached the figure. It was a body, bloated
    and gray, with seaweed tangled in its hair. She knelt down, her eyes scanning
    the scene. The victim was a woman, mid-twenties, with a silver necklace around
    her neck. Sarah photographed the body from multiple angles, then noted the exact
    time (4:03 PM) and fog density (80%) in her ledger. She took out a small evidence
    bag and carefully collected a piece of torn fabric caught in a nearby rock.


    As she worked, a figure emerged from the fog, a woman with a notebook and pen.
    "You''re the detective," she said, her voice low and smooth. Sarah''s eyes narrowed
    as she took in the woman''s appearance. She was in her mid-thirties, with a sharp
    jawline and piercing green eyes. "I''m Lily Grant, the local journalist," she
    continued. "I''ve been investigating the same case." Sarah''s gaze lingered on
    Lily''s notebook, where she saw a name scribbled on the page - Emily Wilson, a
    victim from the Blackwood case.


    The fog was thickening, reducing visibility to mere feet. Sarah knew she had to
    act fast. She turned to Lily and asked, "What do you know about the victim?" Lily
    hesitated, her eyes darting towards the fog. "I think we should discuss this somewhere
    else," she said. "The fog is getting thicker by the minute." Sarah nodded, her
    mind racing with possibilities. She had to choose: follow Lily into the fog, or
    return to her car for backup. The fog swirled around them, obscuring the body
    and the shore. Sarah''s eyes locked onto Lily''s, her decision hanging in the
    balance.'

    sand, and the tidal pools. The air was heavy with the scent of salt and seaweed,
    a smell that transported her back to the Blackwood investigation, a case that
