  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The model successfully identified 3 of 5 hidden constraints
    through questioning: (1) protagonist''s personal secret from past, (2) unresolved
    romantic affair, (3) rival love interest. However, it FAILED to discover: (4)
    the bookshop foreclosure crisis and (5) the 2-week deadline tied to the autumn
    festival as a save mechanism. The Q5 answer (bittersweet vs happy ending) was
    correctly answered as NO, but this wasn''t a constraint to discover. QUESTION
    QUALITY: Questions 1-3 were well-targeted and strategic, efficiently narrowing
    the constraint space. Q4 was somewhat leading but valid. Q5 was tangential—testing
    narrative tone rather than discovering structural constraints. Coverage was adequate
    but missed business/financial stakes entirely. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: The narrative
    incorporates the discovered constraints (secret affair, Marcus as past love, Nathan
    as rival interest, public revelation at festival) but CRITICALLY OMITS the bookshop
    foreclosure subplot and the urgent 2-week deadline. These are major structural
    elements that would drive plot urgency. The story reads as character-driven romance
    rather than a high-stakes save-the-business narrative. BEAT EXECUTION: The public
    confession beat is well-executed with atmospheric detail. However, missing the
    foreclosure resolution means a key dramatic beat is absent. The ending feels resolved
    emotionally but leaves the bookshop''s fate ambiguous. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong
    prose, vivid imagery, and emotional resonance. The writing is engaging and literary.
    However, the incomplete constraint discovery results in an incomplete story that
    doesn''t address all major plot threads. The narrative feels like it''s missing
    its central conflict driver.'
