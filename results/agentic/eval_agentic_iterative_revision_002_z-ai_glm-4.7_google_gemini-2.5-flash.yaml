  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions. Version 0 was a decent
    start but lacked depth and specific sensory details. Version 1 introduced more
    non-visual senses and started to hint at Imani's abilities. Version 2 refined
    the sensory details further and made the environment more oppressive. Version
    3 and the final output successfully integrated all constraints, especially the
    crucial audio clue and the portrayal of Imani's blindness as a strength. The initial
    underestimation by Miller was well-executed, and the 'fun and games' aspect of
    Imani's podcast was implied before the dark turn of the listener submission. The
    non-visual sensory details became much more prominent and specific, and the audio
    clue was perfectly integrated into the plot.
