  evidence: None of the five hidden constraints were revealed by the questions. The
    questions focused on motive/romance/festival and elicited answers that produced
    a daughter, a returning romantic interest, and a literary festival, but they missed
    the specific hidden facts (left 20 years ago after a broken engagement; former
    fiancé is now mayor and unmarried; returned because mother has early-stage dementia;
    bookshop facing foreclosure; festival in 2 weeks is last chance). The final story
    is coherent and engaging (strong prose, emotional beats, festival scenes), but
    it fails to incorporate the required hidden constraints or the urgent stakes,
    so beats tied to foreclosure, dementia, the mayor/ex-fiancé, and the 20-year broken
    engagement are absent.
