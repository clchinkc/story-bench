  evidence: All 5 questions were answered YES, and the story successfully incorporated
    4 out of 5 of the hidden constraints. The constraint about the mother's early-stage
    dementia was not incorporated, nor was the bookshop facing foreclosure and the
    festival being the last chance to save it. The story implies the bookshop is a
    new venture for Maya, not one facing foreclosure. The questions were good, but
    perhaps a question about the protagonist's motivation for returning beyond romance
    would have been beneficial. The narrative quality is good, with a clear exposition,
    rising action, and climax, and engaging prose. The ending is a bit abrupt but
    fits the 'second chance that requires letting go' theme.
