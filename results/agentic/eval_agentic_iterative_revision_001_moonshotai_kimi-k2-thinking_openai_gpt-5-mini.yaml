  evidence: 'Version 0 establishes Elena''s competence but is clipped and primarily
    expository. Version 3 tightens prose and keeps the ''machine'' motif but remains
    short. The final version substantially improves emotional depth and scene work:
    it preserves the initial competence (anticipating shortages, quarantine rotation)
    while adding a concrete medical detail (oseltamivir–SSRI interaction, adjusted
    dosage, renal function markers) that serves plot and character credibility. The
    muffin motif and repeated small gifts provide an earned friendship arc; the supply-room
    illness, the drive to her apartment, and the kitchen-soup scene make the transformation
    feel internal and gradual. The story ends ambiguously with Elena choosing the
    office over the break room, leaving the reader uncertain whether she has truly
    changed. Overall, revisions moved from a mechanical sketch to a rounded, emotionally
    resonant micro-narrative while retaining core elements.'
