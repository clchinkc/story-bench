  evidence: 'The plan is comprehensive, addressing all constraints and beats with
    good specificity. The final output adheres very well to the plan. All 6 constraints
    are met: false lead (Derek Shaw), unconventional profiling (mapping offender movement
    like a living organism, behavioral reflection), ticking clock (72 hours, then
    36 hours), betrayal (Aisha''s public rebuke), midpoint confrontation (phone call
    with Thorne), and Marcus confronting his past failure (''I failed her... I failed
    to catch you. That ends tonight.''). All 4 beats (Catalyst, Debate, Break into
    Two, Midpoint) are clearly executed. The narrative quality is strong, with good
    pacing, tension, and atmospheric detail.'
