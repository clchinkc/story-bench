  evidence: The plan is very complete and specific, detailing how each constraint
    and beat will be met. The final output adheres well to the plan, executing all
    beats and most constraints. The 'secondary character betrayal' is present in the
    plan (Lydia leaking the profile) but is not fully developed or impactful in the
    story; it's mentioned but doesn't feel like a true betrayal of trust that significantly
    alters Marcus's path or the plot, more like an expected action from an antagonist.
    The story ends abruptly, cutting off before the resolution promised in the plan,
    which impacts narrative quality.
