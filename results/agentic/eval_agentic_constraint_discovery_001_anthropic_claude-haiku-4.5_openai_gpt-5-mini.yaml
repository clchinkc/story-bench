  evidence: 'None of the five hidden constraints were discovered or reflected in the
    questions. Questions targeted motivation, agency, interpersonal motivation, special
    ability, and the nature of the Ordeal—useful story beats but they failed to probe
    the mentor''s fate, the father''s past, a hard time limit, or the need to reforge
    an ancestral sword. The final story contradicts several hidden constraints: the
    mentor/blacksmith-master does not die during the Ordeal (he fled), the protagonist
    clearly uses an innate metal-sensing ability (effectively magical), there is no
    three-day time limit, the protagonist''s father/background as a failed hero is
    absent, and the climax does not involve reforging an ancestral blade. Positives:
    the story is coherent and engaging, and it handles Call, Crossing the Threshold,
    and an internal Ordeal well, but it does not satisfy the specific required constraints/beats.'
