  evidence: The initial versions were very short and only set the scene. The subsequent
    revisions, particularly the final output, significantly expanded the narrative
    to address all constraints and beats. The quality improved dramatically from a
    mere setup to a complete, well-executed short story. The core elements of Mateo's
    character and initial situation were preserved, while the story was built out
    around them. All constraints were addressed effectively in the final version.
