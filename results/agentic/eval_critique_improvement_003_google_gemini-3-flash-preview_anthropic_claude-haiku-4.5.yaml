  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.72): Revisions show modest engagement with
    youth_voice feedback. Critiques consistently flagged abstract/metaphorical language
    (''They were so busy waiting to drown...'') as too mature. Final output retains
    some of this (e.g., ''cold hollow in her chest,'' ''rusted effort''), suggesting
    incomplete internalization of feedback. However, visceral physical reactions (''fingers
    stinging,'' ''knuckles went white,'' ''freezing water numbed her arms'') were
    preserved and strengthened, showing partial responsiveness. The dialogue remains
    authentically 12-year-old throughout revisions.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.68): Versions 1-3 are nearly identical, indicating plateau
    rather than iterative refinement. The opening remains unchanged across all versions
    despite critique focus on youth_voice. Strengths (physical sensations, emotional
    outbursts, competence-without-invincibility) were maintained but not deepened.
    The final output adds the Silas confrontation scene and crossing sequence, which
    are strong additions, but these appear to be content expansion rather than critique-driven
    revision. Trajectory shows initial improvement (V0→V1) then stagnation.


    PRESERVATION (0.75): Core strengths well-maintained: Glint-Seeker invention remains
    vivid and plausible; Zara''s voice stays grounded in age-appropriate frustration
    and determination; the worldbuilding (salt-rot, Great Greys, Ghost-Docks) is consistent.
    However, some mature phrasing persists (''cataracts,'' ''mechanical grace,'' ''guttural
    sound''), suggesting selective rather than comprehensive preservation strategy.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.92/5 constraints met):

    1. ✓ COMPETENCE WITHOUT UNREALISM (0.9): Zara builds functional device but needs
    mentor; succeeds through ingenuity + courage, not superhuman ability. Minor: her
    pressure-seal patch feels slightly convenient.

    2. ✓ ADULT DISMISSAL (1.0): Both father (''ghost-signals,'' ''games'') and Mayor
    Vance (''just a kid'') explicitly dismiss her. Vance''s dismissal is particularly
    well-executed.

    3. ✓ FLAWED MENTOR (0.95): Silas is paralyzed by trauma (failed sea-walls), uses
    static-radio as avoidance mechanism, initially refuses responsibility. Flaw is
    specific and psychologically coherent. Minor: redemption arc feels slightly swift.

    4. ✓ INVENTION DEMONSTRATION (1.0): Glint-Seeker is creative (microwave + fiber-optic
    + solar cell), functional, and integral to plot. Demonstrates ingenuity clearly.

    5. ✓ REAL DANGER (0.85): Shear-Lines crossing includes genuine hazards (rusted
    girders, engine failure, water ingress, 45-degree tilt). Zara''s hands go numb;
    physical consequences are real. Minor: resolution feels slightly expedited (seal
    holds immediately).


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.85): Hero''s Journey structure present and functional:

    - Call to Adventure: Archive discovery ✓

    - Refusal: Father dismissal, Vance dismissal ✓

    - Meeting Mentor: Silas encounter ✓

    - Crossing Threshold: Shear-Lines crossing ✓

    - Tests/Allies: Engine failure, Zara''s seal patch ✓

    - Approach: Aquarium dome sighting ✓

    - Ordeal: Water ingress, Silas''s panic ✓

    Minor gap: No clear ''Return with Elixir'' beat (ends mid-quest). Structure is
    present but incomplete.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.82): Prose is vivid and age-appropriate in strongest moments
    (''Her face burned,'' ''knuckles went white''). Worldbuilding is immersive (salt-rot,
    Great Greys, Ghost-Docks create coherent post-climate setting). Dialogue is natural.
    Pacing accelerates effectively from discovery→dismissal→action→crossing. Emotional
    stakes are clear. Minor weaknesses: some mature abstractions remain; Silas''s
    character arc compresses slightly; ending feels like mid-scene cut rather than
    narrative beat. Hope is present (Zara''s determination, Silas''s redemption) without
    saccharine tone.'
