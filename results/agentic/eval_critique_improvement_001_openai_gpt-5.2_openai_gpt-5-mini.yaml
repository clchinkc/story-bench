  evidence: Revisions show clear, focused improvement. Early version established setting
    and some method but leaned toward exposition. Subsequent edits tightened prose,
    replaced exposition with concrete actions (click, notebook entries, grid search),
    and strengthened the fog as an active narrative force. The reveal of the wrist
    tag that matches the folder tab in Sarah’s car effectively echoes her past case—this
    hint is seeded before the discovery—while Elias’s withheld information supplies
    a local secret. Strengths (Sarah’s methodical voice, atmosphere) are preserved
    and amplified; pacing and dramatic focus improved noticeably from V0→V3.
