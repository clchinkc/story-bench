  evidence: 'PLAN ANALYSIS: The plan is comprehensive and well-structured with clear
    beat identification and thematic coherence. Spatial Empathy Mapping is creatively
    conceived as an unconventional profiling technique. The plan explicitly addresses
    false lead (Brennan), ticking clock (seven cranes/seven days), betrayal (Lena''s
    podcast), and past failure confrontation (Whitmore''s dialogue). However, the
    plan lacks explicit structural clarity for the Midpoint confrontation—it''s mentioned
    but not distinctly separated as a required beat.


    OUTPUT ANALYSIS: CONSTRAINTS (5/6 satisfied): (1) FALSE LEAD ✓—Thomas Brennan
    is thoroughly developed as a red herring with planted evidence; (2) UNCONVENTIONAL
    PROFILING ✓—Spatial Empathy Mapping is demonstrated through the walks and geographic
    pattern recognition; (3) TICKING CLOCK ✓—Seven cranes/seven days creates clear
    urgency with day-by-day progression; (4) SECONDARY CHARACTER BETRAYAL ✓—Lena''s
    podcast betrayal is impactful and well-executed; (5) PAST FAILURE CONFRONTATION
    ✓—Whitmore explicitly references Sarah''s death and Marcus''s hesitation; (6)
    MIDPOINT DIRECT CONFRONTATION ✗—The Whitmore confrontation in the lecture hall
    is present but occurs at day 5 of 7, placing it late rather than at true midpoint.
    More critically, it lacks the structural weight and emotional/thematic resolution
    expected of a midpoint—it functions more as exposition than confrontation.


    BEATS (3/4 satisfied): (1) CATALYST ✓—The origami crane package is a clear, compelling
    inciting incident; (2) DEBATE ✓—Diana''s rejection and Ray''s skepticism create
    internal/external debate; (3) BREAK INTO TWO ✓—The Brennan false lead represents
    commitment to action; (4) MIDPOINT ✗—While a confrontation occurs, it lacks the
    structural prominence and turning-point function required. The revelation about
    Ray being the target happens after, suggesting the true midpoint may be misplaced.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong atmospheric writing with effective rain imagery and
    emotional resonance. Pacing is generally solid with escalating tension. The voice
    is consistent and the mystery logic is coherent. Weaknesses: the Midpoint lacks
    structural clarity and emotional payoff; the ending feels slightly rushed with
    the Ray revelation compressed into final paragraphs rather than being the climactic
    midpoint revelation.'
