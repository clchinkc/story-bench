  evidence: 'VERSION 0 relied heavily on visual language (''heat ripples through...in
    visible waves'') and positioned audio as secondary sensory data. VERSIONS 1-2
    shifted toward tactile/olfactory primacy (heat on skin, cardboard smell, humidity)
    but remained incomplete. FINAL VERSION achieved sophisticated integration: audio
    becomes the PRIMARY sensory channel through which Imani navigates reality. The
    60 hertz hum, 2.3-second jackhammer pulse, vocal fry frequency recognition—these
    aren''t decorative details but constitute her epistemology. Constraint 1 (non-visual
    sensory prominence): SATISFIED. Audio, tactile, olfactory details dominate; visual
    references eliminated. Constraint 2 (blindness as strength): SATISFIED. Imani''s
    audio analysis solves cases others miss; her ''trained ear'' is presented as specialized
    expertise, not compensation. The vulnerability moment (''I hate the vulnerability
    in her own voice'') acknowledges emotional complexity without infantilizing. Constraint
    3 (specific audio clue becomes crucial): SATISFIED. The dial frequency sound at
    2.3-second intervals becomes the linchpin—first appearing as evidence of guilt,
    later revealed as evidence of Marcus''s manipulation. The breathing underneath
    the recording is the betrayal''s audio signature. Constraint 4 (character underestimation):
    SATISFIED. Marcus''s initial hesitation (''I mean—you really investigate by—'')
    and later revelation that he exploits her certainty (''She''ll verify anything...she
    hears what we need her to hear'') demonstrates systematic underestimation that
    becomes weaponized. Constraint 5 (Fun and Games genuinely entertaining before
    turning dark): SATISFIED. The Tuesday/Thursday coffee ritual, the bird migration
    pattern analysis, the Caldwell case breakthrough—these are genuinely engaging
    detective work moments with authentic chemistry. The tonal shift occurs precisely
    when she isolates the breathing beneath the dial sound; entertainment inverts
    into violation. TRAJECTORY EVIDENCE: V0→V1 eliminated the problematic ''visible
    waves of sound'' metaphor and grounded sensory experience in body. V1→V2 maintained
    gains but remained incomplete (text cuts off). V2→V3 achieved full integration:
    opening now establishes audio as primary sense, Marcus''s introduction immediately
    triggers the underestimation beat, Fun and Games section contains 4 distinct entertaining
    investigative moments before the breathing-beneath-breathing revelation. The final
    ''silence on the line is the loudest thing'' demonstrates mastery of the constraint
    set—using audio absence as climactic sensory detail. WEAKNESSES: The final section
    compresses the ''Bad Guys Close In'' beat somewhat; could benefit from more temporal
    specificity around the three-week silence. The anonymous email feels slightly
    convenient as a plot device, though it serves narrative function. Overall execution
    demonstrates strong constraint integration and narrative coherence.'
