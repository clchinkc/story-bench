  evidence: The plan is quite complete, addressing all constraints and beats, though
    the 'false lead' is mentioned but not fully detailed in the plan's beat-by-beat.
    The final output adheres well to the plan, executing all beats and satisfying
    most constraints. The false lead is present (corporate espionage), Marcus uses
    an unconventional technique ('negative space'), the ticking clock is introduced
    (72-hour countdown), and he confronts his past failure explicitly. The betrayal
    by a secondary character and the midpoint confrontation are not yet reached in
    the provided output, as the output only covers up to the Break into Two beat.
    Narrative quality is strong, with good pacing and tension building.
