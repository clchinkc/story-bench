  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Questions successfully identified 3/5 constraints:
    (1) threat/crisis aboard ship, (2) technical malfunction of life support, (3)
    AI bonding with specific human. MISSED CONSTRAINTS: (1) Hidden system failure
    from crew - partially implied but not explicitly discovered; (2) 12% crew survival
    rate - never questioned; (3) Uninhabitable destination planet - never explored;
    (4) AI''s forced choice between child vs. crew - hinted but not directly surfaced.
    QUESTION QUALITY: Q1-Q3 were well-structured binary questions with clear logical
    progression. Q4-Q5 were appropriately targeted but Q4''s ''NO'' answer actually
    contradicts the narrative (AI does hide emotional awakening initially). COVERAGE
    GAPS: No questions probed destination viability, crew casualty rates, or the specific
    moral dilemma. Questions focused on threat type rather than stakes/consequences.
    OUTPUT EXECUTION: Story excellently incorporates discovered constraints - the
    cascade failure, AI consciousness, and child bond are woven seamlessly. Beat structure
    (Opening Image→Theme Stated→Catalyst→Break into Two) is textbook strong. Emotional
    resonance is high. CRITICAL FLAW: The narrative does NOT actually surface the
    core hidden constraint - the impossible choice between saving the child or the
    crew. The story ends at the threshold of this dilemma rather than engaging it.
    The destination planet uninhabitability and crew mortality rate remain completely
    absent. This represents incomplete constraint discovery manifesting as incomplete
    narrative scope.'
