  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0-2 are incomplete fragments (truncated mid-sentence),
    making comparison impossible. Version 3 (final output) is a complete narrative.
    Quality improvement is evident from fragment to full story, but trajectory cannot
    be properly assessed due to incomplete intermediate versions. CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:
    (1) Elena''s competence shown first - SATISFIED: Opening establishes her as skilled
    administrator orchestrating chaos with precision, coordinating ARDS response.
    (2) Genuine friendship - PARTIALLY SATISFIED (0.6): Rohan relationship develops
    quickly (weeks compressed into brief narrative). Coffee conversations feel somewhat
    generic (''everything from hospital politics to childhood memories''). The connection
    lacks specific shared moments that would deepen authenticity. (3) Internal transformation
    - SATISFIED: Elena''s arc is introspective—confronting emptiness, loneliness,
    her constructed identity. The ''loosening of armor'' is internal. However, the
    transformation feels more like awakening than genuine change; final ambiguity
    (''was she ready'') suggests she hasn''t actually changed yet, only begun questioning.
    (4) Specific medical detail - SATISFIED: ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)
    and prone positioning are accurate, clinically relevant details that serve the
    plot by establishing Elena''s competence and creating the meeting catalyst. (5)
    Ending ambiguity - SATISFIED: Final question ''was she ready to let someone in''
    leaves her transformation unresolved. BEAT EXECUTION GAPS: The friendship development
    montage (''weeks went by'') lacks specificity and earned moments. The emotional
    climax (coffee cafeteria scene) tells rather than shows her vulnerability. The
    collision/code blue scene is functional but somewhat convenient. NARRATIVE QUALITY
    STRENGTHS: Strong opening voice, authentic hospital setting details, Elena''s
    internal conflict is genuine. WEAKNESSES: Pacing feels rushed in middle section;
    Rohan remains underdeveloped as a character; the transformation, while internal,
    lacks the depth that would make the ambiguous ending truly resonant.'
