  evidence: 'Versions 0–2 are nearly identical and minimal. The Final output shows
    a clear improvement: added scenes (Mr. Hernandez at the store, the envelope on
    the kitchen table, Abuela''s embroidery, the garden conversation), stronger sensory/cultural
    detail (chilies, embroidery, ''mijo''), and a clearer decision arc as Mateo prepares
    to leave. However, the story still sometimes ''tells'' the internal conflict rather
    than consistently showing it (e.g., ''Here was the conflict that had silently
    grown within him''), so the ''show, not tell'' constraint is not fully met. The
    grandmother moment does crystallize the choice, and at least one adult (Mr. Hernandez,
    and Abuela) genuinely understands him. Cultural elements feel mostly authentic,
    and the resolution is earned through a modestly developed internal shift, though
    the growth could be deepened.'
