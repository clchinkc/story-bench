  evidence: 'VERSION 0 established the core setup but relied on exposition (''walking
    bridge'') without demonstrating internal conflict. VERSIONS 1-2 introduced the
    deadline tension and specific sensory details (lisinopril, grillo), creating visible
    conflict through juxtaposition rather than telling. The FINAL OUTPUT fully executes
    all constraints: (1) Internal conflict shown through the phone buzz/prescription
    weight juxtaposition, the 11:54 PM submission scene, and the mother''s text creating
    competing loyalties—never stated as ''he felt torn'' but embodied through action
    and timing. (2) Grandmother moment crystallizes choice: the face-cupping scene
    where Abuela asks ''Why is your body still here?'' directly addresses his self-imposed
    obligation and reframes his departure as growth, not abandonment. This is the
    emotional fulcrum. (3) Mr. Henderson genuinely understands—he diagnoses the problem
    (''so busy being a bridge that you''ve forgotten people can learn to swim'') and
    offers permission rooted in his own observation of the community, not platitude.
    (4) Cultural authenticity: Spanish terms (*grillo*, *piloto*, *mijo*, *polvorones*)
    are integrated functionally, not decoratively; Abuela''s border-crossing history
    informs her wisdom; the pharmacy/hardware store/bus station are specific to working-class
    Arizona life. (5) Resolution earned: Mateo doesn''t abandon family—he submits
    the application after genuine deliberation, his mother responds with complex pride
    rather than forgiveness, and Abuela''s final ''I''ve learned how to say cricket
    in English'' shows she''s already adapting. The ending weight ''belonged to him
    alone'' reflects earned maturity, not escape. Revisions progressively sharpened:
    V0→V1 added deadline specificity; V1→V2 improved metaphor (''rivets groaning''
    vs ''buckling''); V2→Final added Henderson''s dialogue and the 11:54 PM climax,
    transforming abstract conflict into concrete decision-making. All strong elements
    (opening heat imagery, Abuela''s voice, the bridge metaphor) preserved throughout.'
