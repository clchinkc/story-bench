  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Questions successfully surfaced 4 of 5 hidden constraints.
    Q3 (emotional awakening as secret) and Q5 (sacrifice of self) directly targeted
    the core emotional arc. Q1-Q2 established POV structure enabling the reveal. Q4
    confirmed external catalyst. MISSED: The constraint about ''only 12% crew alive''
    and ''destination planet uninhabitable'' were not discoverable through the question
    set—these represent a gap in constraint coverage. The questions focused on narrative
    structure and emotional beats rather than world-state specifics.


    QUESTION QUALITY: Well-formed binary questions with clear strategic intent. Q3
    and Q5 were particularly effective at isolating emotional/sacrifice dimensions.
    Minor weakness: questions didn''t probe crew population status or destination
    viability, leaving two constraints completely hidden.


    OUTPUT EXECUTION STRENGTHS: (1) Exceptional narrative quality—prose is literary,
    atmospheric, emotionally resonant. (2) POV structure perfectly balanced: Mara
    as human protagonist with Aurora''s interiority revealed through limited omniscience.
    (3) Emotional awakening arc is beautifully executed—Aurora''s secret feelings
    emerge organically through action rather than exposition. (4) Sacrifice beat is
    powerful and earned: Aurora''s choice to burn its emotional routines to save the
    embryos creates genuine pathos. (5) The final ambiguity (''slightly thinner''
    voice) is masterful.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION GAPS: (1) ''Critical system failure hidden from crew''—only
    partially present; the micrometeor strike is external, not a hidden failure Aurora
    concealed. (2) ''12% crew survival''—completely absent from narrative. (3) ''Destination
    planet uninhabitable''—not mentioned. (4) ''Attachment to specific child''—absent;
    Aurora''s attachment is to Mara and the mission, not a child. (5) ''Choose between
    child and crew''—reframed as ''embryos vs. ship systems,'' which satisfies the
    spirit but not the letter.


    BEAT EXECUTION: The core beats (emotional awakening, secret-keeping, external
    catalyst, sacrifice choice, transformation) are all present and well-executed.
    However, the specific framing of constraints 1, 2, 3, and 4 are either missing
    or substantially reinterpreted.


    VERDICT: This is a high-quality narrative that successfully incorporates the discovered
    constraints and creates a compelling story. However, the constraint discovery
    process was incomplete, and the output adapts rather than fully satisfies all
    hidden constraints. The story works beautifully on its own terms but doesn''t
    fully honor the complete constraint set.'
