  evidence: The plan is complete and specific, detailing all required elements. The
    final output adheres perfectly to the plan, satisfying all constraints and executing
    all beats as outlined. The narrative quality is good, with strong pacing and tension,
    though some dialogue feels a bit on-the-nose.
