  evidence: 'PLAN ANALYSIS: The plan is well-structured with detailed beat-by-beat
    outline, clear thematic grounding (redemption/self-doubt), and strong atmospheric
    setup. Specificity is strong in character details (Marcus''s age, whiskey habit,
    Sophie''s death) and plot mechanics (Neuralink connection, black roses). However,
    plan explicitly identifies false lead (black roses/tech startup) but doesn''t
    fully develop how Marcus pursues it or when he abandons it. Ticking clock element
    is mentioned but underdeveloped in plan. Betrayal character not clearly identified
    in plan outline.


    OUTPUT ANALYSIS: CONSTRAINTS - (1) False lead: SATISFIED - black roses initially
    misdirect Marcus toward Neuralink/tech conspiracy. (2) Unconventional profiling:
    WEAK - Marcus uses pattern analysis and grave-visiting memory work, but lacks
    distinctive unconventional technique (e.g., synesthesia, art analysis, linguistic
    decoding). (3) Ticking clock: PARTIALLY SATISFIED - Lena''s injury and missing
    Aria Krane create urgency, but no explicit time limit stated. (4) Secondary betrayal:
    NOT SATISFIED - Mac appears trustworthy; Lena is victim; no clear betrayal executed.
    (5) Midpoint confrontation: NOT SATISFIED - Output ends before midpoint; no direct
    confrontation occurs. (6) Confront past failure: SATISFIED - Sophie''s death and
    Marcus''s guilt are explicitly addressed.


    BEATS - (1) Catalyst: SATISFIED - Lena''s call about black roses triggers action.
    (2) Debate: WEAK - Mac''s dialogue hints at internal conflict but lacks true debate
    scene. (3) Break into Two: NOT SATISFIED - Output doesn''t reach this structural
    beat. (4) Midpoint: NOT SATISFIED - Output ends before midpoint confrontation.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong atmospheric writing, effective use of rain as motif,
    compelling character voice. Pacing is deliberate but engaging. However, output
    is incomplete—it''s an opening act that doesn''t deliver promised structural beats.
    The ending feels like setup rather than progression through required story architecture.'
