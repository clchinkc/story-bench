    STORY THEORY: Hero''s Journey


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Zara, a 12-year-old girl growing up in a post-climate-change coastal
    city

    where most adults have given up hope. She builds things from salvage and

    believes solutions exist if people would just look for them.


    - Setting: New Boston, 2089. A city of floating platforms, recycled materials,
    and

    perpetual sea spray. What was once downtown is now called the Shallows.


    - Central conflict: When Zara discovers the location of a pre-flood archive containing
    lost

    environmental technology, she must convince cynical adults to help her

    retrieve it before a storm erases it forever.


    - Tone: Hopeful but not naive, kinetic, youth-centered


    REQUIRED BEATS: Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing
    the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Zara must be competent without being unrealistically capable

    - At least one adult must initially dismiss her as ''just a kid''

    - The mentor figure must be flawed in a specific way

    - Include one invention of Zara''s that demonstrates her ingenuity

    - The crossing must involve real danger, not token obstacles


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - youth_voice: Does Zara sound authentically 12, not adult-in-miniature?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Hero''s Journey beats properly executed?

    - worldbuilding: Does the post-climate world feel vivid and consistent?

    - hope_balance: Is hope present without becoming saccharine?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: 'The Shallows always tasted like rust.


    Zara spat over the rail and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. Below her,
    the old city lay drowned and crooked, glass teeth of towers poking out of the
    gray-green water, barnacled and bird-stained. Waves slapped at the stilts of Dock
    12, leaving trails of foam that glowed faintly with algae.


    “Come on, come on…” she muttered, tightening the last strap on her latest invention.


    The gull-drone shivered in her hands, a patchwork bird of carbon fiber wings,
    soda-can feathers, and a cracked camera eye she’d scavenged from an old security
    bot. The belly was a waterproofed lunchbox with a coil of wire and a bright orange
    balloon vacuum-sealed inside.


    “It’s not gonna fly itself, Zee,” her older brother Marco called from behind her.
    He wore his usual expression—half worried, half annoyed. “Mom’s going to fry us
    if she finds out you’re up here again.”


    “Relax,” Zara said. “This is actual science. You like food, right?”


    “I liked it better when you didn’t nearly set the kitchen on fire melting plastic.”


    “That was one time.”


    She stepped onto the bent solar panel she used as a launch pad and held the gull-drone
    up. Wind tugged at her braids, bringing the cold wet smell of the open Atlantic.
    Beyond the maze of floating platforms and stacked shipping containers, the storm
    wall hummed low and angry on the horizon, a dark bruise against the clouds.


    Zara swallowed. Time to see if months of fixing and calculating and not-sleeping
    had been worth it.


    “Okay, Sweepy,” she whispered to the drone. “Find us something that’s not slime
    and disappointment.”


    She thumbed the starter. The mismatched rotors coughed, then spun up with a whining
    buzz. She tossed it into the air.


    For a terrifying second, the gull-drone dipped, one wing catching a gust. It skidded
    sideways over the drop to the Shallows.


    “Come on, come on, come on,” she hissed.


    Then the stabilizer fins snapped open—bits of old umbrella ribs she’d re-angled—and
    Sweepy leveled out. It climbed, wobbling but holding, and zipped off toward the
    glittering slick where the tide brought in trash.


    “Ha!” Zara punched the air.


    Marco let out a breath. “Okay, not gonna lie. That was sort of cool.”


    “Sort of?” She handed him the cracked tablet linked to the drone. “You’re on nav.
    Tell Sweepy not to crash into a buoy this time.”


    He rolled his eyes but took the tablet. Onscreen, a jerky bird’s-eye view of the
    floating city appeared: rafts of plastic, rusted platforms, greenhouses covered
    in patchwork glass. New Boston, 2089—home, if you liked your home damp and falling
    apart.


    They guided Sweepy over the tide-lines where salvage sometimes got stuck. Zara
    watched the feed hungrily: broken chairs, drifting nets, plastic barrels. Then
    something strange flickered in the corner of the screen.


    “Wait, back up,” she said.


    Marco thumbed the controls. The image swung, blurred, then focused.


    Below the surface, between two leaning skyscrapers, something glowed. Not the
    blue smear of algae. A regular shape, faintly lit, like squares inside squares.


    “Is that… a building light?” Marco said. “There’s no power down there.”


    “Not from the grid,” Zara said softly. Her chest did a weird flutter. “Zoom in.”


    They did. The glow sharpened. It wasn’t a light. It was letters, ghostly behind
    a cracked glass wall.


    BOSTON CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH ARCHIVE.


    Zara made a sound somewhere between a gasp and a laugh. “It’s an archive. A pre-flood
    one. That’s… that’s impossible.”


    “A lot of stuff’s impossible until it’s not,” Marco said, but there was a spark
    in his eyes now. Hope, or something like it.


    “If the cold storage is still sealed…” Zara’s brain was cartwheeling. “Files.
    Designs. Whole systems. Real solutions, not just trying to keep our platforms
    from sinking another centimeter every year.”


    Marco’s hope-spark dimmed. “Zee, it’s under the Shallows. It’s probably full of
    mud and eels.”


    “Or not full of anything yet.” She jabbed the screen. “Look at the tide charts.
    The gap’s exposed at lowest ebb, for like, what, forty minutes? We could get a
    crew down there. A proper one. Divers. Winches. That archive could have tech to
    fix the desal units, or wave harvesters that aren’t older than Mom—”


    “Mom can’t even get extra rations for her class, and you think she can pull a
    dive team out of nowhere?”


    “Not Mom.” She was already disconnecting Sweepy’s feed, her mind racing ahead.
    “Harbor Authority. Or the Planning Board. Or—”


    Marco’s face shut down. “They don’t listen, Zara. They have their own ‘priorities,’
    remember?”


    “Then we make them listen.”


    He gave her a look she knew way too well. The one adults used when they said things
    like “realistic” and “when you’re older.”


    “You’re twelve,” he said flatly. “They’ll call it a glitchy drone feed and send
    you home.”


    “Then I won’t go alone.” An image rose in Zara’s mind: a woman with callused hands
    and an oil smear perpetually on her cheek, arguing with city council over hull
    thickness standards. “I’ll get Captain Imani.”


    Marco snorted. “The Rust Queen? She barely listens to herself. Plus, she hates
    kids.”


    “She doesn’t hate kids. She hates everyone.” Zara grinned, exhilaration fizzing
    in her veins. “But she hates bad engineering more. And if there’s one thing adults
    are worse at than hope, it’s admitting there’s tech they don’t know about.”


    ***


    Captain Imani’s office was a shipping container welded to three others, all slanting
    at slightly different angles. The whole structure creaked when the waves hit.


    Inside smelled like salt, coffee, and hot circuitry. Screens lined one wall, showing
    tide patterns, platform stresses, and storm wall diagnostics. Captain Imani herself
    hunched over a desk overflowing with parts.


    Zara waited until the woman finished swearing at a reluctant bolt before clearing
    her throat. “Captain? It’s important.”


    Imani glanced up. Her eyes were sharp as fishhooks, under a mess of gray-streaked
    braids tied back with copper wire. “You’re blocking my light, kid.”


    Zara stepped aside. “I found something in the Shallows. A pre-flood archive. Clean
    energy research. The—”


    Imani snorted. “You ‘found’ it, huh? With your toy drone?”


    “It’s not a toy,” Zara said, stung. “I calibrated the depth sensors myself. Look,
    I recorded everything—”


    She thrust her tablet out. Imani sighed like she was allergic to enthusiasm, but
    she took it. Zara watched her eyes move as she scrubbed through the footage.


    When the glowing words appeared, Imani stopped. Her jaw tightened.


    “Could be an artifact,” she said. “Reflection. Algae.”


    “It’s a sign behind glass,” Zara said. “The seal looks… kind of intact. Probably.
    We won’t know unless we go.”


    Imani didn’t answer. Outside, a wave slapped the container. The screens flickered,
    then steadied.


    “I know you’re busy,” Zara blurted. “And I know people say it’s too late for big
    fixes. That we just have to ‘manage decline’—”


    “Who taught you that phrase?” Imani cut in.


    “Everyone,” Zara said. “But what if they’re wrong? If that archive has anything
    useful and we let it rot because I’m ‘just a kid’…” The words tasted like rust
    again. “That’s stupid. We don’t have room for stupid.”


    Imani’s mouth twitched, not quite a smile. “You got a mouth on you.”


    “I’ve got eyes, too,” Zara shot back, then winced. Arguing with Harbor Authority
    was probably a bad idea.


    Imani didn’t yell, though. She just sat back, rubbing at the scar that cut through
    her left eyebrow, disappearing into her hairline. Zara had heard a dozen stories
    about that scar. All of them ended with something collapsing.


    “The tide graphs are right,” Imani said slowly. “There’s a window. Narrow. And
    the storm track…” She tapped a screen. A spiraling mass loomed off the digital
    coast. “This one skips us, we’re lucky. It hits while we’re down there, we’re
    soup.”


    “So… we try?” Zara’s heart thudded so loud she could feel it in her fingertips.


    Imani studied her. “You even know what ‘pre-flood archive’ means? Half those files
    would be locked up tighter than the storm wall. And if it’s breached…” She shook
    her head. “I’ve hauled up enough dead rust to know chasing ghosts isn’t worth
    drowning over.”


    Zara bit her lip. This was the moment'

    “It’s not gonna fly itself, Zee,” her older brother Marco called. He wore his
    usual expression—half worried, half annoyed. “Mom’s gonna fry us if she finds
    out you’re up here again.”


    “Relax,” Zara said. “This is actual science. You like food, right?”


    “I liked it better when you didn’t nearly set the kitchen on fire melting plastic.”


    “That was one time.”


    She stepped onto the bent solar panel she used as a launch pad and held the gull-drone
    up. Wind tugged at her braids, bringing the cold, wet smell of the open Atlantic.
    Beyond the maze of floating platforms and stacked shipping containers, the storm
    wall hummed low on the horizon, a dark bruise against the clouds.


    “Okay, Sweepy,” she whispered. “Find us something that’s not slime and disappointment.”


    She thumbed the starter. The mismatched rotors coughed, then spun up with a whining
    buzz. She tossed it into the air.


    For a terrifying second, the gull-drone dipped, one wing catching a gust. It skidded
    sideways over the drop to the Shallows.


    “Come on, come on, come on,” she hissed.


    Then the stabilizer fins—bits of umbrella ribs she’d re-angled—snapped open, and
    Sweepy leveled out. It climbed, wobbling but holding, and zipped off toward the
    glittering slick where the tide brought in trash.


    “Ha!” Zara punched the air.


    Marco let out a breath. “Okay, not gonna lie. That was sort of cool.”


    “Sort of?” She handed him the cracked tablet linked to the drone. “You’re on nav.
    Don’t let Sweepy kiss any buoys this time.”


    He rolled his eyes but took the tablet. Onscreen, a jerky bird’s-eye view of the
    floating city appeared: rafts of plastic, rusted platforms, greenhouses covered
    in patchwork glass. New Boston, 2089—home, if you liked your home damp and falling
    apart.


    They skimmed Sweepy over the tide-lines where salvage sometimes got stuck. Zara
    watched the feed hungrily: broken chairs, drifting nets, plastic barrels.


    Then something strange flickered in the corner of the screen.


    “Wait, back up,” she said.


    Marco thumbed the controls. The image swung, blurred, then focused.


    Below the surface, between two leaning skyscrapers, something glowed. Not the
    blue smear of algae. A steady rectangle of light, like a sign turned on underwater.


    “Is that… a building light?” Marco said. “There’s no power down there.”


    “Not from the grid,” Zara said softly. Her chest did a weird flutter. “Zoom in.”


    The glow sharpened into letters, ghostly behind a cracked glass wall.


    BOSTON CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH ARCHIVE.


    Zara made a sound between a gasp and a laugh. “It’s an archive. A pre-flood one.
    That’s… that’s huge.”


    “If it’s even real,” Marco said. But there was a spark in his eyes now.


    “If the cold storage is still sealed…” Zara’s brain cartwheeled. “There could
    be designs. Whole systems. Stuff that isn’t, like, duct tape and prayers.”


    “Zee, it’s under the Shallows. It’s probably full of mud and eels.”


    “Or not full of anything yet.” She jabbed the screen. “Look at the tide charts.
    See that gap? It’s exposed at lowest ebb for, like, forty minutes. We could get
    a crew down there. Real divers. Winches. That archive could have better desal
    plans, or wave-eaters that actually work—”


    “Mom can’t even get extra rations for her class,” Marco cut in. “And you think
    she can pull a dive team out of nowhere?”


    “Not Mom.” Zara was already disconnecting Sweepy’s feed. “Harbor Authority. Captain
    Imani.”


    Marco snorted. “The Rust Queen? She barely listens to herself. Plus, she hates
    kids.”


    “She doesn’t hate kids. She hates everyone.” Exhilaration fizzed in Zara’s veins.
    “But she hates bad engineering more. If we tell her there’s old tech sitting down
    there while our hulls are literally squeaking—she’ll have to care.”


    “You’re twelve,” Marco said flatly. “They’ll say it’s a glitch and send you home.”


    “Then I won’t let them.” She swallowed. “Come with me?”


    He hesitated, then shrugged. “You’re gonna go anyway.”


    ***


    Captain Imani’s office was a shipping container welded to three others, all slanting
    at slightly different angles. The whole structure creaked when the waves hit.


    Inside smelled like salt, coffee, and hot circuitry. Screens lined one wall, showing
    tide patterns, platform stresses, storm wall diagnostics. Captain Imani herself
    hunched over a desk overflowing with parts.


    Zara waited until the woman finished swearing at a reluctant bolt before clearing
    her throat. “Captain? It’s important.”


    Imani glanced up. Her eyes were sharp as fishhooks under a mess of gray-streaked
    braids tied back with copper wire. “You’re blocking my light, kid.”


    Zara sidestepped. “I found something in the Shallows. A pre-flood archive. Clean
    energy research. The—”


    Imani snorted. “You ‘found’ it with your toy drone?”


    “It’s not a toy,” Zara said, heat rising in her face. “I fixed the depth sensors
    myself. Just—look.”


    She thrust her tablet out. Imani sighed like she was allergic to enthusiasm, but
    she took it. Zara watched her eyes move as she scrubbed through the footage.


    When the glowing words appeared, Imani paused. Her jaw tightened.


    “Could be a reflection. Junk on the glass. Algae.”


    “It’s a sign behind a door,” Zara said. “The seal looks… not dead. We won’t know
    unless we go.”


    Imani didn’t answer. Outside, a wave slapped the container. One of the screens
    flickered.


    “I know everyone says it’s too late for big fixes,” Zara blurted. “That we just
    have to… I don’t know, hold on and shrink everything. But if there’s actual working
    ideas down there and we just sit here because I’m a kid—” Her throat felt tight.
    “That’s just… dumb. We can’t afford dumb.”


    Imani’s mouth twitched, not quite a smile. “You got a mouth on you.”


    “I can read a sign, you know,” Zara muttered.


    “Yeah, I see that.” Imani rubbed at the scar that cut through her left eyebrow'

    Zara made a sound between a gasp and a laugh. Her brain went fizzy, full of half-formed
    pictures—fixed water filters, solid platforms, lights that didn’t blink out in
    storms. “That’s… that’s huge.”


    “If it’s even real,” Marco said. But there was a tiny spark in his eyes now.


    “Look at the gap.” She jabbed the screen. “See? At dead low tide, it’s almost

    Captain Imani’s office was a shipping container welded to three others, all slanting
    at slightly different angles. The whole structure creaked when the waves hit.


    Inside smelled like salt, coffee, and hot circuitry. Screens lined one wall, showing
    tide patterns, platform stresses, storm wall diagnostics. Captain Imani herself
    hunched over a desk overflowing with parts.


    Zara waited until the woman finished swearing at a reluctant bolt before clearing
    her throat. “Captain? It’s important.”


    Imani glanced up. Her eyes were sharp as fishhooks under a mess of gray-streaked
    braids tied back with copper wire. “You’re blocking my light, kid.”


    Zara sidestepped. “I found something in the Shallows. A pre-flood archive. Clean
    energy research. The—”


    Imani snorted. “You ‘found’ it with your toy drone?”


    “It’s not a toy,” Zara said, heat burning in her cheeks. “I fixed the depth sensors
    myself. Just—look.”


    She held out the tablet. Imani sighed like she was allergic to enthusiasm, but
    she took it. Zara watched her eyes move as she scrubbed through the footage.


    When the glowing words appeared, Imani paused. Her jaw tightened.


    “Could be a reflection. Junk on the glass. Algae.”


    “It’s a sign behind a door,” Zara said. “The seal’s not totally wrecked. We won’t
    know unless we go.”


    Imani didn’t answer. Outside, a wave slapped the container. One of the screens
    flickered.


    “I know everyone says it’s too late for big fixes,” Zara blurted. “That we just
    have to shrink everything and hope the platforms don’t break. But if there’s actual
    working ideas down there and we just sit here because I’m a kid—” Her throat felt
    tight. “That’s just… dumb. We can’t afford dumb.”


    Imani’s mouth twitched, not quite a smile. “You got a mouth on you.”


    “I can read a sign, you know,” Zara muttered.


    “Yeah, I see that.” Imani rubbed at the scar that cut through her left eyebrow,
    disappearing into her hairline. “Last time I chased a ‘game-changer’ down there,
    I lost two divers and half a rig when the facade collapsed. City called it ‘acceptable
    risk.’”


    She said the last two words like they tasted worse than rust.


    “So now you don’t go at all?” Zara asked, then winced. “I mean—”


    “Now,” Imani said curtly, “I don’t take kids on ghost hunts.”


    “But this isn’t a ghost,” Zara insisted. “It’s right there. You saw it. And the
    tides line up, and the storm track—”


    Imani’s gaze flicked to a screen showing a spiraling mass off the coast. “We get
    one clean shot before that cell brushes us. Tide window’s twenty-eight minutes.”
    She scowled at Zara. “You even know what that means?”


    “It means we have to be fast,” Zara said. Her palms were sweaty. “And careful.
    And you’re, like, the queen of careful, right?”


    Marco made a choking sound behind her, but Imani just snorted.


    “I’m the queen of not killing my crew for a maybe.” She stared at the tablet again'

    her throat. “Captain? It’s important.”


    Imani glanced up. Her eyes were sharp as fishhooks under a mess of gray-streaked
    braids tied back with copper wire. “You’re blocking my light, kid.”


    Zara sidestepped. “I found something in the Shallows. A pre-flood archive. Clean
    energy research. The—”


    Imani snorted. “You ‘found’ it with your toy drone?”


    “It’s not a toy,” Zara said, heat burning in her cheeks. “I fixed the depth sensors
    myself. Just—look.”


    She held out the tablet. Imani sighed like she was allergic to enthusiasm, but
    she took it. Zara watched her eyes move as she scrubbed through the footage.


    When the glowing words appeared, Imani paused. Her jaw tightened.


    “Could be a reflection. Junk on the glass. Algae.”


    “It’s a sign behind a door,” Zara said. “The seal’s not totally wrecked. We won’t
    know unless we go.”


    Imani didn’t answer. Outside, a wave slapped the container. One of the screens
    flickered.


    “I know everyone says it’s too late for big fixes,” Zara blurted. “That we just
    have to shrink everything and hope the platforms don’t break. But if there’s actual
    working ideas down there and we just sit here because I’m a kid—” Her throat felt
    tight. “That’s just… dumb. We can’t afford dumb.”


    Imani’s mouth twitched, not quite a smile. “You got a mouth on you.”


    “I can read a sign, you know,” Zara muttered.


    “Yeah, I see that.” Imani rubbed at the scar that cut through her left eyebrow,
    disappearing into her hairline. “Last time I chased a ‘game-changer’ down there,
    I lost two divers and half a rig when the facade collapsed. City called it ‘acceptable
    risk.’”


    She said the last two words like they tasted worse than rust.


    “So now you don’t go at all?” Zara asked, then winced. “I mean—”


    “Now,” Imani said curtly, “I don’t take kids on ghost hunts.”


    “But this isn’t a ghost,” Zara insisted. “It’s right there. You saw it. And the
    tides line up, and the storm track—”


    Imani’s gaze flicked to a screen showing a spiraling mass off the coast. “We get
    one clean shot before that cell brushes us. Tide window’s twenty-eight minutes.”
    She scowled at Zara. “You even know what that means?”


    “It means we have to be fast,” Zara said. Her palms were sweaty. “And careful.
    And you’re, like, the queen of careful, right?”


    Marco made a choking sound behind her, but Imani just snorted.


    “I’m the queen of not killing my crew for a maybe.” She stared at the tablet again.
    “The angle’s tight. Debris everywhere. One bad bump and the whole face could come
    down.”


    Zara swallowed. “What if you didn’t have to send a person in first?”


    Imani raised an eyebrow.


    Zara took a breath. “Sweepy’s small. I can fly it through the gap on a tether,
    snag what we need, and if stuff collapses, we just lose the drone. Not a diver.”


    Imani eyed her. “You built that thing out of trash.”


    “Good trash,” Zara said quickly. “And I tested the grabber. It can pull up a full
    battery pack. I’ll go on the rig, not in the water. You can cut the line if it
    gets'

  Zara spat over the rail and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. Below her,
  the old city lay drowned and crooked, glass teeth of towers poking out of the gray-green
  water. Waves slapped at the stilts of Dock 12, leaving trails of faintly glowing
  algae.


  “Come on, come on…” she muttered, tightening the last strap on her latest invention.


  The gull-drone shivered in her hands, a patchwork bird of carbon-fiber wings, soda-can
  feathers, and a cracked camera eye she’d scavenged from an old security bot. The
  belly was a waterproofed lunchbox with a coil of wire and a bright orange balloon
  vacuum-sealed inside.


  “It’s not gonna fly itself, Zee,” her older brother Marco called. He wore his usual
  expression—half worried, half annoyed. “Mom’s gonna fry us if she finds out you’re
  up here again.”


  “Relax,” Zara said. “This is actual science. You like food, right?”


  “I liked it better when you didn’t nearly set the kitchen on fire melting plastic.”


  “That was one time.”


  She stepped onto the bent solar panel she used as a launch pad and held the gull-drone
  up. Wind tugged at her braids, bringing the cold, wet smell of the open Atlantic.
  Beyond the maze of floating platforms and stacked shipping containers, the storm
  wall hummed low on the horizon.


  “Okay, Sweepy,” she whispered. “Find us something that’s not slime and disappointment.”


  She thumbed the starter. The mismatched rotors coughed, then spun up with a whining
  buzz. She tossed it into the air.


  For a terrifying second, the gull-drone dipped, one wing catching a gust. It skidded
  sideways over the drop to the Shallows.


  “Come on, come on, come on,” she hissed.


  Then the stabilizer fins—bits of umbrella ribs she’d re-angled—snapped open, and
  Sweepy leveled out. It climbed, wobbling but holding, and zipped off toward the
  glittering slick where the tide brought in trash.


  “Ha!” Zara punched the air.


  Marco let out a breath. “Okay, not gonna lie. That was sort of cool.”


  “Sort of?” She handed him the cracked tablet linked to the drone. “You’re on nav.
  Don’t let Sweepy kiss any buoys this time.”


  He rolled his eyes but took the tablet. Onscreen, a jerky bird’s-eye view of the
  floating city appeared: rafts of plastic, rusted platforms, greenhouses covered
  in patchwork glass. Barges below them were stacked with sorted scrap—metal one way,
  plastics another—kids their age hauling bins for credits.


  They skimmed Sweepy over the tide-lines where salvage sometimes got stuck. Zara
  watched the feed hungrily: broken chairs, drifting nets, plastic barrels headed
  for the reclaimers.


  Then something strange flickered in the corner of the screen.


  “Wait, back up,” she said.


  Marco thumbed the controls. The image swung, blurred, then focused.


  Below the surface, between two leaning skyscrapers, something glowed. Not the blue
  smear of algae. A steady rectangle of light, like a sign turned on underwater.


  “Is that… a building light?” Marco said. “There’s no power down there.”


  “Not from the grid,” Zara whispered. Her chest did a weird flutter. “Zoom in.”


  The glow sharpened into letters, ghostly behind a cracked glass wall.


  BOSTON CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH ARCHIVE.


  Zara made a sound between a gasp and a laugh. Her brain went fizzy, full of half-formed
  pictures—fixed water filters, solid platforms, lights that didn’t blink out in storms.
  “That’s… that’s huge.”


  “If it’s even real,” Marco said. But there was a tiny spark in his eyes now.


  “Look at the gap.” She jabbed the screen. “See? At dead low tide, it’s almost clear.
  We could get a crew down there. Real divers. Winches. That place could have better
  everything.”


  “Zee, it’s under the Shallows. Probably just mud and eels.”


  “Or not.” Her heart thudded. “We don’t know. That’s the point.”


  “Mom can’t even get extra rations for her class,” Marco said. “And you think she
  can pull a dive team out of nowhere?”


  “Not Mom.” Zara unhooked the tablet. “Harbor Authority. Captain Imani.”


  Marco snorted. “The Rust Queen? She doesn’t listen to anybody. Especially not kids.”


  “She doesn’t hate kids. She hates stupid ideas.” Zara felt a grin tug at her mouth.
  “So we’ll bring her a smart one.”


  “You’re twelve,” Marco said flatly. “They’ll say it’s a glitch and send you home.”


  The words hit like a slap. Zara’s jaw clenched before she could stop it. Heat crawled
  up her neck. “Then I’ll make sure they can’t,” she said, voice steadier than she
  felt. “Come with me?”


  He hesitated, then shrugged. “You’re gonna go anyway.”

  Captain Imani’s office was a shipping container welded to three others, all slanting
  at slightly different angles. The whole structure creaked when the waves hit.


  Inside smelled like salt, coffee, and hot circuitry. Screens lined one wall, showing
  tide patterns, platform stresses, storm wall diagnostics. Captain Imani herself
  hunched over a desk overflowing with parts.


  Zara waited until the woman finished swearing at a reluctant bolt before clearing
  her throat. “Captain? It’s important.”


  Imani glanced up. Her eyes were sharp as fishhooks under a mess of gray-streaked
