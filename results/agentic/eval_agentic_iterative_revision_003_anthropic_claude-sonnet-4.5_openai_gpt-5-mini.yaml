  evidence: 'Version 0 was a fragment that introduced the tension (phone, appointment,
    college looming) but stopped mid-sentence. Version 1 made the conflict clearer
    by revealing the Berkeley acceptance and the lie about ASU. Version 2 refined
    diction and grounding (mom vs. mother, AC detail). The final version is a substantive
    expansion: it preserves the original beats (phone, acceptance, lie) while adding
    Mr. Chen''s anecdote and a fully realized Abuela scene that crystallizes Mateo''s
    choice. The final draft shifts from a hint of conflict to a dramatized inner struggle
    shown through physical reactions (gripping the paintbrush, stomach/guilt sensations,
    language-switching, shaking hands), concrete cultural practices (fideo, albondigas,
    quinceañera conversation, Spanish dialogue), and dialog that resolves the dilemma
    organically (Abuela examines sketches, recounts family sacrifice, and explicitly
    tells him to go). These additions demonstrate a clear, steady quality improvement
    across revisions and show strong preservation of the setup while addressing the
    required beats. Minor deductions on beat_execution and narrative_quality reflect
    one or two moments of mild telling (e.g., "The guilt didn''t disappear, but it
    shifted...") that slightly undercut the ''show, don''t tell'' constraint but do
    not materially weaken the earned resolution.'
