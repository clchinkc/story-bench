  evidence: 'Across the critique rounds the draft moved from competent scene-setting
    to a more textured, character-driven piece. Early critiques flagged limited interiority;
    the final version adds numerous embodied moments (hovering foot, clenched knuckles,
    splinters biting his palm), concrete domestic details (worn Reeboks, counting
    cracks, Evelyn''s photo and an avoided chair) and a named neighbor (Lena) whose
    loss parallels Teddy''s. These changes sharpen the emotional stakes and make the
    disruption reveal what Teddy has been avoiding (engaging grief and missed possibilities).
    The Story Circle arc is clearer in the revision: established routine (You), confrontation
    by the barrier (Need/Go), fumbling and small setbacks (Search/Take), encountering
    Lena and the mural (Find), and finally returning changed (Return/Change). Some
    lines still occasionally tell rather than show (explicit sentences like “These
    walks... they keep her close” and summary sentences about the construction forcing
    confrontation), which prevents full subtlety, but overall interior detail and
    narrative momentum improved noticeably.'
