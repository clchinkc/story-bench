  evidence: 'Across revisions the author reduced florid, adult-sounding metaphors
    and clarified Zara''s tangible inventions (homemade goggles, flotation device)
    and the physical danger of the sea crossing. Version 0 opened with overtly adult
    phrasing (e.g., ''a floating testament to human resilience and folly'') noted
    in criticisms; subsequent versions softened that language and emphasized physical
    details and action. The mentor''s specific flaw (past failure / loss of confidence)
    was preserved and even dramatized (Elara freezes during the wave). The core beats
    (call to adventure via the map, adult dismissal, flawed mentor, dangerous crossing,
    discovery, return with hope) remained present throughout. Remaining issues: narrative
    voice still mixes childlike actions and dialogue with occasional elevated descriptions
    (''a city of floating platforms and cobbled-together dreams''), which keeps youth_voice
    from fully resolving the critiques (consistent with the prior scores ~0.60–0.68).
    The revisions therefore show clear improvement in danger, stakes, and concrete
    inventions, but only partial remediation of the youth-voice mismatch.'
