  content: 'The swamp cooler in Abuela’s trailer rattled like it was coughing up pennies.
    Mateo stood at the kitchen counter, turning the envelope over and over until the
    paper warmed in his fingers. Outside, the late-June sun bleached the gravel yard
    and the strip mall across the street—Dollar General, a closed vape shop, a panadería
    that opened only on weekends—until everything looked a little tired.


    “¿Qué dice?” Abuela asked from the table. She had her rosary wrapped around two
    fingers, the beads clicking softly against her chipped mug.


    Mateo slid the envelope behind the stack of utility bills. “It’s nothing, Abuela.
    Just—school.”


    He pushed her glasses up her nose and leaned over the forms anyway, because that
    was what he did: translated, balanced, fixed. The clinic letter about her appointment.
    The landlord’s note about the air conditioner. The phone call from his little
    sister’s teacher. His voice changed automatically when he spoke for other people—careful
    English for the world, gentle Spanish for home.


    His phone buzzed with a text from his manager: *Need you 4-close today. José called
    out.*


    Mateo stared at the screen until the letters blurred. He typed, erased, typed
    again. *Ok* was the easiest word in two languages.


    The envelope under the bills felt heavier than paper.


    At the high school library later, the air-conditioning hit him like cold water.
    Ms. Anderson, the counselor, had her sleeves rolled up and a small fan on her
    desk anyway. Mateo slid into the chair across from her, keeping his backpack tight
    against his legs.


    “You asked for me,” she said, and waited. She was one of the few adults who didn’t
    fill silence with advice.


    Mateo took the envelope out and placed it on her desk, like evidence. The seal
    was already broken; the letter inside had crease marks from being folded and unfolded.
    Ms. Anderson read, her eyes moving quickly.


    “ASU,” she said. “Summer program. Full scholarship.”


    Mateo nodded once, sharp. The program started in two weeks. Six weeks in Tempe.
    Dorms. Engineering labs. People who said his name without rolling the r.


    Ms. Anderson looked up. “You haven’t told your family.”


    Mateo’s thumbnail worried the edge of the letter until it frayed. “My mom already
    made a list,” he said, the words coming out clipped. “How much I can work this
    summer. How much to save. For Abuela’s meds. For my sister’s quince deposit. She
    says senior year will be expensive.”


    He didn’t say *and I’m the one who makes the list work*. He tapped the paper instead,
    like it could speak for him. “If I go, I can’t work. I can’t drive Abuela to the
    clinic. I can’t—” He stopped when his throat tightened, swallowed, and turned
    the feeling into a small shrug.


    Ms. Anderson didn’t flinch. “You can love them and still go,” she said. “Those
    things aren’t opposites.”


    Mateo’s laugh came out wrong. “In my house they are.”


    That evening, the heat in the trailer clung to skin and breath. His mother was
    still at her shift at the motel; his sister was at dance practice. Abuela sat
    on the porch steps with a bowl of watermelon, spitting seeds into her palm like
    tiny decisions.


    Mateo carried out a glass of water and sat beside her. The metal step burned through
    his jeans.


    Abuela offered him a wedge. “Come,” she said.


    He took it, chewed without tasting. The scholarship letter was in his pocket,
    corners digging into his thigh.


    Across the street, the panadería sign flickered on and off. A truck rumbled by,
    trailing dust.


    Abuela watched the road, then turned her eyes on him. “Traes algo aquí,” she said,
    tapping his chest with one knuckle. “You’re holding it in.”


    Mateo’s fingers went numb around the watermelon rind. He pulled the letter out
    and held it between them. The paper fluttered in the hot breeze.


    Abuela took her glasses, put them on, and held the page close. Her lips moved
    as she sounded out the English, slow and stubborn. Mateo waited, his stomach a
    tight fist.


    When she finished, her hand stayed on the paper. “Tempe,” she said, as if tasting
    the word. Then, softer: “Es lejos.”


    “Yeah.” Mateo stared at the gravel, at the cracks where weeds fought up. “I can’t
    go. I have work. And your appointments. And—”


    Abuela’s hand reached out and gripped his wrist, surprisingly strong. The rosary
    beads dug into his skin. “Mijo,” she said, and the syllable carried years of him
    translating, of him being steady. “Yo crucé más lejos que Tempe.”


    He looked up.


    Her eyes were wet but sharp. “I didn’t come here so you could stay small for me.”
    She pressed the letter back into his palm. “Me ayudas mucho. Pero no eres mi esposo.
    No eres mi papá. Eres un niño… pero también ya eres un hombre.”


    Mateo’s breath hitched. He blinked hard, once, twice, and the desert sky went
    hazy at the edges.


    He didn’t answer with words. He stood, walked inside, and pulled out the calendar
    on the fridge. The one with Virgen de Guadalupe printed above the dates. His hand
    shook as he uncapped the pen.


    When his mother came home, tired and smelling like bleach, Mateo didn’t fold himself
    into the doorway to soften the news. He set the scholarship letter on the table,
    next to the bills, and stayed standing.


    “I got in,” he said. His voice wavered, then steadied. “It’s paid for. I want
    to go.”


    His mother’s face tightened, reflex like a door locking. Then she saw Abuela at
    the table, rosary in hand, watching without pleading.


    Ms. Anderson’s words echoed in Mateo’s head—*love and go*—and he held his ground,
    hands open, not apologizing.


    His mother exhaled through her nose, long. “¿Y el trabajo?” she asked.


    Mateo swallowed. “I talked to Mr. Patel. He’ll keep my hours when I’m back. I
    set up rides for Abuela—Mrs. Salinas said yes on Tuesdays. I wrote the clinic
    number in Spanish next to the phone.” He slid a paper across the table, his careful
    handwriting listing names, times, favors owed. Not a promise to do everything.
    A plan that made space for him.


    His mother read without looking at him. When she finished, she pressed the paper
    flat with her palm. The room was so quiet Mateo could hear the swamp cooler’s
    rattle.


    Finally, she reached out and touched the edge of the scholarship letter like it
    might burn. “Tempe,” she said, and her voice cracked on the second syllable. “Está
    bien.”


    Mateo sat down, feeling the chair under him like permission. Outside, the desert
    held its heat, the strip mall lights flickered on, and for the first time all
    summer, he let the weight shift—not off his family, but off his shoulders.'

    Mateo stood at the kitchen counter, turning an envelope over and over until the
    paper warmed in his fingers. Outside, the late-June sun bleached the gravel yard
    and the aging strip mall across the street—Dollar General, a shuttered vape shop,
    a panadería that opened only on weekends—until everything looked a little tired.


    “¿Qué dice?” Abuela asked from the table. Her rosary was wrapped around two fingers,
    beads clicking softly against her chipped mug.


    Mateo’s hand jerked, quick as if the envelope had stung him. He slid it behind
    the stack of utility bills. “It’s nothing, Abuela. Just—school.”


    On the table were the things that always belonged to him: a clinic letter, a landlord
    note about the air conditioner, a scribbled reminder from his sister’s teacher.
    Mateo leaned in and translated anyway. His voice shifted automatically—careful
    English for the world, gentle Spanish for home—while his eyes kept flicking to
    the hidden envelope like it might crawl out on its own.


    His phone buzzed.


    *Need you 4-close today. José called out.* —Mr. Patel


    Mateo stared until the letters blurred, thumb hovering over the screen. He typed,
    erased, typed again, then sent the smallest surrender: *Ok.*


    The envelope behind the bills felt heavier than paper, and he kept hearing his
    mother’s voice from last night at the sink, counting out cash: “No podemos fallar
    este verano, Mateo. You’re the one I can count on.”


    At the high school library later, the air-conditioning hit him like cold water.
    Ms. Anderson, the counselor, had her sleeves rolled up and a small fan on her
    desk anyway. Mateo sat across from her with his backpack tight against his legs,
    like if he loosened his grip, something would spill out.


    “You asked for me,” she said, and waited. She was one of the few adults who didn’t
    patch silence with pep talks.


    Mateo pulled out the envelope and put it on her desk, like evidence. The seal
    was already broken; the letter inside had crease marks from being folded and unfolded
    at midnight.


    Ms. Anderson skimmed. “ASU,” she said. “Summer engineering program. Full scholarship.”


    Mateo nodded once, sharp. Two weeks. Six weeks in Tempe. Dorms and labs and people
    who didn’t ask him to translate a single thing.


    Ms. Anderson set the letter down carefully. “What’s stopping you?”


    Mateo’s thumbnail worried the edge of the paper until it frayed. He didn’t say
    *my family will tip over without me.* Instead, he opened his Notes app and tilted
    his phone toward her. A list: Abuela—clinic Tuesdays. Sister—dance practice rides.
    Rent due date circled. Utility bill amounts. Work schedule.


    The list went on too long to be normal.


    Ms. Anderson’s eyes softened, not pitying—recognizing. “You’ve built your whole
    life around holding it together,” she said. “And you’re scared that choosing yourself
    means dropping them.”


    Mateo’s jaw worked. A laugh tried to come out and failed. He shut his phone screen
    like it could hide him. “In my house,” he said, voice thin, “love is showing up.
    Every day.”


    “Love can also be letting people grow,” Ms. Anderson said. “And letting you grow.
    We can make a plan—rides, community resources, your job. But you have to decide
    you’re allowed to go.”


    That night, the heat clung to the trailer walls and to Mateo’s skin. His mother
    was still at her shift at the motel; his sister was at dance practice. Abuela
    sat on the porch steps with a bowl of watermelon, spitting seeds into her palm
    like tiny decisions.


    Mateo carried out a glass of water and sat beside her. The metal step burned through
    his jeans. The scholarship letter was in his pocket, corners digging into his
    thigh.


    Abuela watched the road, then turned her eyes on him. “Traes algo aquí,” she said,
    tapping his chest with one knuckle. “You’re holding it in.”


    Mateo’s fingers went numb around the watermelon rind. He pulled out the letter
    and held it between them. The paper fluttered in the hot breeze.


    Abuela put on her glasses and held the page close. Her lips moved as she sounded
    out the English, slow and stubborn. Mateo kept his eyes on her hands—brown, veined,
    the same hands that had taught him how to roll tortillas and how to count change
    twice.


    When she reached the word “scholarship,” her eyebrows lifted. She read the dates
    again, then looked up. “Tempe,” she said, tasting the word. “Es lejos.”


    Mateo’s throat tightened. He nodded, hard. He tried to speak like the responsible
    one, the translator, the fixer. “I can’t. I have work. I have your appointments.
    Mom needs—”


    Abuela’s hand shot out and caught his wrist. The rosary beads dug into his skin,
    an anchor and a warning. “Mijo,” she said, and there was steel in the tenderness.
    “Yo crucé más lejos que Tempe.”


    Mateo blinked.


    She tapped the letter with one fingernail. “I didn’t come here so you could stay
    small for me. Me ayudas mucho, sí. Pero no eres mi esposo. No eres mi papá.” Her
    grip tightened when his shoulders curled inward out of habit. “Eres mi nieto.
    You get to go.”


    The desert hummed—cicadas, far-off traffic, the strip mall sign buzzing on and
    off. Mateo’s breath hitched, and for a second he couldn’t make either language
    work. He looked at her wrist where the rosary rested, and then at his own wrist
    in her hand, and understood what she was offering: permission, not relief.


    He stood so fast the porch step scraped. Inside, he tore a sheet of notebook paper
    from his backpack and wrote without stopping—names, numbers, days. Mrs. Salinas
    for Tuesday rides. Ms. Anderson said there was a church fund for gas cards. His
    manager could hold his hours. The clinic had a Spanish line if Abuela needed to
    call. It wasn’t perfect. It was something he could hand over without handing over
    himself.


    When his mother came home, tired and smelling like bleach, Mateo didn’t meet her
    in the doorway to soften her day. He waited at the table with the letter and the
    plan laid out beside the bills.


    His mother’s eyes went first to the bills, then to his face, then to the ASU letter.
    “¿Qué es esto?” Her voice sharpened automatically, like when something threatened
    the fragile balance.


    Mateo’s hands shook. He kept them on the table so she could see he wasn’t backing
    away. “I got in,” he said. The words scraped out, then steadied as he repeated
    them. “It’s paid for. I want to go.”


    Silence snapped tight. His mother’s mouth opened, closed. Her gaze flicked to
    Abuela, who had sat down without Mateo noticing, rosary in hand like a quiet witness.


    “¿Y el trabajo?” his mother demanded, but the demand landed softer—more fear than
    anger.


    Mateo slid the plan forward. “Mr. Patel will keep my hours when I’m back,” he
    said, forcing himself not to rush. “Mrs. Salinas will take Abuela Tuesdays. I
    wrote everything in Spanish next to the phone. I talked to Ms. Anderson about
    resources.” He pointed, one item at a time, the way he pointed out vocabulary
    to Abuela. “I’m not leaving you with nothing.”


    His mother read, lips moving. The swamp cooler rattled; the clock ticked; a car
    passed outside. Mateo waited, shoulders burning from not folding, not apologizing.


    Finally, his mother pressed the paper flat with her palm. Her eyes shone, angry
    at shining. “Siempre has sido el responsable,” she said, voice breaking on the
    word like she didn’t know whether it was praise or a chain. She looked up at him.
    “¿Y si algo pasa?”


    Mateo swallowed, and the old answer—*I’ll handle it*—rose automatically. He let
    it sit there and die. “Then we handle it,” he said instead, and the plural felt
    like stepping onto new ground. “Not just me.”


    Abuela made a small sound of approval, almost a laugh.


    His mother stared at the scholarship letter again, then exhaled long through her
    nose, like letting go of a breath she’d been holding since before he was born.
    “Tempe,” she said, and her voice cracked on the second syllable. “Está bien. But
    you call. Every day.”


    Mateo nodded, once. He felt the chair under him when he sat, solid as if it had
    been waiting. Outside, the desert kept its heat, the strip mall lights flickered
    on, and the weight in the room didn’t vanish—just shifted, redistributed, finally
    shared.'

    Mateo stood at the kitchen counter, turning an envelope over and over until the
    paper warmed in his fingers. Outside, the late-June sun bleached the gravel yard
    and the aging strip mall across the street—Dollar General, a shuttered vape shop,
    a panadería that opened only on Saturdays, and the laundromat with the busted
    “N” so it read *Lau dromat*—until everything looked a little tired.


    “¿Qué dice?” Abuela asked from the table. Her rosary was wrapped around two fingers,
    beads clicking softly against her chipped mug. Next to her sat a bag of oranges
    and a bottle of Vicks, like a little altar to getting through the week.


    Mateo’s hand jerked as if the envelope had stung him. He slid it behind the stack
    of utility bills. “Nada, Abuela. Just school stuff.”


    On the table were the things that always landed on him: the clinic letter with
    appointment times in tiny print, a landlord note about the air conditioner “dripping
    again,” a sticky note from his sister’s teacher. Mateo pushed Abuela’s glasses
    higher and leaned in to translate. His voice shifted automatically—careful English
    for the world, gentle Spanish for home—while his eyes kept flicking to the hidden
    envelope like it might crawl out on its own.


    His phone buzzed.


    *Need you 4-close today. José called out.* —Mr. Patel


    Mateo stared until the letters blurred. His thumb hovered. He could almost hear
    his mom from last night at the sink, rinsing motel towels in the bathtub because
    the washer had broken again: “No podemos fallar este verano, Mateo. You’re the
    one I can count on.”


    He typed, erased, typed again, and sent the smallest surrender: *Ok.*


    The envelope behind the bills felt heavier than paper.


    At the high school library later, the air-conditioning hit him like cold water.
    Ms. Anderson, the counselor, had her sleeves rolled up and a small fan aimed at
    a stack of forms that kept trying to curl in the humidity.


    Mateo sat across from her with his backpack tight against his legs. He set the
    envelope on her desk, then immediately pulled his hands back, like it belonged
    to somebody else.


    “You asked for me,” she said, and waited. She was one of the only adults in town
    who didn’t talk at him like he was either a problem or a miracle.


    She read fast. “ASU,” she said. “Summer engineering program. Full scholarship.”


    Mateo nodded once. His knee bounced under the chair. Two weeks. Six weeks in Tempe.
    A dorm room. Labs. People who didn’t know he carried everybody’s passwords and
    everybody’s paperwork in his head.


    Ms. Anderson set the letter down. “You’re not excited.”


    Mateo’s thumbnail worried the edge of the paper until it frayed. He didn’t say
    *because if I leave, everything snaps.* He opened his Notes app instead and tilted
    it toward her.


    A list: Abuela—clinic Tuesdays. Sister—dance practice rides. Mom—mornings she
    can’t be late. Rent due date. Light bill. Water bill. Work schedule.


    It went on too long.


    Ms. Anderson’s eyes softened, not pitying—recognizing. “You’re doing the job of
    three people,” she said. “And if you go, you’re afraid they’ll think you chose
    yourself over them.”


    Mateo let out a short breath through his nose. “It’s not even about ‘think,’”
    he said, then stopped, annoyed with himself for sounding dramatic. He tried again,
    smaller. “If I’m not there, stuff just…doesn’t happen.”


    “That’s real,” she said, like she believed him. “But it doesn’t mean you don’t
    go. It means we plan, and you ask for help—out loud. You don’t have to do it like
    a one-man crew.”


    Mateo stared at the scholarship letter until the words blurred. Asking for help
    felt like handing someone a glass and hoping they wouldn’t drop it.


    That evening, the heat clung to the trailer walls and to Mateo’s skin. His mom
    was still at her shift at the motel; his sister was at dance practice, the kind
    where they practiced smiling while their feet hurt. Abuela sat on the porch steps
    with a bowl of watermelon, spitting seeds into her palm like tiny decisions.


    Mateo carried out a glass of water and sat beside her. The metal step burned through
    his jeans. The scholarship letter was in his pocket, corners digging into his
    thigh.


    Abuela watched the road, then tapped his chest with one knuckle. “Traes algo aquí,”
    she said. “You’re holding it in.”


    Mateo’s fingers went numb around the watermelon rind. He pulled the letter out
    and held it between them. The paper fluttered in the hot breeze.


    Abuela put on her glasses and held the page close. Her lips moved as she sounded
    out the English, slow and stubborn. Mateo watched her mouth, the way she fought
    with each word like it owed her something.


    When she reached the dates, her eyebrows lifted. “Tempe,” she said, tasting the
    word. “Es lejos.”


    “Yeah.” Mateo stared at the gravel, at the weeds pushing through the cracks. His
    mouth went dry. “I can’t. I have work. And your appointments. And my mom—”


    Abuela’s hand shot out and caught his wrist. The rosary beads dug into his skin,
    familiar as a warning from someone who loved him. “Mijo,” she said, and her voice
    carried the same tone she used when he tried to pay for her groceries with his
    own money. “Yo crucé más lejos que Tempe.”


    Mateo looked up.


    Her eyes were wet, but sharp. “I didn’t come here so you could stay small for
    me,” she said, switching into English on purpose, making each word land. “You
    help me a lot. Pero no eres mi esposo. No eres el papá de tu hermana.” She squeezed
    his wrist. “Eres mi nieto. You get to go learn.”


    Mateo’s throat tightened. He blinked hard, once, and his eyes burned anyway. He
    nodded, because if he spoke, it was going to come out messy.


    Inside, he grabbed a sheet of notebook paper and started writing like his life
    depended on it. Names, numbers, days. Mrs. Salinas from church could take Abuela
    Tuesdays—she’d offered before and Mateo had smiled and said *no, it’s fine* like
    it was a reflex. He wrote the clinic’s Spanish line in big letters. He wrote “Mr.
    Patel—hold hours?” with a question mark that looked like a hook.


    When his mother came home, tired and smelling like bleach and motel coffee, Mateo
    didn’t jump up to take her keys or ask if she’d eaten. He sat at the table with
    the bills, the scholarship letter, and his paper plan spread out like a map.


    His mom’s eyes went to the bills first. Then the letter. Then his face. “¿Qué
    es esto?” Her voice sharpened, the way it did when the car made a new noise.


    Mateo’s hands shook, so he flattened them on the tabletop. “I got in,” he said.
    His voice cracked, and he hated that it did. He tried again. “It’s paid for. I
    want to go.”


    Silence snapped tight. His mother’s mouth opened like she was going to say *we
    can’t*, then closed when she saw Abuela at the table too, rosary in hand, watching
    without flinching.


    “¿Y el trabajo?” his mom asked. It wasn’t anger first—it was math.


    Mateo slid the paper toward her. “Mr. Patel said he can keep my spot if I come
    back in August,” he said. “Mrs. Salinas will drive Abuela Tuesdays. I wrote everything
    down in Spanish by the phone. Ms. Anderson said there are gas cards through the
    community center if we need them.” He pointed, line by line, the way he pointed
    out English words for Abuela. “I’m not leaving you with nothing.”


    His mom read, lips moving. Her tiredness shifted into something like grief and
    pride fighting in the same space. “Siempre has sido el responsable,” she said,
    and it didn’t sound like a compliment.


    Mateo swallowed. The old answer—*I’ll handle it*—rose up automatically. He let
    it sit there, then pushed it away. “I can’t be the only plan,” he said, quieter
    than he meant. Then, because he was sixteen and scared and still trying, he added,
    “I’ll call every day. I’m not disappearing. I just—” He pressed his thumb against
    the frayed edge of the scholarship letter. “I want to try.”


    His mom stared at the page again, then at him, like she was seeing the kid she’d
    been leaning on. She exhaled long through her nose. “Tempe,” she said, and her
    voice cracked on the second syllable. “Está bien. Pero me avisas cuando llegues.
    And you call.”


    Mateo nodded once. He sat back, feeling the chair under him like permission. Outside,
    the desert held its heat, the strip mall lights flickered on, and for the first
    time all summer, the weight in the room shifted—still there, still real, but not
    all on him.'

    The swamp cooler in Abuela’s trailer rattled like it was coughing up pennies.
    Mateo stood at the kitchen counter, turning an envelope over and over until the
    paper warmed in his fingers. Outside, the late-June sun bleached the gravel yard
    and the aging strip mall across the street—Dollar General, a shuttered vape shop,
    a panadería that opened only on Saturdays, and the laundromat with the busted
    “N” so it read *Lau dromat*—until everything looked a little tired.


    “¿Qué dice?” Abuela asked from the table. Her rosary was wrapped around two fingers,
    beads clicking softly against her chipped mug. Next to her sat a bag of oranges
    and a bottle of Vicks, like a little altar to getting through the week.


    Mateo’s hand jerked as if the envelope had stung him. He slid it behind the stack
    of utility bills. “Nada, Abuela. Just school stuff.”


    On the table were the things that always landed on him: the clinic letter with
    appointment times in tiny print, a landlord note about the air conditioner “dripping
    again,” a sticky note from his sister’s teacher. Mateo pushed Abuela’s glasses
    higher and leaned in to translate. His voice shifted automatically—careful English
    for the world, gentle Spanish for home—while his eyes kept flicking to the hidden
    envelope like it might crawl out on its own.


    His phone buzzed.


    *Need you 4-close today. José called out.* —Mr. Patel


    Mateo stared until the letters blurred. His thumb hovered. He could almost hear
    his mom from last night at the sink, rinsing motel towels in the bathtub because
    the washer had broken again: “No podemos fallar este verano, Mateo. You’re the
    one I can count on.”


    He typed, erased, typed again, and sent the smallest surrender: *Ok.*


    The envelope behind the bills felt heavier than paper.


    At the high school library later, the air-conditioning hit him like cold water.
    Ms. Anderson, the counselor, had her sleeves rolled up and a small fan aimed at
    a stack of forms that kept trying to curl in the humidity.

    He typed, erased, typed again, and sent the smallest surrender: *Ok.*


    The envelope behind the bills felt heavier than paper.


    At the high school library later, the air-conditioning hit him like cold water.
    Ms. Anderson, the counselor, had her sleeves rolled up and a small fan aimed at
    a stack of forms that kept trying to curl in the humidity.


    Mateo sat across from her with his backpack tight against his legs. He set the
    envelope on her desk, then pulled his hands back like it belonged to somebody
    else.


    “You asked for me,” she said, and waited. She was one of the only adults in town
    who didn’t talk at him like he was either a problem or a miracle.


    She read fast. “ASU,” she said. “Summer engineering program. Full scholarship.”


    Mateo nodded once. His knee bounced under the chair, fast enough to make the desk
    tremble. Two weeks. Six weeks in Tempe. A dorm room. Labs. No one asking him to
    call the pharmacy and argue about refills.


    Ms. Anderson set the letter down. “What’s the catch?”


    Mateo’s mouth opened and shut. He pulled out his phone instead and tilted it toward
    her.


    A list: Abuela—clinic Tuesdays. Sister—dance practice rides. Mom—mornings she
    can’t be late. Rent due date. Light bill. Water bill. Work schedule.


    It went on too long.


    Ms. Anderson didn’t look impressed. She looked concerned, like she’d finally been
    shown the underside of something she’d suspected. “You’re doing the job of three
    people,” she said. “And if you go, you’re afraid that makes you selfish.”


    Mateo pressed his thumbnail into the corner of the scholarship letter until it
    hurt. Pain was clean; the feeling underneath wasn’t. “If I don’t do it,” he said,
    voice low, “it doesn’t get done.”


    “That’s a lot to put on a kid,” Ms. Anderson said. She slid a blank sheet of paper
    toward him. “Let’s make a real plan. Not a ‘Mateo will handle it’ plan.”


    He stared at the blank page, throat tight. He nodded anyway, once, like he was
    agreeing to jump off something high.


    That evening, the heat clung to the trailer walls and to Mateo’s skin. His mom
    was still at her shift at the motel; his sister was at dance practice. Abuela
    sat on the porch steps with a bowl of watermelon, spitting seeds into her palm
    like tiny decisions.


    Mateo carried out a glass of water and sat beside her. The metal step burned through
    his jeans. The scholarship letter was in his pocket, corners digging into his
    thigh.


    Across the street, the panadería sign flickered. Somewhere down the block, a dog
    barked until someone yelled its name. The town’s sounds always felt like they
    were too close, like there wasn’t room to have your own thoughts without everyone
    hearing.


    Abuela looked at him sideways. “No has comido,” she said, like it was an accusation.


    “I ate,” Mateo lied automatically, then hated how easy the lie was. He wiped his
    palms on his shorts. Sweat made everything stick—skin, fabric, obligations.


    Abuela tapped his chest with one knuckle. “Traes algo aquí.”


    Mateo’s fingers went numb around the watermelon rind. He pulled the letter out
    and held it between them. The paper fluttered in the hot breeze, eager as if it
    wanted to escape his hands.


    Abuela put on her glasses. She read slowly, sounding out the English like she
    was chewing it. When she got stuck, Mateo didn’t jump in. He held his breath and
    let her fight through it. Her pride was a separate thing from his responsibility,
    and he realized he’d been mixing them up for years.


    When she reached the dates, her eyebrows lifted. “Tempe,” she said. “Es lejos.”


    “Yeah.” Mateo stared at the gravel, at the weeds pushing through the cracks. His
    chest felt packed tight. “I can’t go.”


    Abuela lowered the paper. “¿Por qué?” Not angry. Just direct.


    Mateo tried to line up reasons the way he lined up bills. “Work needs me. You
    need me. My mom—” His voice snagged on the last one. He pressed his tongue to
    his teeth hard enough to taste metal. “If I’m not here, she has to be the bad
    guy. She has to ask people for favors. She hates that.”


    Abuela’s hand reached out and took his wrist, not gentle, not harsh—certain. The
    rosary beads dug into his skin. Mateo flinched and then stilled, because her grip
    was familiar: the same grip from when he was little and tried to run into a parking
    lot.


    “Mijo,” she said. “Mírame.”


    He looked.


    Her eyes were wet, but sharp. “Yo sé lo que es cargar la casa,” she said. “Your
    mamá learned to survive by not needing anyone. That’s not the same as being strong.”


    Mateo swallowed. He wanted to argue, wanted to protect his mom the way he always
    did, by making her choices sound reasonable. But Abuela kept going.


    “When I crossed,” she said, “I didn’t tell my mamá. Not because I was brave. Porque
    tenía vergüenza. I was ashamed to ask for help. I thought if I asked, it meant
    I didn’t deserve to go.” She tapped the scholarship letter. “You deserve to go.”


    Mateo’s eyes burned. He blinked fast, angry at his own face for betraying him.
    Abuela’s thumb rubbed once over his wrist, right where the rosary pressed, and
    the simple gesture cracked something open.


    “And listen,” she added, softer, almost teasing, “I am not a porcelana. I can
    take a ride from Mrs. Salinas. I can wait in the clinic without you explaining
    every word. I will manage.” Her voice hardened for a second. “But you have to
    let me. You have to stop making yourself the only bridge.”


    Mateo let out a shaky breath that was almost a laugh and almost a sob. He looked
    down at the letter. The paper wasn’t heavy anymore. His pocket had been.


    Inside, he grabbed a sheet of notebook paper and started writing, but this time
    he didn’t write like a hero making a secret plan. He wrote like someone building
    a net with other hands.


    He wrote: *Call Mrs. Salinas—ask.* *Ask Ms. Anderson about rides.* *Teach Abuela
    how to press “1” for Spanish line.* The word *ask* showed up again and again,
    and each time it made his stomach twist.


    When his mother came home, tired and smelling like bleach and motel coffee, Mateo
    didn’t jump up to take her keys. He sat at the table with the bills, the scholarship
    letter, and the paper plan. Abuela sat too, rosary in hand, like she was backing
    him up without making it a fight.


    His mom’s eyes went to the bills first. Then the letter. Then his face. “¿Qué
    es esto?” Her voice sharpened on reflex, the way it did when the car made a new
    noise.


    Mateo’s hands shook, so he flattened them on the tabletop. “I got in,” he said.
    The words came out rough. “It’s paid for. I want to go.”


    His mom’s face tightened. Mateo watched her do the math in her head—the hours,
    the rides, the shame of asking, the risk of things slipping. For a second, he
    saw something childlike behind her irritation: fear.


    “¿Y el trabajo?” she asked, and the question was both practical and pleading—*don’t
    make me be the one who can’t handle it.*
