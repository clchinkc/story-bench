output: 'The soot on Elian’s face could not hide the terror in his eyes. Outside the
  heavy oak doors of the forge, the Kingdom of Aethelgard screamed. The Eternal Night
  had finally descended, a suffocating fog filled with chittering horrors that turned
  men to ash.


  Inside, the heat was blistering. Hrothgar, the kingdom’s greatest smith, leaned
  heavily on his cane, his breathing ragged.


  "Strike, boy! Harder!" Hrothgar barked, though his voice lacked its usual thunder.


  Elian brought the hammer down on the slab of Star-metal. It was the only material
  capable of holding the sun’s light, but it was cold, stubborn, and refused to take
  an edge. "It’s no use, Master! It won''t shape. It fights me."


  "It fights you because you treat it like iron," Hrothgar wheezed. "It requires a
  will stronger than the darkness outside."


  This was the Call. The King’s guard had fallen. The walls were breached. Only the
  *Sola Ferrum*—the Sun Blade—could cleave the shadows. Hrothgar had spent a lifetime
  searching for the ore, but his hands were now too gnarled to work it. The prophecy
  was clear: the apprentice must forge the masterwork, and the apprentice must wield
  it.


  Elian wiped sweat from his brow. "I am not ready. You should be the one holding
  the hammer."


  "There is no time for doubt," Hrothgar said, his eyes locking onto Elian’s. "Cross
  the threshold of your fear. You are no longer a boy pumping bellows. Today, you
  are a maker of gods."


  Elian nodded, gritting his teeth. He thrust the metal back into the white-hot coals.
  He worked with a rhythm meant to drown out the scratching of shadow-claws against
  the forge door. He folded the steel, once, twice, a dozen times. He poured his stamina
  into the metal until his arms screamed.


  Yet, when he pulled the blade from the fire to quench it, the metal remained a dull,
  lifeless grey. It held no light.


  The door hinges groaned. The wood splintered. The shadows were breaking in.


  "It’s not working!" Elian cried, panic seizing his chest. "The magic... it won''t
  take. It needs a catalyst."


  Hrothgar looked at the dull blade, then at the door, and finally at Elian. A sad,
  knowing smile touched the old man''s lips. "Aye. It does."


  "What do we need? Dragon’s blood? Diamond dust?"


  "A soul, Elian. A master’s soul to guide the steel." Hrothgar stepped closer to
  the anvil, casting aside his cane. He stood tall, the frailty vanishing for a fleeting
  moment. "The final quenching must be done not in water, nor oil."


  Elian froze, the hammer trembling in his hand. He understood. The old texts spoke
  of great power requiring a terrible price. "No. I won''t do it."


  "You must," Hrothgar commanded, his voice soft but unyielding. "The darkness is
  here. If you do not strike, everyone dies. Including me. Make my death count, lad."


  The door exploded inward. Tendrils of black smoke lashed out, extinguishing the
  torches. The only light remaining was the fading glow of the cooling metal.


  "Now, Elian! Forge your destiny!" Hrothgar stepped between the boy and the darkness,
  opening his arms, exposing his chest. "Quench the blade!"


  Tears blinded Elian. The Ordeal was not fighting the monster; it was losing the
  father he had found in the ash. With a scream that tore his throat, Elian thrust
  the glowing blade forward.


  He drove the steel through Hrothgar’s heart.


  There was no blood, only a blinding flash of golden light. Hrothgar’s body dissolved
  into pure energy, swirling into the metal. The grey steel drank the essence, turning
  a brilliant, burning white. The heat was no longer from the fire, but from the blade
  itself.


  Elian drew the weapon back. He stood alone in the forge, the weight of the sword
  perfectly balanced, humming with his master’s spirit.


  He stepped over the threshold, out into the night. He raised the blade, and for
  the first time in a month, the sun rose—right from his hand.'
