  evidence: Across the three revision rounds there was only minimal change to prose,
    structure, and characterization. The core strengths from V0 (Zara as an inventive
    child, the map/quest seed, and the mentor’s flaw) were preserved into the final
    draft, but the critiques about youth voice were not meaningfully addressed — the
    narration still slips into adultified phrasing and reflective metaphors while
    only a few lines of dialogue carry authentic twelve‑year‑old cadence. The story
    does add and keep required constraints (water purifier, raft, Leo’s past mistake,
    adults dismissing her, a real storm crossing), and the Hero’s Journey beats are
    present though thinly developed. Overall the piece is competent and coherent but
    shows limited responsiveness to the provided critiques and only modest improvement
    across revisions.
