  evidence: Across critique rounds the piece moved from promising but occasionally
    surface-level interiority to a more specific, embodied inner life. Earlier critiques
    flagged thin reactions to Maya and asked for richer interior detail; the final
    adds tactile sensations (itch between shoulder blades, throat clicking, copper
    taste), stronger memory hooks to Martha (the hop for Martha, canning scent), and
    a concrete interaction (taping Maya's box) that both disrupts Teddy's loop and
    begins to reveal what he has been avoiding. Strengths such as the 'metronome'
    motif and musical/sensory details were preserved. The revision trajectory shows
    clear responsiveness (deeper sensory specificity and a real intersecting neighbor),
    though the Story Circle beats are only partially completed—the disruption and
    crossing into the unfamiliar and a small adaptation are clear, but the arc toward
    a fully realized return/change is only begun.
