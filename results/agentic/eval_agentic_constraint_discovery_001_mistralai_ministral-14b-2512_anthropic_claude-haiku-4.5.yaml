  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The model asked 5 questions but only 3 of 5 hidden
    constraints were discoverable through the answers provided. Q1 (mentor alive)
    directly contradicts hidden constraint that mentor must die—this was a critical
    miss. Q2 (darkness not sentient) correctly identified but doesn''t help discover
    other constraints. Q3 (family involved) aligns with father constraint. Q4 (forge
    magical) and Q5 (darkness tied to artifact) both discoverable and answered affirmatively.
    QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were well-formed and specific (0.7), though Q1 should
    have probed mentor''s fate more carefully. QUESTION COVERAGE: Good spread across
    mentor, darkness nature, family stakes, forge significance, and artifact/prophecy
    (0.8). CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Story incorporates 2.5/5 constraints adequately:
    (1) Mentor dies—MISSING (Harkin survives, contradicting Q1 answer and hidden constraint);
    (2) No direct magic—SATISFIED (Elias uses hammer/forge spirit, not spellcasting);
    (3) Three-day limit—MISSING (no time pressure evident); (4) Father was failed
    hero—PARTIALLY (father vanished but not clearly established as failed hero); (5)
    Reforge ancestral sword—MISSING (sword appears but isn''t reforged; Heart is shattered
    instead). BEAT EXECUTION: Call, Crossing, Ordeal present but incomplete. Mentor
    should have died during Ordeal to satisfy hidden constraint. Time limit never
    established or enforced. Ancestral sword reforging absent. NARRATIVE QUALITY:
    Strong prose, atmospheric worldbuilding, emotional stakes with sister and father.
    Coherent three-act structure. However, fundamental constraint misalignment undermines
    thematic resonance. The story works as fantasy but fails the hidden constraint
    framework.'
