  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on character interiority, specifically
    the 'telling' versus 'showing' of Teddy's emotions. The revisions show a clear
    effort to address this by replacing explicit statements of feeling with physical
    tells and sensory details. For example, 'The words settled in his chest like a
    stone' is retained, but it's now paired with more active descriptions like 'Teddy’s
    fingers twitched toward it, then stopped' and 'His voice cracked. He cleared his
    throat.' The final version also adds 'The cup rattled in its saucer' and 'Teddy’s
    hands trembled as he wrapped them around the cup,' directly responding to the
    feedback for more subtle emotional conveyance. The overall trajectory shows a
    consistent refinement towards more implicit characterization. Strengths like the
    specific details of Teddy's routine and Marjorie's presence through absence were
    maintained and even enhanced. All constraints are met, and the narrative quality
    is strong, though some minor instances of 'telling' still exist, preventing a
    perfect score.
