  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-2 show minimal substantive changes (primarily
    word choice refinement: ''warm blanket'' → ''heavy blanket'', ''essence of her
    latest t...'' remains incomplete). Version 3 introduces meaningful sensory expansion
    (''sizzling sausages and sweet pretzels'') and contextual depth (''gentrifying
    neighborhood''). Final output builds on V3 with stronger narrative architecture
    and thematic coherence. Quality improvement is moderate but consistent.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Non-visual sensory details PROMINENT - STRONG: Humidity,
    fabric texture, street vendor sounds, sizzling, construction clatter, heartbeat,
    sirens, whispers. (2) Blindness as strength ADEQUATE: Imani''s audio memory and
    listening abilities are positioned as assets, but the portrayal could be more
    nuanced—her blindness feels somewhat backgrounded in execution despite narrative
    intent. (3) Specific audio clue SATISFIED: The ''faint rustling, almost like whispers''
    serves as the crucial clue that Imani recognizes while others dismiss. (4) Character
    underestimation SATISFIED: Marcus explicitly underestimates her, assuming blindness
    limits insight; guests dismiss her audio detection as ''overactive imagination.''
    (5) Fun and Games entertainment WEAK: The gathering scene has potential but lacks
    genuine entertainment payoff. The ''lively debates and laughter'' are told rather
    than shown; the artist''s anecdote about painting feels generic. The tonal shift
    to darkness happens abruptly rather than emerging organically from entertainment.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Opening Image (0.85) - vivid sensory immersion, strong. Catalyst
    (0.8) - Marcus visit creates tension and establishes underestimation. Fun and
    Games (0.6) - Conceptually present but underdeveloped; lacks specific entertaining
    moments that would make the subsequent darkness more impactful. Bad Guys Close
    In (0.75) - Effective escalation with environmental sound changes and threatening
    message, though resolution feels rushed.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY GAPS: (1) The ''Fun and Games'' section needs specific, entertaining
    scenes with genuine humor/joy before the turn—currently it''s summarized rather
    than dramatized. (2) Imani''s blindness, while respected, could be more actively
    integrated as investigative advantage rather than background detail. (3) The audio
    clue (whispers) is identified but its significance and how it connects to the
    mystery remains underdeveloped. (4) Pacing accelerates too quickly in final section;
    tension building could be more gradual.'
