  evidence: "The plan covers most constraints and beats, though some details are vague\
    \ (e.g., 'Korean cultural element beyond food'). The output generally follows\
    \ the plan, but the 'Confrontation' beat is less distinct than planned, blending\
    \ into the resolution. \n\nConstraint Satisfaction:\n- Food used symbolically\
    \ twice: Yes (Kimchi Jjigae to mend rift, cooking class as new beginning).\n-\
    \ David's grief present but not explicit: Yes, handled well through his attachment\
    \ to the restaurant and Mia's comments.\n- Daughter's estrangement cause: Yes,\
    \ 'her feeling that he has not moved on from her mother's death' is specific and\
    \ believable.\n- Regular customer representing something: Yes, Mr. Kim is a 'father\
    \ figure' and represents community/tradition.\n- Ending hopeful but not unrealistically\
    \ happy: Yes, new beginning with community center, but restaurant is still gone.\n\
    - Korean cultural element beyond food: This is the weakest point. The only explicit\
    \ Korean element is the food itself (Kimchi Jjigae, Seoul Garden name). The plan\
    \ mentioned 'reflects on his late wife’s spirit in the restaurant' which could\
    \ have been a cultural element if expanded, but it wasn't. The output doesn't\
    \ introduce any other distinct cultural element.\n\nBeat Execution:\n- Setup (Act\
    \ 1): Well executed, introducing David, the restaurant, the threat, and Mia's\
    \ tension.\n- Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint): Present, but less of a distinct\
    \ 'midpoint' confrontation as planned. The argument with Mia serves this purpose,\
    \ but it feels a bit less impactful than a planned 'decision point' and 'community\
    \ rally' leading to a direct confrontation.\n- Resolution (Act 3): Clearly executed\
    \ with the final day, the conversation with Mia, and the hopeful new beginning.\n\
    \nNarrative Quality: The story flows well, the characters are relatable, and the\
    \ emotional arc is clear. Pacing is good, and the tension builds appropriately.\
    \ The dialogue is natural. The ending feels earned."
