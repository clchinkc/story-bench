  evidence: 'Across critique rounds reviewers flagged methodical action, an early
    hint to Sarah''s past, a local''s secret, and the fog''s narrative role. The final
    draft incorporates these: Sarah''s procedure is shown through actions (examining
    the body, cataloging evidence, laying out files), the past case is hinted early
    (“haunting memories...”) before the tattoo reveal, Officer Greeley is given guarded
    lines implying a secret, and the fog is used functionally to obscure witnesses/evidence
    and impede her investigation. The ending was adjusted to a decision moment (hand
    hovering over files/phone). Improvements are clear and consistent, though some
    lines still lean toward telling (e.g., explicit statements that the fog “was more
    than just atmosphere”), which prevents the piece from being exceptional.'
