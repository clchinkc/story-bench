  evidence: The initial critiques focused heavily on constraint satisfaction, particularly
    Sarah's methodical nature and the fog's narrative purpose. The revisions, especially
    from V0 to V2/V3, show a clear effort to integrate these elements more explicitly
    and earlier in the text. For instance, the addition of 'The fog was thickening...
    She worked faster—clock, catalog, document—before the scene changed...' directly
    addresses the fog's narrative role and Sarah's methodical response to it. The
    final output successfully weaves in all constraints, demonstrating a strong response
    to the feedback. The core strengths of the initial draft (Sarah's character, the
    intriguing setup) were preserved and enhanced.
