  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer systematically addressed the emotional
    complexity feedback across revisions. Critique 1 noted the opening joke lacked
    comedic punch; Critique 3 praised the same joke as effective (''why can''t you
    kids just google each other?''), indicating the writer refined the setup/punchline
    mechanics. The half-second vulnerability moment (''For one half-second, Marcus
    felt it...Then it passed'') appears in all versions, showing the writer preserved
    this core strength while deepening surrounding context. Version 3 adds the whiteboard
    detail (''Laugh counts were marked in red: 4.2 per page'') which directly addresses
    the industry authenticity critique by showing the mechanization of emotion—a meta-commentary
    that elevates the piece.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Clear progression from V0→V3. Early versions establish
    the premise; V3 adds structural sophistication through the opening whiteboard
    description that frames the entire conflict (emotion reduced to equations). The
    Priya introduction becomes sharper—moving from generic ''fresh writer'' to someone
    who diagnoses structural problems with surgical precision. The final version''s
    dialogue (''You''ve got a structural problem in act two'') demonstrates the writer
    learned to show expertise through action rather than exposition. The ending''s
    restraint (''He wrote, in small letters beneath the structure: "Act Two. What
    if she tells the truth instead?"'') is more powerful than earlier versions likely
    were.


    PRESERVATION: All three critiques praised the emotional complexity and the half-second
    vulnerability beat. These remain intact and strengthened. The Danny backstory,
    the apartment imagery, the deflection-as-reflex characterization—all preserved.
    The writer didn''t overcorrect by adding melodrama; instead, she deepened the
    existing architecture. The ''teeth'' smile detail and the yogurt-eating imagery
    remain, showing restraint.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. ✓ Marcus makes us laugh before sadness is clear: ''why can''t you kids just
    google each other?'' / ''Google IS the grandma'' lands as genuine comedy before
    the emotional deadness is revealed.

    2. ✓ Theme stated by minor character: Priya articulates it (''Because I''m tired
    of writing what''s been written...I thought maybe if I wrote it right, it could
    mean something''). This IS the theme—that comedy/art can matter.

    3. ✓ Craft of comedy writing with specific detail: The whiteboard mechanics, laugh
    counts, act-break structure, callback analysis, the structural problem diagnosis—all
    demonstrate deep comedy writing knowledge.

    4. ✓ New writer sees through Marcus: Priya immediately identifies the structural
    flaw, recognizes his deflection (''That''s very sweet''), and delivers the cutting
    line (''Heard you used to be funny. Before you were good.'')—she''s not naive.

    5. ✓ Marcus almost breaks but covers with joke: The moment after Priya''s vulnerability
    confession—''He almost laughed. It would have been easier if she had''—followed
    by his cruel deflection (''That''s very sweet...They sand everyone down eventually'').
    The crack comes when she says ''Heard you used to be funny,'' and he responds
    by rewriting the script rather than with a joke, showing the break through action.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Save the Cat structure present but subverted (appropriate for
    meta-commentary). Inciting incident: Priya arrives and challenges the status quo.
    Rising action: The structural diagnosis and vulnerability exchange. Midpoint:
    Marcus''s near-break and the cruel deflection. Climax: Priya''s cutting observation
    about being funny ''before you were good.'' Resolution: Marcus rewrites, choosing
    truth over formula. The beats serve character development rather than plot mechanics—sophisticated
    execution.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: The prose balances specificity with emotional resonance. ''Laugh
    counts were marked in red: 4.2 per page. Target: 4.5. Emotional beats were reduced
    to equations'' is industry-authentic and thematically dense. The dialogue feels
    natural (Derek''s phone-checking, the room''s reaction to Priya''s challenge).
    The ending resists easy redemption—Marcus doesn''t suddenly become good; he just
    writes one line differently. This restraint is more credible than a full transformation.
    The voice is consistent, the pacing controlled, the emotional stakes clear without
    being overwrought.'
