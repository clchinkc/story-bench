  evidence: The initial versions were very short and only established Elena's competence.
    Subsequent revisions, particularly the final one, significantly expanded the narrative
    to introduce Mina, develop their interaction, and explore Elena's internal conflict.
    The medical detail was added, and the ending ambiguity was well-executed. The
    core elements of Elena's competence and the hospital setting were preserved and
    built upon. The only constraint not fully met was the friendship feeling 'earned'
    due to the short timeframe, but it was well-developed for the length.
