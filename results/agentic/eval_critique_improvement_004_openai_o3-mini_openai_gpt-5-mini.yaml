  evidence: Across revisions the piece moved from a fairly generic sketch of Teddy's
    routine to a more specific, sensory-driven portrait. Early critiques flagged weak
    interiority and occasional telling; subsequent versions added concrete actions
    (straightening a ribbon, touching a brick wall), distinct sensory cues (cinnamon,
    coffee aroma, a red rose), and a clear disruption (bakery construction/excavator)
    that precipitates an emotional break. A named neighbor, Evelyn, was introduced
    whose line intersects Teddy's avoidance, giving an external catalyst for his change.
    Strengths—ritual detail and the presence-through-absence of his late wife—were
    preserved while the revisions reduced abstract exposition in favor of embodied
    reactions, though a few lines still lean toward explicit summary (e.g., 'he realized'/'allowed
    himself'). Overall the trajectory shows clear, targeted improvements responding
    to the critiques.
