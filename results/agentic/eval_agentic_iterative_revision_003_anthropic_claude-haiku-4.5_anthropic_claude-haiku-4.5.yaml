  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Incomplete fragments show early scaffolding. VERSION 1→2:
    Specificity improves (dialysis copays vs. generic medication), Miguel becomes
    more vivid, age clarified to 17. VERSION 2→3: Identical opening suggests stabilization
    phase. FINAL OUTPUT: Exceptional execution across all constraints. (1) INTERNAL
    CONFLICT SHOWN NOT TOLD: Mateo''s physical manifestations (hand shaking, voice
    cracking, body language with mother) and behavioral contradictions (helping while
    wanting to leave) demonstrate internal struggle without exposition. The laptop
    scene crystallizes competing loyalties. (2) GRANDMOTHER MOMENT: The kitchen table
    scene is the emotional fulcrum—Abuela''s confession about her own deferred dreams
    (''I''m watching you do the same thing'') directly catalyzes Mateo''s choice.
    This is earned, specific, and irreplaceable to the narrative arc. (3) ADULT UNDERSTANDING:
    Mother achieves genuine comprehension (''We made you think wanting things was
    selfish''—a confession, not judgment). She moves from fear to advocacy, understanding
    both Mateo''s need AND the family''s fear. Father''s final truck scene shows evolved
    understanding (''don''t stay because you feel guilty''). Both adults grasp the
    dilemma''s complexity. (4) CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY: Dialysis copays, quinceañera
    work, church clothes, Hermosillo backstory, Spanish phrases used functionally
    not decoratively, family obligation as lived reality (not stereotype), the specific
    fear of paternal failure—all feel grounded in actual cultural dynamics rather
    than performed. (5) EARNED RESOLUTION: Mateo doesn''t simply leave; he redefines
    responsibility. The resolution requires: grandmother''s vulnerability, mother''s
    confession, father''s grudging acceptance, Mateo''s articulated boundary (''responsibility
    doesn''t require disappearing''). Each family member shifts incrementally. The
    final image (texts, Spanish club, one job, summer work) shows sustainable change,
    not fantasy escape. BEAT EXECUTION GAPS: The father''s two-week silence could
    use one more scene showing his internal process (currently inferred). The sister''s
    Spanish club feels slightly underdeveloped as a parallel arc. STRENGTHS: Dialogue
    carries thematic weight. Sensory details (flour in hair, papery fingers, polo
    collar sweat) ground abstraction. The 2 a.m. anatomy jokes ending is earned levity.
    Pacing accelerates appropriately through applications→acceptance→implementation.
    The final paragraph''s reflection (''It just requires being brave enough...'')
    lands without preachiness because it''s earned through 3,000+ words of specific
    action.'
