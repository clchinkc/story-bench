  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is exceptionally detailed with character arcs, dialogue
    moments, and pacing notes. Output executes most constraints effectively: (1) False
    lead—community kitchen stakeout is convincing misdirection; (2) Unconventional
    profiling—sentiment analysis algorithm + rainfall meteorology model is creative
    and specific; (3) Ticking clock—31 hours to next storm, 3 storms total deadline;
    (4) Betrayal—Elena''s email cutoff is sharp and earned; (5) Midpoint confrontation—phone
    call with killer is verbal/psychological, not physical. All four beats present:
    Catalyst (killer''s call), Debate (Elena confrontation about methods), Break into
    Two (decision to stake out kitchen), Midpoint (killer''s second call revealing
    misdirection). WEAKNESSES: (1) Past failure confrontation is implicit rather than
    explicit—Marcus reflects on warehouse/Sam but doesn''t have a direct scene where
    he verbally confronts his own culpability to another character or himself with
    full clarity. The guilt is present but the confrontation feels more internal/acknowledged
    than dramatically staged. (2) Plan mentions ''memory, confession, and final verbal
    confrontation'' for past failure but output only delivers internal reflection
    and one phone exchange. (3) Narrative ends on setup rather than resolution—leaves
    reader in medias res without showing how Marcus will execute his plan. EXECUTION
    QUALITY: Dialogue is sharp, pacing is tight, rain imagery is consistent and thematic.
    Character motivations are clear. The false lead is sophisticated—it''s not obviously
    wrong until the killer reveals it. Tension escalates appropriately. The betrayal
    lands emotionally because Elena''s position is sympathetic and justified.'
