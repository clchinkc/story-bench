  evidence: 'The three critiques all scored constraint satisfaction at 0.9-1.0, indicating
    the initial version already met requirements strongly. Across versions 0-3, the
    text appears nearly identical in the provided excerpts, suggesting minimal revision
    occurred despite critique feedback. However, the final output demonstrates exceptional
    execution: (1) Methodical nature established through precise action (pen alignment,
    boot placement, grid methodology, counting wiper sweeps) rather than exposition—CONSTRAINT
    1 satisfied at 1.0. (2) Fog serves dual narrative purposes: sensory deprivation
    device that obscures evidence AND active antagonist erasing the crime scene, plus
    thematic mirror to Sarah''s emotional fog—CONSTRAINT 2 satisfied at 1.0. (3) Deputy
    Miller harbors a secret (recognizes victim, lies about it)—CONSTRAINT 3 satisfied
    at 1.0. (4) Boston warehouse case hinted at progressively (phantom itch, Dorchester
    reference, rookie officer death, ''Sculptor'' reveal) before full revelation—CONSTRAINT
    4 satisfied at 1.0. (5) Ends on decision moment (''Cancel the State Police call.
    This is my scene'') rather than resolution—CONSTRAINT 5 satisfied at 1.0. Beat
    execution strong: discovery beat (floater found), investigation beat (methodical
    processing), revelation beat (spiral recognition triggering past trauma). Prose
    quality exceptional with precise sensory detail, psychological depth, and tension
    escalation. Weakness: revision trajectory unclear—versions appear identical, suggesting
    either minimal changes made or incomplete documentation of iterative improvements.
    Critique responsiveness appears limited since no visible modifications address
    specific feedback points, though final output may represent cumulative refinement
    not visible in truncated excerpts.'
