  evidence: 'Version 0 establishes Elena''s competence and a sterile setting but is
    incomplete. Version 1 introduces her flaw (solitude) and personal life hints.
    Version 2 deepens the isolation and sets up an inciting need. Version 3 and the
    final draft add a concrete catalyst (Miguel out), introduce Sam, stage a medical
    crisis (asthma: falling O2 saturation, nebulizer, high-flow O2, prepare to intubate,
    albuterol) that earns Sam''s bond with Elena, and end on an ambiguous beat (door
    left ajar). Quality steadily rises: stakes and emotional payoff are added, medical
    specificity and dramatic action are integrated, and the ending preserves uncertainty.
    Minor note: the friendship is believable and earned within a short scene but could
    be expanded for even greater emotional weight.'
