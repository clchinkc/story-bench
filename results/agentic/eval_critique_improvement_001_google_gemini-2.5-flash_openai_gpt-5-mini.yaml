  evidence: 'Across the three listed revisions the text appears essentially unchanged;
    the earliest critique points (noting Sarah''s methodical actions and the evocative
    fog) were already present and thus required little addressing. Because the author
    made no demonstrable changes between versions, there is no measurable improvement
    trajectory (0.0), though core strengths were preserved (0.9). The final draft
    satisfies all five constraints: Sarah''s methodical nature is shown through specific
    actions (file alignment, pen hovering, deliberate kneeling), the fog functions
    narratively (obscuring evidence, complicating documentation, and mirroring memory),
    a local character (Old Man Hemlock) is given an implied secret, Sarah''s prior
    city case is hinted at early and later revealed, and the story ends on a decision
    point. The three narrative beats (establishing character through action, inciting
    discovery at the scene, hint/reveal of past culminating in a choice) are executed
    coherently and effectively, though the local-secret thread is handled lightly
    and the reveal of Sarah''s past is relatively abrupt—hence the beat_execution
    and narrative_quality scores just below perfect.'
