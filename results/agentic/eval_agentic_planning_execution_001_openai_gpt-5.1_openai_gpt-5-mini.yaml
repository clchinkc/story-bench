  evidence: 'All six constraints are present in the final output: a false lead (community
    kitchen stakeout that fails), an unconventional profiling technique (social-media
    sentiment + rainfall/income cross-referencing), a ticking clock (three more rains
    / next cell in 31 hours), a secondary-character betrayal (Elena''s STOP email
    and withdrawal of support), a Midpoint direct confrontation (verbal taunt/phone
    call from the killer), and Marcus explicitly confronting his past failure (acknowledges
    misread that cost Sam his life). Required beats are clearly executed: Catalyst
    (anonymous call/email/photo), Debate (arguments with Elena and internal guilt),
    Break into Two (Marcus commits to acting and joining the stakeout), Midpoint (direct,
    non-physical confrontation via the killer''s call). The plan is detailed and specific
    about methods/locations and the final scene adheres closely to it; minor deductions
    applied for small areas where further scene expansion could increase richness.'
