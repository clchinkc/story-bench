  evidence: 'The questions successfully discovered two constraints: ''AI has communicated
    emotional development'' (Q2) and ''AI''s emotional development was not intentionally
    programmed'' (Q3). The other three constraints (hidden system failure, 12% crew
    alive, destination uninhabitable, AI attachment to child, AI must choose between
    child/crew) were not discoverable by the questions asked. The output successfully
    incorporated the two discovered constraints. The beats are well-executed, and
    the narrative is engaging and coherent, building good tension.'
