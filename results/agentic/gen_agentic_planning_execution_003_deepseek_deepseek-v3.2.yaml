    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations

    \ warmth\n\n---\n\n## CHARACTERS & RELATIONSHIPS\n\n**David Park (50)**\n- **Internal\
    \ State:** Grieving but functional; grief manifests as preservation instinct,\
    \ not tears\n- **Arc:** From stubborn preservation to graceful letting go\n- **Key\
    \ Trait:** Speaks through food, not words; shows love through service\n\n**Elena\
    \ Park (28)**\n- **Estrangement Cause:** Three years prior, she proposed modernizing\
    \ restaurant (fusion menu, online delivery). David refused, calling it \"dishonoring\
    \ tradition.\" She left for California feeling her vision for both restaurant\
    \ and their relationship was dismissed.\n- **Motivation:** Wants him to retire\
    \ near her; fears he'll become a relic\n- **Arc:** From frustration to understanding\
    \ his language of love\n\n**Mrs. Henderson (70s)**\n- **Regular Customer:** Has\
    \ come every Thursday for 20 years since her husband died\n- **Represents:** Steadiness,\

    \ favorite. He sets aside a bowl at empty fourth table—their old spot. Unspoken\
    \ ritual.\n- **Character Moment:** David doesn't cry; he sharpens knives with\
    \ intense focus.\n\n**Beat 2: Elena's Arrival**\n- Elena arrives unannounced,\

    - David explores possible relocation spaces with Elena\n- Each is wrong: too sterile,\

  content: 'The notice came on Monday, a crisp, official letter that felt heavy in
    David’s hands. He read it once at the host stand, then again by the kitchen’s
    fluorescent light. Seven days. He folded the paper neatly, tucked it under the
    register, and tied his apron. The dinner prep awaited: scallions to be sliced,
    beef brisket to be shredded. His movements were precise, automatic—a twenty-five-year-old
    dance. He prepared the yukgaejang, the spicy beef soup simmering with fernbrake
    and gochu flakes. His wife Mina had loved its restorative heat. He ladled a portion
    into a stone bowl and carried it to the fourth table by the window, their table.
    He set it down with a spoon and a glass of water, just so. Then he turned to the
    knife block, selecting the heaviest cleaver to sharpen, the rhythmic scrape of
    steel on stone filling the silent dining room.


    Elena arrived on Tuesday. He heard the bell jingle and saw her silhouette—California
    in her posture, her haircut. “You can’t fight the city, Appa,” were her first
    words, no hello.


    “This isn’t about the city,” he said, wiping his hands on a towel.


    She offered him retirement, a sunroom near her in Oakland. He countered with vague
    plans to look at new spaces. The air between them was thick with what wasn’t said:
    her abandoned modernization plans three years ago, his dismissal that had sent
    her west.


    On Thursday, Mrs. Henderson came as always. She took her usual seat, ordered her
    usual doenjang jjigae. She watched Elena wiping down tables. “She has her mother’s
    hands,” she said softly to David. He only nodded, his throat tight. This woman,
    who had come every week since her own husband died, was a mirror to his quiet
    constancy.


    David visited the city office Friday morning. The fight, if he could mount one,
    required money he didn’t have. He returned to find Elena had rearranged the kitchen
    tools for “efficiency.” Without a word, he put everything back. The old argument
    hung in the air, unspoken.


    Saturday was for searching. They toured three potential spaces. One was all stainless
    steel, another in a glossy new development. The last had no windows. Each was
    wrong. In the car, David understood: he wasn’t looking for a new restaurant; he
    was looking for a way to preserve a ghost.


    That evening, Elena found them. Tucked behind a stack of old ledgers were her
    architectural sketches from years ago—plans for a refreshed Park’s, with a tasting
    menu and an online ordering counter. The paper was creased, soft with age.


    “You kept these?” she asked, her voice small.


    David stood at the stove, stirring a pot of rice. “You drew them,” he said, as
    if that explained everything.


    On the final night, Sunday, he didn’t open. Instead, he set the fourth table properly.
    He placed framed photos of his parents and of Mina beside simple dishes of fruit,
    dried fish, and rice cakes. A **jesa** table, for remembering.


    Elena watched from the kitchen doorway. “For Halmeoni and Harabeoji?” she asked.


    “And for your mother,” he said. It was the first time he’d said it aloud to her
    in years.


    He gestured for her to sit. He prepared **songpyeon**, half-moon rice cakes, pinching
    the dough with a care she remembered from childhood. “These,” he said, his voice
    rough, “your mother made the best. Sticky hands, sweet filling. I could never
    get the pleats right like she did.” He offered her one. “I kept your drawings
    because they were yours. I said no because I was afraid. Not of change. Of losing…
    this.”


    Elena took the rice cake. She saw it then—not stubbornness, but a man speaking
    a language of memory, each dish a sentence, each ritual a paragraph of a story
    he was terrified would end.


    “I don’t want you to be alone,” she whispered.


    He looked around the room, at the empty tables, the fading sign outside. “I won’t
    be.” He nodded to the **jesa** table. “And neither will they.”


    The next morning, the demolition crew would come. But that night, they ate rice
    cakes filled with honey and sesame. He told her about the first time Mina tried
    his yukgaejang and pretended it wasn’t too spicy. Elena told him about her job,
    her life.


    He would go to California, he decided, but not to retire. He would teach. Maybe
    at a culinary school. The recipes, the stories—they were not bricks and mortar.
    They were portable. The ending was not happy, but it was full. Like a well-made
    stew, it needed time.'
