  evidence: 'Early versions were essentially identical and leaned heavily on an evocative
    opening without much scene work. By Version 3 the writer added concrete scenes
    (Lena at the Miller house, repeated detour visits, the community garden, Mr. Patel’s
    loaf), which addressed earlier notes about interiority by giving Teddy more embodied
    moments (hands, breath, hesitation) and social interactions. Strengths—the lovingly
    detailed route, Martha''s persistent absence, and the opening image—were preserved.
    Weaknesses remain modest: the "need" and the "price/take" beats of the Story Circle
    are present but lightly sketched rather than dramatized, and some emotional shifts
    are signaled rather than fully earned. Overall the revisions move the piece forward
    meaningfully but stop short of fully deepening the inner stakes and the cost of
    change.'
