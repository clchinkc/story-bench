  evidence: Across revisions the piece moved from a skeletal room beat (v0) to a richer,
    scene-specific snapshot (v2/v3) and then to a focused, emotionally layered final.
    Early drafts contained the sentient-cake gag and a flat room description; later
    drafts added the show title, Chloe’s clear-eyed presence, and the explicit Theme
    Stated line by Ben—directly answering the constraint that theme come from a minor
    character. The final draft also inserted a concrete craft moment (Marcus lecturing
    on Rule of Three and diagramming setups/punchlines) and a distinct almost-break
    at the coffee machine that he masks with a joke, addressing critiques about emotional
    complexity and showing craft. Strengths (the central joke, the tonal contrast
    of laugh-then-hollow) were preserved and amplified; remaining limitations are
    mainly in compressed Save-the-Cat coverage—beats are present (Theme Stated, Catalyst,
    Debate/Return to Form) but not exhaustively mapped out, so beat execution is solid
    but not exhaustive.
