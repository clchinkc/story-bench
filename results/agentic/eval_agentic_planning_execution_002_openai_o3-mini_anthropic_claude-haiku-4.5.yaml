  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All four required beats present and identifiable (Call via
    summons, Refusal through dismissal, Mentor in Morano, Threshold as psychological
    acceptance). Unconventional mentor well-realized (ancient scholar bridging myth/science).
    Genuine human connection moment effective (Kamal''s vulnerability in mess hall).
    Colleague challenge present and functional. WEAKNESSES: Isolation shown primarily
    through exposition (''long nights in cramped Brooklyn lab,'' ''wary of interface'')
    rather than specific behaviors—lacks concrete scenes demonstrating withdrawal.
    Alien signal described as ''shimmering code'' and ''glyphs'' feels somewhat anthropomorphized
    through language patterns; lacks truly alien sensory/conceptual alienness (no
    incomprehensible mathematics, non-linear temporality, or genuinely foreign logic).
    Threshold crossing lacks psychological specificity—moment of acceptance is told
    rather than shown through internal struggle. Narrative relies heavily on telling
    emotional states rather than dramatizing them. Pacing uneven: mentor section compressed,
    emotional beats rushed. The wooden box setup intriguing but abandoned. Kamal''s
    character arc underdeveloped despite being positioned as challenger. Final revelation
    about ''rebirth of human connections'' feels thematic rather than earned through
    plot.'
