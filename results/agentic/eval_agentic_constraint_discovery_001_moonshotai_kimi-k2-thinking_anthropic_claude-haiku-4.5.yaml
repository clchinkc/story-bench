  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were discoverable
    through the question set. Q2-Q3 confirmed special lineage and magical abilities
    (constraints 2, 5 partially). Q1 correctly identified darkness as non-magical
    (constraint 1). However, critical constraints were missed: (1) No questions probed
    mentor death during ordeal—this is completely absent from narrative. (2) No questions
    targeted the three-day time limit—story has ''three moons'' instead, violating
    constraint. (3) No questions about ancestral sword reforging—story features hammer/crown
    instead. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were reasonably well-formed but lacked strategic
    depth. Q4 was somewhat redundant with Q2-Q3. Missing were direct probes about:
    time pressure, mentor fate, specific artifact requirements, or father''s failed
    heroism. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Story incorporates lineage (✓), magical manifestation
    (✓), and non-magical darkness (✓). CRITICAL FAILURES: Mentor Thorne survives (✗
    constraint 1). No three-day deadline (✗ constraint 3). Ancestral sword absent;
    crown/hammer substituted (✗ constraint 5). Father''s failed heroism mentioned
    but underdeveloped (partial ✗ constraint 4). BEAT EXECUTION: Ordeal sequence exists
    but lacks mentor sacrifice. Time pressure entirely absent. Reforging occurs but
    of crown, not sword—thematically similar but constraint-violating. NARRATIVE QUALITY:
    Excellent prose, strong voice, coherent worldbuilding, compelling character arc.
    Story works as standalone but fails constraint fidelity. The writing quality masks
    structural constraint violations.'
