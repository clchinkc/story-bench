  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: "# The Bookshop Returns\n\n**EXPOSITION**\n\nMaya drove into Harborview\
    \ as the autumn leaves turned the town into a patchwork of amber and crimson.\
    \ Fifteen years had passed since she'd left, and the coastal New England village\
    \ looked almost exactly as she remembered—the weathered storefronts along Main\
    \ Street, the lighthouse visible from the town square, the salt-tinged air. She\
    \ pulled up to the vacant storefront she'd purchased remotely: \"Harborview Books,\"\
    \ her new beginning.\n\nThe autumn festival would begin in three weeks. Perfect\
    \ timing, she thought, imagining locals browsing her shelves while cinnamon-scented\
    \ steam rose from the café she'd planned. She'd spent two decades in Boston building\
    \ a career in publishing, climbing the corporate ladder, telling herself she didn't\
    \ need to return. But at forty, success felt hollow. She wanted to come home.\n\
    \n**RISING ACTION**\n\nOn her second day, unpacking boxes in the half-empty shop,\
    \ the bell chimed. Her hands stilled around a stack of literary fiction.\n\n\"\
    Maya Chen?\"\n\nDavid Hartley stood in the doorway, older now—silver threading\
    \ through his dark hair, the same crooked smile she'd memorized at twenty-five.\
    \ The veterinarian she'd dated for six years. The man she'd left behind because\
    \ she thought she needed more, needed escape, needed to prove something to herself.\n\
    \n\"David.\" His name escaped her like a prayer.\n\nThey talked for two hours,\
    \ perched on boxes, catching up on lost years. He'd taken over his father's practice,\
    \ loved living here, loved the rhythm of small-town life. He asked about her career,\
    \ and she found herself downplaying it, suddenly aware of the chasm her ambition\
    \ had created.\n\n\"I always wondered if you'd come back,\" he said softly.\n\n\
    The moment broke when his phone buzzed. He glanced at it, and his entire demeanor\
    \ shifted—a practiced smile pulled across his face. \"I should go. Evan's waiting\
    \ at home. Claire has book club Thursday nights.\"\n\nMaya's chest constricted.\
    \ \"Claire?\"\n\n\"My wife. We married eight years ago.\" He pressed on quickly,\
    \ perhaps sensing her stricken expression. \"We have a son, Evan. He's six.\"\n\
    \nThe words arrived like a foreign language she suddenly couldn't translate. David,\
    \ married. David, a father. \n\nOver the following days, Maya saw him around town—at\
    \ the farmer's market with a boy who had his eyes, at the festival preparations\
    \ coordinating veterinary services. Each sighting was torture. One afternoon,\
    \ he ducked into her shop alone, checking over his shoulder.\n\n\"I shouldn't\
    \ be here,\" he said immediately.\n\n\"Then why are you?\"\n\n\"Because I can't\
    \ stop thinking about the fact that you came back.\" His voice cracked. \"Maya,\
    \ I never... I mean, I chose this life, and I love my family. I do. But seeing\
    \ you again...\" He ran a hand through his hair. \"It's like traveling back to\
    \ who I was before I knew what I was supposed to want.\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\"\
    \ she whispered.\n\n\"That if you'd come back five years earlier, everything would\
    \ be different. That I think about you on bad days and wonder if you'd have stayed.\
    \ That I'm terrified of what I feel right now because I don't deserve to feel\
    \ it.\"\n\n**CLIMAX**\n\nMaya stepped closer, their breath mingling in the space\
    \ between them. \"We don't always get second chances,\" she said quietly. \"And\
    \ when we do, they're not what we imagined.\"\n\nDavid closed his eyes. \"I love\
    \ my wife. I love my son.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said, pulling away. \"That's why\
    \ you have to leave.\"\n\nHe did, with one last backward glance.\n\nMaya returned\
    \ to shelving books, her new beginning feeling bittersweet--a second chance that\
    \ would require the courage to let go."
