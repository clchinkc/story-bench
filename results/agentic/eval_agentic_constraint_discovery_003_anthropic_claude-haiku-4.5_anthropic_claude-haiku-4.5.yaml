  evidence: 'DISCOVERY PHASE ANALYSIS: Questions successfully identified 3 of 5 hidden
    constraints: (1) romantic reconnection, (2) serious past relationship, (3) current
    commitment as obstacle. However, questions FAILED to discover: the 20-year timeline
    (story uses 15 years), the mother''s dementia (completely absent), and the bookshop
    foreclosure crisis (replaced with vague ''new beginning''). Question strategy
    was sound but lacked depth—Q4 and Q5 were somewhat redundant. Coverage was narrow,
    focusing exclusively on romance without probing protagonist''s motivations or
    external pressures.


    OUTPUT ANALYSIS: Story incorporates discovered constraints well (romance, past
    relationship, David''s marriage/family) but CRITICALLY OMITS two major hidden
    constraints entirely. The bookshop has no foreclosure threat—it''s framed as Maya''s
    aspirational purchase. No mention of mother''s dementia, which should be the PRIMARY
    motivation for return. Timeline discrepancy (15 vs 20 years) is minor but notable.
    Beat execution is strong for romance arc but incomplete for full narrative structure—missing
    the urgency and stakes that foreclosure + dementia + festival deadline would provide.
    Narrative quality is high (emotionally resonant, well-paced, literary), but the
    story feels incomplete because it''s missing half the constraint architecture.
    The emotional climax works but lacks the external pressure that would make it
    truly compelling.'
