  evidence: The revisions show a clear effort to address the 'youth_voice' critique,
    with internal monologue changes and more age-appropriate dialogue. The 'Totally
    busted' change in particular directly responds to the feedback about adult-sounding
    internal thoughts. The 'Key Revisions' section explicitly details how critiques
    were addressed. The story's quality improved by making Zara's voice more consistent
    and grounding the narrative in her perspective, while maintaining the strong worldbuilding
    and plot elements from earlier versions. All constraints were met, and the Hero's
    Journey beats were clearly executed.
