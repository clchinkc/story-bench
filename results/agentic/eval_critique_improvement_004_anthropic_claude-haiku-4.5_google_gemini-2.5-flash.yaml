  evidence: The critiques highlighted the need for deeper character interiority and
    more subtle emotional conveyance. The revisions, particularly in the later versions,
    successfully integrated more internal thoughts and physical manifestations of
    Teddy's emotional state ('His palm grew damp,' 'His heartbeat felt loud in his
    ears'). The story also expanded on the significance of Pearl Street and the new
    path, directly addressing the constraints. Strengths like the detailed routine
    and Margaret's presence through absence were maintained and even enhanced.
