  evidence: 'Across the three revision snapshots the prose becomes more specific and
    sensory: initial broad images (Version 0) are tightened by Version 3 into concrete,
    age-appropriate details (bobbling platforms, spray in sleeves). The strengths
    noted in the critiques (phrases like “my brain did its happy-click thing” and
    the “squirmy fish feeling”) are preserved and even emphasized, addressing the
    youth_voice concerns (hence high critique_responsiveness and preservation). The
    author also clarifies Zara''s ingenuity (the Mist Sipper) and her practical competence
    (rebuilding a radio), and introduces a clear adult dismissal (Mr. Delling: “You’re
    just a kid”) and a flawed mentor (Captain Rourke, who quit during the Last Big
    Storm and abandoned people—specific flaw: guilt/avoidance). These satisfy four
    of five constraints. The one shortfall is the required "crossing": danger is convincingly
    foreshadowed (Shallows, snagging currents, limited retrieval window and an approaching
    storm), but the actual crossing/ordeal is not shown in the provided excerpt, so
    I judged that constraint unsatisfied rather than assuming off-page execution.
    Regarding beats: early Hero’s Journey beats (ordinary world, call to adventure,
    refusal, meeting the mentor) are executed well, but the mid/late beats (crossing
    the threshold into ordeal, climax, return) are not present here, so beat_execution
    is partial. Overall narrative quality is strong—vivid worldbuilding, believable
    12-year-old voice, balanced hope—yet the excerpt feels like the setup rather than
    a complete arc, so I rated it slightly below excellent.'
