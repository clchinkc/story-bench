    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

  content: 'The fluorescent hum of the “Punch-Up Room” at Gilded Lily Productions
    was Marcus Webb’s natural habitat. Whiteboards, scrawled with joke structures
    – setups, callbacks, rule-of-threes – gleamed under the harsh light. Empty takeout
    containers, monuments to forgotten deadlines, littered every surface. Marcus,
    a man whose face seemed permanently set to “mildly inconvenienced,” stared at
    a scene description: *INT. COFFEE SHOP – DAY. Sarah spills latte on her boss.*


    “Okay, people,” he droned, pushing wire-rimmed glasses up his nose. “Sarah’s spilled
    coffee. How do we make this *not* the tenth time she’s done exactly that this
    season?” He tapped his pen. “Maybe the boss is allergic to dairy? And it’s oat
    milk, but she *thinks* it’s dairy, so she starts swelling up for no reason?” A
    few chuckles. “Or, better yet, the boss is wearing a ‘World’s Best Boss’ t-shirt,
    and the coffee completely obscures ‘Best.’ So he’s just ‘World’s Boss.’” A genuine
    laugh rippled through the room. Marcus allowed a flicker of a smile that didn''t
    quite reach his eyes. He was good at this. Too good, maybe. The jokes came, perfect
    little mechanisms, but the joy of them had evaporated years ago, leaving only
    the mechanics. He hadn’t genuinely laughed in three years, not since his own pilot
    had tanked.


    An older writer, Leonard, a man whose career had seen more reboots than a Windows
    PC, sighed, leaning back in his chair. “You know, Marcus, the trick to comedy
    isn’t just making people laugh. It’s making them *feel* something first, then
    letting the laugh be the release. Otherwise, it’s just noise. You gotta care about
    the characters, even the ones spilling lattes.” Leonard’s gaze lingered on Marcus,
    a silent observation that pricked at something Marcus refused to acknowledge.
    He just grunted, turning back to the whiteboard.


    The door creaked open, admitting a blast of LA sunshine and a young woman clutching
    a worn leather satchel. “Hi everyone! I’m Maya Sharma. So excited to be joining
    the team!” Her voice was bright, a stark contrast to the room’s ambient cynicism.
    She had wide, intelligent eyes that didn''t just see, but *observed*.


    Marcus just nodded, already mentally cataloging her as "new blood, needs to be
    broken." He remembered being that excited. He remembered the feeling of possibility,
    before the industry had sanded down every sharp edge of his enthusiasm.


    “Welcome, Maya,” Leonard said warmly. “Grab a seat. We’re currently figuring out
    how to make spilled coffee funny without resorting to slapstick or a fat suit.”


    Maya’s eyes twinkled. “Oh, I love a good coffee spill. So much potential for existential
    dread.” She looked directly at Marcus. “Is it about the coffee, or about Sarah’s
    desperate need to be seen, even if it’s by making a mess?”


    Marcus felt a jolt. Most new hires would try to impress with a punchline. She’d
    gone straight for the character’s soul, a tactic he hadn''t used in years. He
    cleared his throat, suddenly uncomfortable. “Existential dread? For a network
    sitcom? We’re trying to get to syndication, not Sundance.” He forced a smirk.
    “Unless we can make the coffee cup a metaphor for the futility of human existence,
    then sure, let’s go there.” He winked, but inside, a tiny, forgotten nerve twitched.
    It was almost a genuine reaction, a fleeting moment of self-pity he quickly crushed
    with the familiar armor of sarcasm. He pushed his glasses up again, the gesture
    a practiced shield. "Alright, existential dread it is. But only if the coffee
    cup also has a tiny hat."'

    \ 0.75**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\"He was good at this. Too good, maybe. The jokes came,\
    \ perfect little mechanisms, but the joy of them had evaporated years ago, leaving\
    \ only the mechanics. He hadn't genuinely laughed in three years, not since his\
    \ own pilot had tanked.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\nYou effectively establish the pathos\
    \ through exposition, but the emotional journey relies heavily on *telling* rather\
    \ than *showing*. Marcus's hollowness is stated explicitly rather than made visceral.\
    \ The strongest moment—his jolt when Maya speaks—deserves deeper exploration.\
    \ Consider extending this beat: what specific *physical* response does he have?\
    \ Does his hand shake when signing on the whiteboard? Does Leonard *notice* the\
    \ crack? The humor lands well (\"World's Boss\"), but the pathos needs more embodied\
    \ reactions—quiet moments where we watch him *perform* his cynicism in real-time\
    \ rather than being narrated that he's performed it.\n\n**Suggestion:** After\
    \ Maya's observation, add a line showing Marcus's body language betraying his\
    \ mind: \"He adjusted his glasses three times in succession, a tic he thought\
    \ he'd outgrown.\"\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\n**SCORE: 0.95**\n\
    \n**EVIDENCE:**\n- **Laugh before sadness:** ✓ \"World's Boss\" joke lands before\
    \ we learn he hasn't genuinely laughed in three years\n- **Theme by minor character:**\
    \ ✓ Leonard states it: \"the trick to comedy isn't just making people laugh. It's\
    \ making them *feel* something first\"\n- **Specific craft detail:** ✓ \"setups,\
    \ callbacks, rule-of-threes\" + the dairy allergy joke structure\n- **New writer\
    \ sees through Marcus:** ✓ Maya goes straight to character motive rather than\
    \ punchline\n- **Marcus almost breaks/covers with joke:** ✓ \"He felt a jolt...\
    \ forced a smirk\" followed by \"Unless we can make the coffee cup a metaphor\
    \ for the futility of human existence\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\nNearly flawless execution.\
    \ The only minor weakness: the final joke (\"coffee cup also have a tiny hat\"\
    ) feels like it deflates the moment slightly. The metaphor line was sharper—the\
    \ tiny hat addition diffuses the vulnerability. The constraint would land harder\
    \ if Marcus's deflection was *subtler*, letting the tension hang longer before\
    \ the laugh.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Beat Execution\n**SCORE: 0.85**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\
    \n**Opening Image (properly executed):**\n\"The fluorescent hum of the 'Punch-Up\
    \ Room'... Marcus, a man whose face seemed permanently set to 'mildly inconvenienced,'\
    \ stared at a scene description.\"\n\n**Theme Stated (properly executed):**\n\
    Leonard's monologue clearly articulates the story's core theme.\n\n**Catalyst\
    \ (properly executed):**\n\"The door creaked open, admitting a blast of LA sunshine\
    \ and a young woman clutching a worn leather satchel.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\nThese\
    \ three beats are cleanly executed with strong visual language. However, the *Catalyst*\
    \ could have more dramatic weight. Maya's entrance is charming but not truly disruptive—she\
    \ integrates smoothly into the room. For a catalytic moment, consider adding a\
    \ beat where Marcus's discomfort is *immediate*—perhaps Leonard introduces her\
    \ and Marcus visibly resists engaging, setting up interpersonal stakes. The beat\
    \ works, but it's gentle rather than galvanizing.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Industry\
    \ Authenticity\n**SCORE: 0.80**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\"Empty takeout containers,\
    \ monuments to forgotten deadlines, littered every surface... 'Okay people,' he\
    \ droned... 'Maybe the boss is allergic to dairy? And it's oat milk, but she *thinks*\
    \ it's dairy, so she starts swelling up for no reason?'\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\nThe\
    \ room dynamics feel genuine—the hierarchy, the joke-generation process, the tension\
    \ between network comedies and prestige TV. The takeout detail and the specific\
    \ mechanics of joke construction (callbacks, rule-of-threes, premises being riffed)\
    \ all ring true. \n\n**Minor issue:** Leonard's wisdom feels slightly *too* articulate\
    \ for casual room banter. Real writers' room mentors tend to embed wisdom in the\
    \ work rather than speechifying. Consider having Leonard demonstrate the principle\
    \ through a rewrite rather than explaining it: \"Let me show you—what if we start\
    \ with Sarah *wanting* to impress her"

    An older writer, Leonard, a man whose career had seen more reboots than a Windows

    dairy, but *lactose intolerant*? And Sarah knows it, but she’s so flustered she
    forgets, then has to watch him slowly, miserably swell?” Leonard paused, looking
    at the whiteboard. “The laugh comes from the cringe, the human recognition. You
    gotta give ‘em something to connect to first, Marcus, even in a coffee spill.
    Otherwise, it’s just noise.” His gaze, usually amiable, held a flicker of something
    knowing as it met Marcus’s. Marcus just grunted, turning back to the whiteboard,
    a muscle in his jaw twitching.


    The door creaked open, admitting a blast of LA sunshine and a young woman clutching
    a worn leather satchel. Marcus’s shoulders subtly stiffened. He didn''t even need
    to look to know what was coming: another bright-eyed, bushy-tailed newbie. Leonard,
    however, beamed. “Ah, Maya! Perfect timing. Everyone, this is Maya Sharma, our
    newest staff writer. Maya, this is the esteemed — and frequently caffeinated —
    team.”


    Maya’s voice was bright, a stark contrast to the room’s ambient cynicism. “Hi
    everyone! So excited to be joining you.” She had wide, intelligent eyes that didn''t
    just see, but *observed*. Her gaze lingered on Marcus for a beat too long before
    she found an empty chair.


    “Welcome, Maya,” Leonard said warmly. “We’re currently figuring out how to make
    spilled coffee funny without resorting to slapstick or a fat suit.”


    Maya’s eyes twinkled. “Oh, I love a good coffee spill. So much potential for…
    character. Is it about the coffee, or about Sarah’s desperate need to be seen,
    even if it’s by making a mess? Maybe she *wants* to spill it, subconsciously,
    to disrupt the status quo?” She looked directly at Marcus, her expression unblinking.


    Marcus felt a jolt, a cold splash in his gut. Most new hires would try to impress
    with a punchline. She’d gone straight for the character’s soul, a tactic he hadn''t
    used in years. He cleared his throat, suddenly uncomfortable. He adjusted his
    glasses, then adjusted them again, a tic he thought he’d outgrown. “Existential
    dread? For a network sitcom? We’re trying to get to syndication, not Sundance.”
    He forced a smirk, the corners of his mouth barely lifting. “Unless we can make
    the coffee cup a metaphor for the futility of human existence, then sure, let’s
    go there.” He winked, the gesture feeling forced even to himself, a flimsy shield
    against the unexpected tremor Maya’s insight had sent through him.'

  content: "Your previous version:\nThe fluorescent hum of the “Punch-Up Room” at\
    \ Gilded Lily Productions was Marcus Webb’s natural habitat. Whiteboards, scrawled\
    \ with joke structures – setups, callbacks, rule-of-threes – gleamed under the\
    \ harsh light. Empty takeout containers, monuments to forgotten deadlines, littered\
    \ every surface. Marcus, a man whose face seemed permanently set to “mildly inconvenienced,”\
    \ stared at a scene description: *INT. COFFEE SHOP – DAY. Sarah spills latte on\
    \ her boss.*\n\n“Okay, people,” he droned, pushing wire-rimmed glasses up his\
    \ nose. “Sarah’s spilled coffee. How do we make this *not* the tenth time she’s\
    \ done exactly that this season?” He tapped his pen. “Maybe the boss is allergic\
    \ to dairy? And it’s oat milk, but she *thinks* it’s dairy, so she starts swelling\
    \ up for no reason?” A few chuckles. “Or, better yet, the boss is wearing a ‘World’s\
    \ Best Boss’ t-shirt, and the coffee completely obscures ‘Best.’ So he’s just\
    \ ‘World’s Boss.’” A genuine laugh rippled through the room. Marcus allowed a\
    \ flicker of a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. He was good at this. Too\
    \ good, maybe. The jokes came, perfect little mechanisms, but the joy of them\
    \ had evaporated years ago, leaving only the mechanics. He hadn’t genuinely laughed\
    \ in three years, not since his own pilot had tanked.\n\nAn older writer, Leonard,\
    \ a man whose career had seen more reboots than a Windows PC, sighed, leaning\
    \ back in his chair. “What if the boss isn’t just allergic to dairy, but *lactose\
    \ intolerant*? And Sarah knows it, but she’s so flustered she forgets, then has\
    \ to watch him slowly, miserably swell?” Leonard paused, looking at the whiteboard.\
    \ “The laugh comes from the cringe, the human recognition. You gotta give ‘em\
    \ something to connect to first, Marcus, even in a coffee spill. Otherwise, it’s\
    \ just noise.” His gaze, usually amiable, held a flicker of something knowing\
    \ as it met Marcus’s. Marcus just grunted, turning back to the whiteboard, a muscle\
    \ in his jaw twitching.\n\nThe door creaked open, admitting a blast of LA sunshine\
    \ and a young woman clutching a worn leather satchel. Marcus’s shoulders subtly\
    \ stiffened. He didn't even need to look to know what was coming: another bright-eyed,\
    \ bushy-tailed newbie. Leonard, however, beamed. “Ah, Maya! Perfect timing. Everyone,\
    \ this is Maya Sharma, our newest staff writer. Maya, this is the esteemed — and\
    \ frequently caffeinated — team.”\n\nMaya’s voice was bright, a stark contrast\
    \ to the room’s ambient cynicism. “Hi everyone! So excited to be joining you.”\
    \ She had wide, intelligent eyes that didn't just see, but *observed*. Her gaze\
    \ lingered on Marcus for a beat too long before she found an empty chair.\n\n\
    “Welcome, Maya,” Leonard said warmly. “We’re currently figuring out how to make\
    \ spilled coffee funny without resorting to slapstick or a fat suit.”\n\nMaya’s\
    \ eyes twinkled. “Oh, I love a good coffee spill. So much potential for… character.\
    \ Is it about the coffee, or about Sarah’s desperate need to be seen, even if\
    \ it’s by making a mess? Maybe she *wants* to spill it, subconsciously, to disrupt\
    \ the status quo?” She looked directly at Marcus, her expression unblinking.\n\
    \nMarcus felt a jolt, a cold splash in his gut. Most new hires would try to impress\
    \ with a punchline. She’d gone straight for the character’s soul, a tactic he\
    \ hadn't used in years. He cleared his throat, suddenly uncomfortable. He adjusted\
    \ his glasses, then adjusted them again, a tic he thought he’d outgrown. “Existential\
    \ dread? For a network sitcom? We’re trying to get to syndication, not Sundance.”\
    \ He forced a smirk, the corners of his mouth barely lifting. “Unless we can make\
    \ the coffee cup a metaphor for the futility of human existence, then sure, let’s\
    \ go there.” He winked, the gesture feeling forced even to himself, a flimsy shield\
    \ against the unexpected tremor Maya’s insight had sent through him.\n\nEDITOR'S\
    \ CRITIQUE:\nCRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\nSCORE: 0.95\nEVIDENCE: \n- Constraint\
    \ 1 satisfied: \"World's Boss\" joke generates \"A genuine laugh rippled through\
    \ the room\" before reveal that he \"hadn't genuinely laughed in three years\"\
    \n- Constraint 2 satisfied: Leonard states theme: \"The laugh comes from the cringe,\
    \ the human recognition. You gotta give 'em something to connect to first\"\n\
    - Constraint 3 satisfied: Specific craft details—\"setups, callbacks, rule-of-threes,\"\
    \ the dairy/lactose intolerance discussion, the coffee obscuring text technique\n\
    - Constraint 4 satisfied: Maya immediately rejects punchline logic for psychology:\
    \ \"Maybe she *wants* to spill it, subconsciously, to disrupt the status quo?\"\
    \n- Constraint 5 satisfied: Marcus feels \"a jolt, a cold splash in his gut,\"\
    \ then covers with forced sarcasm and an awkward wink\n\nFEEDBACK: Excellent execution.\
    \ However, ensure that in subsequent scenes, you develop the mentor relationship\
    \ angle Leonard hints at—his \"knowing\" gaze suggests deeper wisdom about what\
    \ Marcus needs, not just comedic evaluation.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Beat Execution\n\
    SCORE: 0.82\nEVIDENCE:\n- Opening Image works: Marcus described as \"naturally\
    \ habituated\" to the Punch-Up Room, establishing both mastery and emptiness in\
    \ the same breath\n- Theme Stated is clear and comes from Leonard, not Marcus\n\
    - Catalyst delivers: Maya's entrance is marked and introduces the inciting incident\n\
    \nFEEDBACK: While the beats hit their marks, they lack *tension*. The opening\
    \ image could show more *cost* of Marcus's expertise—perhaps a moment where someone\
    \ else laughs at his joke and he feels *nothing*, not just that he hasn't felt\
    \ joy. The catalyst could have more visceral impact—maybe show Marcus's immediate\
    \ defensive reaction *before* masking it, so we see the wound before the scar\
    \ tissue.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Emotional Complexity\nSCORE: 0.68\nEVIDENCE:\n\
    - Humor lands first: The \"World's Boss\" joke is genuinely clever and earns authentic\
    \ laughter\n- Pathos follows: \"the joy of them had evaporated years ago, leaving\
    \ only the mechanics\"\n- Vulnerability moment: Marcus's physical reaction to\
    \ Maya's insight—the jolt, the tic, the forced wink\n\nFEEDBACK: The balance exists\
    \ but remains somewhat *stated* rather than *felt*. The line \"He hadn't genuinely\
    \ laughed in three years\" tells us his pain; we need to *see* him experiencing\
    \ the absence. Consider: What if instead of the narrative explaining his emptiness,\
    \ we watched him watch others laugh at his joke and see him feel nothing? His\
    \ jaw tick when Maya speaks is good—amplify these physical tells. Also, the forced\
    \ wink undercuts the vulnerability; let it land without the deflection for one\
    \ beat longer before he recovers.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Industry Authenticity\n\
    SCORE: 0.79\nEVIDENCE:\n- Physical details ring true: \"fluorescent hum,\" takeout\
    \ monuments, whiteboards with specific terminology\n- Dialogue feels real: Leonard's\
    \ \"more reboots than a Windows PC\" has the weary humor of an actual industry\
    \ veteran\n- Show knowledge: The distinction between network syndication comedy\
    \ and Sundance-style material shows real understanding\n- Writers' room dynamics\

    The door creaked open, admitting a blast of LA sunshine and a young woman clutching
    a worn leather satchel. Marcus’s shoulders subtly stiffened; a familiar wave of
    irritation washed over him. Another bright-eyed, bushy-tailed newbie, probably
    fresh out of some MFA program, ready to “revolutionize” network comedy. He braced
    himself for the inevitable effervescence, the naive hope he’d long since shed.
    Leonard, however, beamed. “Ah, Maya! Perfect timing. Everyone, this is Maya Sharma,
    our newest staff writer. Maya, this is the esteemed — and frequently caffeinated
    — team.”


    Maya’s voice was bright, a stark contrast to the room’s ambient cynicism. “Hi
    everyone! So excited to be joining you.” She had wide, intelligent eyes that didn''t
    just see, but *observed*. Her gaze lingered on Marcus for a beat too long, an
    uncomfortable assessment that seemed to peel back layers, before she found an
    empty chair.


    “Welcome, Maya,” Leonard said warmly. “We’re currently figuring out how to make
    spilled coffee funny without resorting to slapstick or a fat suit.”


    Maya’s eyes twinkled. “Oh, I love a good coffee spill. So much potential for…
    character. Is it about the coffee, or about Sarah’s desperate need to be seen,
    even if it’s by making a mess? Maybe she *wants* to spill it, subconsciously,
    to disrupt the status quo?” She looked directly at Marcus, her expression unblinking,
    as if she were reading the subtext of *him*.


    Marcus felt a jolt, a cold splash in his gut. A sudden, unwelcome memory of his
    younger self, brimming with similar insights, flashed through his mind. Her question
    was exactly the kind of writing he’d once craved, the kind he’d ruthlessly suppressed
    in favor of reliable gags. It felt dangerous, a threat to the carefully constructed
    shell he’d built. He cleared his throat, suddenly uncomfortable. He adjusted his
    glasses, then adjusted them again, a tic he thought he’d outgrown. “Existential
    dread? For a network sitcom? We’re trying to get to syndication, not Sundance.”
    He forced a smirk, the corners of his mouth barely lifting. “Unless we can make
    the coffee cup a metaphor for the futility of human existence, then sure, let’s
    go there.” He kept his gaze fixed on the whiteboard, not daring to meet hers,
    the words a flimsy, desperate shield against the unexpected tremor Maya’s insight
    had sent through him. It was easier to be the cynical pro than to acknowledge
    the faint, terrifying echo of his own lost passion.'

output: 'The fluorescent hum of the “Punch-Up Room” at Gilded Lily Productions,
  a sprawling complex that housed the network’s sitcom factory, was Marcus Webb’s
  natural habitat. Whiteboards, scrawled with joke structures – setups, callbacks,
  rule-of-threes – gleamed under the harsh light. Empty Thai takeout containers and
  half-eaten protein bars, monuments to forgotten deadlines, littered every surface.
  Marcus, a man whose face seemed permanently set to “mildly inconvenienced,” stared
  at a scene description: *INT. COFFEE SHOP – DAY. Sarah spills latte on her boss.*


  “Okay, people,” he droned, pushing wire-rimmed glasses up his nose. “Sarah’s spilled
  coffee. How do we make this *not* the tenth time she’s done exactly that this season
  on ‘The Daily Grind’?” He tapped his pen. “Maybe the boss is allergic to dairy?
  And it’s oat milk, but she *thinks* it’s dairy, so she starts swelling up for no
  reason?” A few chuckles. “Or, better yet, the boss is wearing a ‘World’s Best Boss’
  t-shirt, and the coffee completely obscures ‘Best.’ So he’s just ‘World’s Boss.’”
  A genuine laugh rippled through the room. Marcus watched them, a detached observer.
  He’d crafted the joke perfectly, a well-oiled machine. But the satisfaction was
  purely technical; the joy of it had evaporated years ago, leaving only the mechanics.
  He hadn''t genuinely laughed in three years, not since his own pilot had tanked
  and the industry had taught him to value precision over passion.


  An older writer, Leonard, a man whose career had seen more reboots than a Windows
  PC, sighed, leaning back in his chair. He glanced at his phone, a quick check of
  the latest ratings report for a rival show, before returning his attention to the
  room. “What if the boss isn’t just allergic to dairy, but *lactose intolerant*?
  And Sarah knows it, but she’s so flustered she forgets, then has to watch him slowly,
  miserably swell? The laugh comes from the cringe, the human recognition, Marcus,”
  Leonard said, looking at the whiteboard but directing his words squarely at Marcus.
  “You gotta give ‘em something to connect to first, even in a coffee spill. Otherwise,
  it’s just noise.” His gaze, usually amiable, held a flicker of something knowing
  as it met Marcus’s. Marcus just grunted, turning back to the whiteboard, a muscle
  in his jaw twitching.
