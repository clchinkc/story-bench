  evidence: 'Constraints: Food is used symbolically at least twice (kimchi stew as
    memories; bibimbap/egg as unity) — satisfied. David''s grief is present but explicitly
    named (''His grief... pulsed quietly'') — fails the ''not stated explicitly''
    requirement. Daughter''s estrangement has a specific cause (mother''s illness
    and David''s immersion in the restaurant) — satisfied. Regular customer Mr. Kim
    is included and represents resilience — satisfied. Ending is hopeful but restrained
    (retirement, memoir, softened relationship) — satisfied. Korean cultural elements
    beyond food (hanji lanterns, hanbok, drums, harvest festival) — satisfied. Beats:
    Setup (demolition, sanctuary), Confrontation (daughter''s return and bibimbap
    scene/midweek confrontation), Resolution (decision to retire, final service) are
    all present. Plan evaluation: the provided plan text appears truncated and not
    fully detailed (low completeness/specificity), but the final output largely follows
    the intended beats and motifs (good adherence). Narrative quality: coherent pacing
    and emotional tension, minor issues with explicit wording around grief and some
    underdevelopment of secondary characters.'
