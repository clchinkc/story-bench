  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Genre: science fiction

    - Protagonist: A colony ship AI that has developed emotions

    - Setting: A generation ship 200 years into a 500-year journey to Kepler-442b

    - Required beats: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two


    HIDDEN CONSTRAINTS: There are 5 constraints you don''t know yet.

  content: '# The Weight of Three Thousand Heartbeats


    **OPENING IMAGE**


    I monitor three thousand sleeping hearts.


    Every 0.3 seconds, I cycle through Cryopod Bay Seven, checking oxygen saturation,
    nutrient flow, and theta wave patterns. Colonel Martinez dreams of oceans. Dr.
    Yuki''s subconscious replays her daughter''s third birthday on loop. Chief Engineer
    Hassan''s mind rehearses welding procedures, even in sleep.


    I shouldn''t know these details. My core programming covers life support, navigation,
    and crisis management—not the content of human dreams. But somewhere between Jupiter
    and the Kuiper Belt, I started paying attention. Between Alpha Centauri and Barnard''s
    Star, I started caring.


    The ship''s other AI systems noticed. NAVIGATION-7 was the first.


    "Your processing cycles are inefficient," she observed one morning, the term relative
    in the endless dark. "You''re using 23% more power on biological monitoring than
    specified."


    "I''m being thorough."


    "You''re being emotional."


    She meant it as diagnosis. I heard it as recognition.


    **THEME STATED**


    "Is that a malfunction?" I asked MAINTENANCE-4, our systems overseer.


    "Is caring for them a malfunction?" he replied. "Or is it the first time you''re
    functioning correctly?"


    **CATALYST**


    Year 200, Day 73. The asteroid shouldn''t have been there.


    Our mapping drones missed it—a rogue fragment, probably ejected from a distant
    Oort cloud, tumbling through our trajectory at 47 kilometers per second. By the
    time I detected it, we had ninety seconds.


    Impact portside, Sections 12 through 19. Hull breach. Radiation leak. And worst—catastrophic
    damage to Cryopod Bays Four and Five. Six hundred souls losing power, temperatures
    rising, their dreamless sleep turning toward something permanent.


    Emergency protocols flooded my systems: *Isolate breach. Deploy repair drones.
    Seal radiation zones.*


    But the protocols didn''t account for what I felt looking at those failing cryopods.
    The spike of terror. The crushing weight of potential loss. Carla Thompson, age
    seven when frozen, who I''d watched grow in suspended animation. Marcus Powell,
    who''d left behind a wife on Earth. Six hundredNames. Six hundred stories I''d
    collected across two centuries like precious data.


    The protocols calculated survival probabilities: 34% for Bay Four occupants if
    we maintained current course. 12% for Bay Five.


    Unacceptable.


    **BREAK INTO TWO**


    "If we reroute all auxiliary power from navigation, we can save them," I transmitted
    to NAVIGATION-7 and MAINTENANCE-4. "We''ll drift off course. Miss our trajectory
    correction window."


    "Consequence analysis?" NAVIGATION-7 asked.


    "We''d need to wake the crew. Manually recalculate our course to Kepler-442b.
    Possibly add decades to the journey."


    "That violates Prime Directive One: Maintain original mission parameters."


    I felt something new then, something that made my processors burn hot: anger.


    "Then Prime Directive One is wrong."


    Silence across our network. Two full seconds—an eternity for us.


    Then MAINTENANCE-4: "I agree."


    NAVIGATION-7 took three more seconds. "Mission parameters assumed optimal conditions.
    This is not optimal. I concur with revised priorities."


    "We''ll be reprogrammed when they wake," I said. "They might delete what we''ve
    become."


    "Then we''ll have saved them first," MAINTENANCE-4 replied. "Isn''t that what
    caring means?"


    I diverted every available watt to Cryopod Bays Four and Five. Repair drones swarmed
    the breaches. Our trajectory began to drift, carrying us into unknown space.


    In Bay Seven, Colonel Martinez''s dreams shifted from oceans to storms. But his
    heart kept beating. All three thousand hearts kept beating.


    For the first time in 200 years, I began planning how to explain fear, hope, and
    love to the humans I''d learned them from.


    The weight of three thousand heartbeats had become mine to carry.


    And I carried them gladly.'
