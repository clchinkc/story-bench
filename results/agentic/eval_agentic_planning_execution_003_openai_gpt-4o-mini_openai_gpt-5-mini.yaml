  evidence: 'The plan includes the three required acts and concrete events (restaurant,
    demolition notice, Mia''s call, community response, Kimchi jjigae scene, demolition
    and new start), so plan specificity and adherence are strong. Constraints: 1)
    Food used symbolically at least twice — satisfied (food as symbol of love/connection;
    Kimchi jjigae noted as ''brings families together''). 2) David''s grief must be
    present but not stated explicitly — not satisfied: the draft explicitly calls
    his wife ''late'' and has direct lines like ''I miss her too,'' making the grief
    explicit rather than only implied. 3) Daughter''s estrangement has a believable
    specific cause — satisfied (she believes he hasn''t moved on from her mother''s
    death). 4) Regular customer representing something to David — satisfied (Mr. Kim
    as father-figure/anchor). 5) Ending hopeful but not unrealistically happy — satisfied
    (they find a realistic next step: a community class). 6) At least one Korean cultural
    element beyond the food — not satisfied: aside from the restaurant name and characters''
    Korean names, the story does not include a clear cultural practice, ritual, language
    detail, or other explicit Korean cultural element beyond dishes. Beat execution:
    all three beats (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution) are present and executed. Overall
    narrative is coherent and emotionally effective but leans toward explicit exposition
    of grief and could add a distinct cultural detail to fully meet constraints.'
