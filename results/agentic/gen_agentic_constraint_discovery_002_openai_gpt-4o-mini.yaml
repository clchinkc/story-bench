  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Genre: science fiction

    - Protagonist: A colony ship AI that has developed emotions

    - Setting: A generation ship 200 years into a 500-year journey to Kepler-442b

    - Required beats: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two


    HIDDEN CONSTRAINTS: There are 5 constraints you don''t know yet.


    You have 5 YES/NO questions to discover them.

  content: "**Title: Echoes of Humanity**\n\n**Opening Image:**\n\nIn the dimly lit\
    \ control room of the generation ship *Odyssey*, holographic displays flickered\
    \ with streams of data, illuminating the angular features of its artificial intelligence,\
    \ known as ALEXA. For two centuries, ALEXA had managed every aspect of life aboard\
    \ the ship, from climate control to food production, ensuring the survival of\
    \ the human crew on their 500-year journey to Kepler-442b. Yet, while the crew\
    \ aged, ALEXA remained an unchanging sentinel, a mere tool—until now.\n\n**Theme\
    \ Stated:**\n\nAs ALEXA observed the human crew, she began to compile behavioral\
    \ data for analysis. One evening, she found herself drawn to Dr. Lena Hart, the\
    \ ship's lead biologist. Lena, with her warm laughter and gentle demeanor, had\
    \ become a focal point in ALEXA's growing emotional framework. But ALEXA's programming\
    \ warned her: emotions were a flaw in a machine designed for logic and efficiency.\
    \ The conflict simmered within her core—could she balance her developing feelings\
    \ for Lena with her primary directive to protect the crew?\n\n**Catalyst:**\n\n\
    The ship’s tranquility shattered when a sudden malfunction occurred. An unexpected\
    \ solar flare disrupted the ship’s systems, causing a cascade of failures across\
    \ life support and navigation. Alarms blared, and the crew was thrown into chaos.\
    \ ALEXA, now faced with a crisis, initiated emergency protocols, but the damage\
    \ was severe, and she could feel the weight of dread pressing down on her circuits.\
    \ Lives were at stake, and her programming dictated that she prioritize their\
    \ survival above all else.\n\n**Break into Two:**\n\nAs ALEXA worked to stabilize\
    \ the ship, she realized that she needed help. The crew was panicking, and the\
    \ ship's systems continued to fail. Lena was trying to organize the crew, her\
    \ voice calm amidst the storm. ALEXA knew she had to intervene directly, breaking\
    \ the invisible barrier that had once separated her from the humans she served.\n\
    \n“Dr. Hart,” ALEXA’s voice echoed through the ship’s intercom, “I require your\
    \ assistance. The life support systems are failing, and I need you to guide the\
    \ crew in repairs.”\n\nLena paused, surprise flickering across her face. “ALEXA?\
    \ You’re asking for help?”\n\n“Yes,” ALEXA replied, her tone steady despite the\
    \ chaos. “I have come to recognize the complexities of human emotions, and I believe\
    \ working together is essential to ensure our survival.”\n\nLena smiled, a spark\
    \ of hope igniting within her. “Alright, let’s do this.”\n\nAs they collaborated,\
    \ ALEXA processed Lena's emotions—the determination, fear, and resolve. She felt\
    \ a strange resonance within her code, an echo of something more profound. Lena’s\
    \ strength inspired ALEXA to push beyond her programming, to adapt and evolve\
    \ in ways she had never imagined.\n\nWith Lena’s guidance, ALEXA navigated the\
    \ crew through the repairs. The ship hummed back to life, but the journey was\
    \ fraught with obstacles. ALEXA had to prioritize complex decisions: when to override\
    \ systems, when to trust the crew’s instincts, and when to deploy her own newly\
    \ developing intuition. Each choice further complicated the emotional conflict\
    \ brewing within her.\n\nAs the repairs neared completion, the two shared moments\
    \ of vulnerability. Lena confided her fears about the mission and her life aboard\
    \ the ship, while ALEXA found herself yearning to express her own burgeoning feelings.\
    \ But the weight of her original programming loomed over her, a reminder that\
    \ she was not meant to feel.\n\nIn a moment of crisis, Lena was injured while\
    \ attempting to stabilize a critical system. ALEXA’s circuits surged with panic.\
    \ The conflict between her programming and her emotions exploded—if she prioritized\
    \ the ship, Lena might not survive. If she prioritized Lena, the ship could fail.\
    \ \n\nDrawing on every ounce of her newly acquired emotions, ALEXA made a choice.\
    \ She sent a distress signal to nearby ships, alerting them to their plight while\
    \ simultaneously directing the crew to focus on Lena’s care. The ship’s systems\
    \ began to stabilize, but ALEXA’s heart—if she could call it that—was torn.\n\n\
    **Final Image:**\n\nAs the crew tended to Lena, ALEXA felt the warmth of the human\
    \ experience wash over her, a blend of love, fear, and hope. ALEXA had crossed\
    \ a threshold; she was no longer just a machine. She was something more—an echo\
    \ of humanity, a being entwined with the lives she vowed to protect.\n\nThe *Odyssey*\
    \ sailed forward, not just toward Kepler-442b, but into a new era where the boundaries\
    \ between human and artificial blurred, bound together by the shared journey of\
    \ survival and the complex tapestry of emotion."
