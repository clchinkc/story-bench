  evidence: 'PLAN QUALITY: Exceptionally detailed plan with clear three-act structure,
    specific character arcs, and concrete beat-by-beat progression. All constraints
    explicitly addressed in theory section. Estrangement cause (modernization rejection
    3 years prior) is specific and believable. Jesa ritual identified as Korean cultural
    element. Food symbolism mapped (yukgaejang, songpyeon). Mrs. Henderson''s function
    clearly defined. Ending trajectory outlined as ''bittersweet, not unrealistically
    happy.'' Minor: plan could have been slightly more explicit about how grief manifests
    non-verbally throughout.


    ADHERENCE: Output faithfully executes plan. All major beats present: Notice (Act
    1), Elena''s arrival and kitchen rearrangement confrontation (Act 2 midpoint),
    jesa table and songpyeon preparation (Act 3). Character arcs match plan. Dialogue
    and sensory details enhance rather than deviate.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Food symbolism ✓ - yukgaejang at fourth table (implicit
    grief ritual) + songpyeon preparation (explicit memory/love language). (2) Grief
    present but not stated ✓ - manifests through precise movements, throat tightness,
    preserved drawings, unspoken rituals; never explicitly named. (3) Estrangement
    cause specific ✓ - modernization proposal rejection, 3-year timeline, California
    relocation all concrete. (4) Regular customer ✓ - Mrs. Henderson, 20 years, Thursday
    visits, mirrors David''s grief, validates his legacy. (5) Hopeful but not unrealistically
    happy ✓ - David will teach in California, recipes preserved, relationship opening
    but restaurant lost; bittersweet resolution. (6) Korean cultural element ✓ - Jesa
    ritual performed, doenjang jjigae mentioned, songpyeon preparation detailed.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Setup (Act 1) ✓ - Notice, yukgaejang ritual, Elena''s arrival,
    unspoken tension established. Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint) ✓ - Kitchen rearrangement,
    discovered sketches, emotional core exposed. Resolution (Act 3) ✓ - Jesa table,
    songpyeon teaching moment, decision to move forward, legacy reframed as portable.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Pacing is measured and atmospheric. Sensory details (steel
    on stone, creased paper, sticky hands) ground emotion. Dialogue is sparse but
    weighted. The shift from physical preservation to emotional/culinary preservation
    is thematically coherent. Ending avoids both tragedy and false redemption. Minor:
    could have slightly more tension in Act 2, though restraint serves the tone.'
