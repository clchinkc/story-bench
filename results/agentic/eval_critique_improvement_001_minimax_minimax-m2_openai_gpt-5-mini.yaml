  evidence: 'Across rounds the draft preserved the original strong setup while adding
    clarifying details that addressed critique points: early versions established
    setting and Sarah''s routines but were lighter on linking her past; subsequent
    revisions (final) explicitly plants the Boston/Dorchester Bay hint in Act I and
    then reveals Mara in Act II, satisfying the hint-before-reveal constraint. The
    fog''s role was tightened from atmospheric to functional (hiding evidence, obscuring
    fibers, forcing Sarah to rely on sound and timing). The bait-shop owner was given
    withholding behavior and a partial revelation (the Eider), supplying a local secret.
    The end was adjusted to emphasize a lingering choice—Sarah commits to staying
    but still faces immediate tactical decisions—producing a moment of decision rather
    than full resolution.'
