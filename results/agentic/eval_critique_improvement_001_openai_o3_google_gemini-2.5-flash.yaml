  evidence: The initial versions were identical, suggesting no iterative improvement.
    However, the final output shows significant development and addresses the constraints
    well. The critiques highlighted the methodical nature, fog's purpose, and local
    secret, all of which are strongly present in the final version. The final version
    successfully incorporates all constraints and delivers a compelling narrative.
