  evidence: Versions 0–3 are essentially the same opening fragment; the major quality
    improvement occurs in the Final output, which expands the scene into a coherent
    short piece. The final adds concrete incidents (Elena repositions an IV with 'eighteen-gauge
    into the basilic vein', intubates with an '8.5' and confirms with capnography),
    a developing connection with Marcus (shared confidences, repeated stolen twenty-minute
    meetings), and the crucial ambiguous ending about the thirteen-minute pause. Good
    elements from the original fragment (pager buzzing, flu surge, Elena's composure)
    are preserved and used as scaffolding. The revision trajectory is therefore positive
    but not gradual — most feedback/changes are applied in the final pass rather than
    through steady iteration.
