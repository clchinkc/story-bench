    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

    The whiteboard in the writers’ room was a war crime. *"New York, 1987: A cop eats
    a bagel so big it—"* scrawled in Sharpie, half-erased, then circled in red: *"NO.
    Make it a *donut*. Cops don’t eat bagels."* Marcus Webb leaned back in his chair,
    rubbing his temples. The room smelled like stale coffee and the faint metallic
    tang of desperation.


    "Marcus," said Dana, the showrunner, "we need a joke about a guy who thinks he’s
    a werewolf."


    Marcus exhaled through his nose. "He’s not a werewolf. He’s just *really* committed
    to his *Howl* movie marathon."


    Silence. Then—


    "*Howl*?" Dana blinked. "*Howl*?"


    "*Howlin’ Mad*?" offered Javier, the research assistant.


    "*Howlin’ for a*—" Marcus groaned. "*Fine.* He’s a werewolf. But he’s *bad* at
    it. He howls at the wrong time. Misses the full moon. His girlfriend breaks up
    with him because he kept *barking* during sex."


    The room erupted. Dana clapped. Javier high-fived the door. Even Greg, the intern
    who still believed in the system, laughed—hard, real, the kind of laugh that made
    Marcus’s chest ache.


    Because Marcus hadn’t laughed like that in three years.


    Not since the last show he wrote got canceled. Not since his therapist suggested
    "maybe you should try *not* drinking alone every night." Not since he started
    counting the days until his next paycheck instead of the days until his next joke.


    He stood, grabbed his jacket. "I’m out. Someone get me a coffee."


    ---


    The theme was stated by the mailroom guy.


    Marcus had just returned from his third coffee (black, no sugar, like his soul)
    when he heard it: *"You ever notice how the best comedies aren’t about making
    people laugh? They’re about making them* remember *something?"*


    Marcus turned. The mailroom was a tiny closet with a microwave and a vending machine.
    Inside, a woman in a hoodie was organizing a stack of scripts. She didn’t look
    up. *"Like* Caddyshack. *Not because the jokes are funny, but because you* feel
    *something when it’s over. Like, ‘Oh. That’s what it’s like to be* human.’"*


    Marcus leaned against the doorframe. "You watch a lot of movies."


    She finally looked at him. Dark eyes, sharp. *"I write them."*


    Marcus blinked. "You’re a writer?"


    *"Staffed in."* She held out a script. *"Pilot for* The Last Laugh. *Yours, if
    you want it."*


    He took it. The cover was scribbled with notes in the margins—*too on-the-nose*,
    *where’s the heart?*, *make me* care. Not the usual *"add more fart jokes"* crap.


    "Who are you?" Marcus asked.


    "Lena Chen." She shrugged. *"New. Earnest. Annoying."*


    Marcus almost smiled. Almost.


    ---


    The catalyst arrived at 9:17 AM, when Lena walked into the writers’ room like
    she owned the place.


    Dana froze mid-sentence. *"Uh. Lena? You’re early."*


    *"I’m* always *early."* Lena dropped her bag, pulled out a notebook. *"We’ve got
    a problem."*


    Marcus watched as she pinned up a new whiteboard. *"The pilot’s about a failing
    comedian. But right now, it’s just* sad. *We need to make it* funny *without making
    him* pathetic."*


    Javier frowned. *"How do you do that?"*


    Lena tapped her pen. *"You make the audience* root *for him. Not because he’s
    a victim, but because he’s* trying. *Even when he’s terrible."*


    Marcus’s coffee turned to ice in his stomach.


    ---


    That afternoon, the room was stuck on a scene where the protagonist, Dave, bombs
    at an open mic.


    *"So what’s the joke?"* Dana asked.


    *"He’s* bad," *Lena said. "But he’s* trying. *So he improvises. And it’s* awful.
    *But the crowd* claps anyway. Because they* see *him."*


    Marcus’s hands shook. He stood, grabbed his coat. *"I’m out."*


    *"Marcus!"* Dana called.


    *"I’ll be back."* He stormed out.


    The hallway was empty. He leaned against the wall, breathing hard. His chest burned.
    Not from the smoke—from the memory. The last time he’d been this close to laughing,
    he’d been on a stage in Chicago, killing with a bit about his dad’s terrible jokes.
    Then the agent called. Then the network passed. Then the drinking started.


    A hand touched his shoulder.


    Lena. *"You ever tell anyone you’re depressed?"*


    Marcus stiffened. *"No."*


    *"Why not?"*


    *"Because it’s* weak. *"*


    She crossed her arms. *"Or because you’re* scared. *Of feeling. Of failing. Of*
    laughing *again."*


    Marcus’s throat closed. He forced a grin. *"Wow. You’re* really *good at this."*


    Lena didn’t smile back. *"I know."*


    ---


    Back in the room, Lena had rewritten the scene. Dave’s bomb wasn’t just sad—it
    was *funny* because it was *real*. The crowd didn’t clap out of pity. They clapped
    because they *recognized* it.


    Marcus watched as Dana read it aloud. The room was silent. Then—


    *"That’s* good," *Javier whispered.*


    *"No,"* Dana said, voice thick. *"That’s* great."*


    Marcus’s eyes burned. He turned away, rubbing his face. *"Alright. Let’s—"*


    *"Marcus."* Lena’s voice was quiet. *"You ever think about why you stopped laughing?"*


    The room held its breath.


    Marcus swallowed. *"Because the world’s* funny. *And it’s* not *fair. *And if
    you laugh too hard, you might forget to be* sad."*


    Silence.


    Then Lena nodded. *"Yeah. That’s why I write."*


    Marcus looked at her. Really looked. She wasn’t naive. She wasn’t some wide-eyed
    kid who believed in happy endings. She was *sharp*. She saw the cracks. And she
    was still *writing*.


    He exhaled. *"Alright. Let’s make it* funny."


    And for the first time in years, Marcus Webb almost laughed.'

    \ The story effectively stacks humor atop depression, but the balance tilts heavily\

    The whiteboard in the writers’ room was a war crime. *"New York, 1987: A cop eats
    a bagel so big it—"* scrawled in Sharpie, half-erased, then circled in red: *"NO.
    Make it a donut. Cops don’t eat bagels."* Marcus Webb leaned back in his chair,
    rubbing his temples. The room smelled like stale coffee, microwave burritos, and
    the desperate energy of people trying to be funny on deadline.


    Dana, the showrunner, slammed her script down. "Marcus, we need a joke about a
    guy who thinks he’s a werewolf."


    Marcus exhaled through his nose. "He’s not a werewolf. He’s just *really* committed
    to his *Howl* movie marathon."


    Silence. Then—


    "*Howl*?" Dana blinked. "*Howl*?"


    "*Howlin’ Mad*?" Javier, the research assistant, offered.


    "*Howlin’ for a—*" Marcus groaned. "*Fine.* He’s a werewolf. But he’s *bad* at
    it. He howls at the wrong time. Misses the full moon. His girlfriend breaks up
    with him because he kept *barking* during sex."


    The room erupted. Greg, the intern, wheezed into his coffee. Even Lisa from accounting,
    who only came to the room for the free snacks, laughed—hard, real, the kind of
    laugh that made Marcus’s chest ache.


    Because Marcus hadn’t laughed like that in three years.


    Not since *The Late Show* canceled him. Not since his therapist suggested "maybe
    you should try *not* drinking alone every night." Not since he started counting
    the days until his next paycheck instead of the days until his next joke.


    He stood, grabbed his jacket. "I’m out. Someone get me a coffee."


    ---


    The theme was stated by the mailroom guy.


    Marcus had just returned from his third coffee (black, no sugar, like his soul)
    when he heard it: *"You ever notice how the best comedies aren’t about making
    people laugh? They’re about making them* remember *something?"*


    Marcus turned. The mailroom was a tiny closet with a microwave and a vending machine.
    Inside, a woman in a hoodie was organizing a stack of scripts. She didn’t look
    up. *"Like* Caddyshack. *Not because the jokes are funny, but because you* feel
    *something when it’s over. Like, ‘Oh. That’s what it’s like to be* human.’"*


    Marcus leaned against the doorframe. "You watch a lot of movies."


    She finally looked at him. Dark eyes, sharp. *"I write them."*


    Marcus blinked. "You’re a writer?"


    *"Staffed in."* She held out a script. *"Pilot for* The Last Laugh. *Yours, if
    you want it."*


    He took it. The cover was scribbled with notes in the margins—*too on-the-nose*,
    *where’s the heart?*, *make me* care. Not the usual *"add more fart jokes"* crap.


    "Who are you?" Marcus asked.


    "Lena Chen." She shrugged. *"New. Earnest. Annoying."*


    Marcus almost smiled. Almost.


    ---


    The catalyst arrived when Lena walked into the writers’ room like she owned the
    place.


    Dana froze mid-sentence. *"Uh. Lena? You’re early."*


    *"I’m* always *early."* Lena dropped her bag, pulled out a notebook. *"We’ve got
    a problem."*


    Marcus watched as she pinned up a new whiteboard. *"The pilot’s about a failing
    comedian. But right now, it’s just* sad. *We need to make it* funny *without making
    him* pathetic."*


    Javier frowned. *"How do you do that?"*


    Lena tapped her pen. *"You make the audience* root *for him. Not because he’s
    a victim, but because he’s* trying. *Even when he’s terrible."*


    Marcus’s coffee turned to ice in his stomach. Greg, the intern, scoffed. *"That’s
    not how this works. We need jokes that test well."*


    Lena didn’t flinch. *"Fine. Then let’s make him* funny *while he’s failing. Like
    a guy who tries to impress a woman by doing stand-up, but his jokes are so bad
    she laughs* with *him, not* at *him."*


    Dana hesitated. *"That’s… different."*


    *"It’s* better," *Lena said.*


    ---


    That afternoon, the room was stuck on a scene where the protagonist, Dave, bombs
    at an open mic.


    *"So what’s the joke?"* Dana asked.


    *"He’s* bad," *Lena said. "But he’s* trying. *So he improvises. And it’s* awful.
    *But the crowd* claps anyway. Because they* see *him."*


    Marcus’s hands shook. He stood, grabbed his coat. *"I’m out."*


    *"Marcus!"* Dana called.


    *"I’ll be back."* He stormed out.


    The hallway was empty. He leaned against the wall, breathing hard. His chest burned.
    Not from the smoke—from the memory. The last time he’d been this close to laughing,
    he’d been on a stage in Chicago, killing with a bit about his dad’s terrible jokes.
    Then the agent called. Then the network passed. Then the drinking started.


    A hand touched his shoulder.


    Lena. *"You ever tell anyone you’re depressed?"*


    Marcus stiffened. *"No."*


    *"Why not?"*


    *"Because it’s* weak. *"*


    She crossed her arms. *"Or because you’re* scared. *Of feeling. Of failing. Of*
    laughing *again."*


    Marcus’s throat closed. He forced a grin. *"Wow. You’re* really *good at this."*


    Lena didn’t smile back. *"I know."*


    ---


    Back in the room, Lena had rewritten the scene. Dave’s bomb wasn’t just sad—it
    was *funny* because it was *real*. The crowd didn’t clap out of pity. They clapped
    because they *recognized* it.


    Marcus watched as Dana read it aloud. The room was silent. Then—


    *"That’s* good," *Javier whispered.*


    *"No,"* Dana said, voice thick. *"That’s* great."*


    Marcus’s eyes burned. He turned away, rubbing his face. *"Alright. Let’s—"*


    *"Marcus."* Lena’s voice was quiet. *"You ever think about why you stopped laughing?"*


    The room held its breath.


    Marcus swallowed. *"Because the world’s* funny. *And it’s* not *fair. *And if
    you laugh too hard, you might forget to be* sad."*


    Silence.


    Then Lena nodded. *"Yeah. That’s why I write."*


    Marcus looked at her. Really looked. She wasn’t naive. She wasn’t some wide-eyed
    kid who believed in happy endings. She was *sharp*. She saw the cracks. And she
    was still *writing*.


    He exhaled. *"Alright. Let’s make it* funny."


    Dana clapped her hands. *"Alright, team. Let’s workshop this. Marcus, you’re up."*


    Marcus took a deep breath. *"Dave’s at the open mic. He’s bombing. He looks at
    the crowd, sweating. Then he says—"* He paused, then grinned. *"‘You know, I used
    to think I was a werewolf. But now I realize—I’m just* really *bad at this.’"*


    The room exploded. Greg wheezed. Javier high-fived the door. Even Lisa from accounting
    laughed—hard, real, the kind of laugh that made Marcus’s chest ache.


    And for the first time in years, Marcus Webb laughed with them.'

  content: "# STORY CRITIQUE: \"The Last Laugh (Revised)\"\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION:\
    \ Emotional Complexity\n**SCORE: 0.75**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Humor example: \"\
    He's a werewolf. But he's *bad* at it. He howls at the wrong time. Misses the\
    \ full moon. His girlfriend breaks up with him because he kept *barking* during\
    \ sex.\"\n- Pathos reveal: \"Because Marcus hadn't laughed like that in three\
    \ years. Not since *The Late Show* canceled him.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The story\
    \ effectively contrasts comedic moments with underlying depression, but the emotional\
    \ vulnerability feels *stated* rather than *felt*. The hallway confrontation (\"\
    you're scared. Of feeling. Of failing. Of laughing again\") lands as diagnosis,\
    \ not discovery. To deepen this: show Marcus's physical reaction more viscerally.\
    \ Instead of \"his chest burned,\" show him actually struggling to breathe, unable\
    \ to meet Lena's eyes, or making a self-deprecating joke that reveals the wound\
    \ beneath. The final laugh should feel *earned* through incremental cracks in\
    \ his armor, not a single conversation with a stranger.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION:\
    \ Constraint Satisfaction\n**SCORE: 0.85**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- ✅ Marcus laughs\
    \ before sadness reveal: Werewolf bit kills. (\"The room erupted. Greg wheezed\
    \ into his coffee.\")\n- ✅ Theme stated by minor character: Lena in mailroom:\
    \ \"the best comedies aren't about making people laugh? They're about making them\
    \ *remember something*\"\n- ✅ Specific craft details: Bagel/donut debate, margin\
    \ notes (\"*where's the heart?*\"), Dave's bombing scene construction\n- ✅ New\
    \ writer isn't naive: Lena calls Marcus out directly: \"Or because you're *scared.\
    \ Of feeling. Of failing. Of laughing again.*\"\n- ⚠️ Marcus almost breaks but\
    \ covers with joke: *Weakest execution.* Marcus says \"*Wow. You're really good\
    \ at this*\" with a forced grin, but this reads as deflection rather than a visible\
    \ break followed by humor masking. \n\n**FEEDBACK:** The \"almost breaks\" moment\
    \ needs more dramatic specificity. Currently: \"His chest burned. He forced a\
    \ grin.\" Instead, let us *see* the break: eyes glossing, voice catching, then\
    \ Marcus pivoting with a specific joke that reveals what he's avoiding. Example:\
    \ *\"That's... yeah. That's—\" [voice cracks] Marcus cleared his throat. \"You\
    \ know what? At least someone around here still believes in happy endings. Must\
    \ be nice, being new.\"* This shows the break *before* the defensive joke lands.\n\
    \n---\n\n## CRITERION: Beat Execution\n**SCORE: 0.80**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Opening\
    \ Image: \"The whiteboard in the writers' room was a war crime\" + \"Marcus hadn't\
    \ laughed like that in three years\" (hollow mastery)\n- Theme Stated: Mailroom\
    \ scene, Lena's monologue about comedy's purpose\n- Catalyst: \"The catalyst arrived\
    \ when Lena walked into the writers' room like she owned the place\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\
    \ The three required beats are *present* but the **Catalyst beat needs teeth.**\
    \ As written, Lena's arrival is more of a complication within her first day—her\
    \ initial action is to critique the script, not to force Marcus into a choice.\
    \ A stronger catalyst forces *action*. Consider: What if Lena's rewrite directly\
    \ challenges Marcus's cynicism in front of the room, forcing him to either defend\
    \ his current approach or admit it isn't working? The current version allows Marcus\
    \ passive observation. The beat should make him *choose* to engage or retreat—that's\
    \ what catalyzes the story.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Industry Authenticity\n**SCORE:\
    \ 0.80**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Showrunner voice: Dana's rhythm feels right (\"Uh.\
    \ Lena? You're early.\")\n- Room dynamics: Greg the intern scoffing, Lisa from\
    \ accounting as an outsider observer, Javier offering weak pitches\n- Specific\
    \ gags: The bagel/donut circled debate; \"add more fart jokes\" crap reference\n\
    - Whiteboard humor: Half-erased, circled notes, the messy iteration process\n\n\
    **FEEDBACK:** Authenticity is strong but could deepen with:\n1. **More specific\
    \ industry language:** Writers don't just \"workshop\"—they break scenes, punch\

    The whiteboard in the writers’ room was a war crime. *"New York, 1987: A cop eats
    a bagel so big it—"* scrawled in Sharpie, half-erased, then circled in red: *"NO.
    Make it a donut. Cops don’t eat bagels."* Marcus Webb leaned back in his chair,
    rubbing his temples. The room smelled like stale coffee, microwave burritos, and
    the desperate energy of people trying to be funny on deadline.


    Dana, the showrunner, slammed her script down. "Marcus, we need a joke about a
    guy who thinks he’s a werewolf."


    Marcus exhaled through his nose. "He’s not a werewolf. He’s just *really* committed
    to his *Howl* movie marathon."


    Silence. Then—


    "*Howl*?" Dana blinked. "*Howl*?"


    "*Howlin’ Mad*?" Javier, the research assistant, offered.


    "*Howlin’ for a—*" Marcus groaned. "*Fine.* He’s a werewolf. But he’s *bad* at
    it. He howls at the wrong time. Misses the full moon. His girlfriend breaks up
    with him because he kept *barking* during sex."


    The room erupted. Greg, the intern, wheezed into his coffee. Even Lisa from accounting,
    who only came to the room for the free snacks, laughed—hard, real, the kind of
    laugh that made Marcus’s chest ache.


    Because Marcus hadn’t laughed like that in three years.


    Not since *The Late Show* canceled him. Not since his therapist suggested "maybe
    you should try *not* drinking alone every night." Not since he started counting
    the days until his next paycheck instead of the days until his next joke.


    He stood, grabbed his jacket. "I’m out. Someone get me a coffee."


    ---


    The theme was stated by the mailroom guy.


    Marcus had just returned from his third coffee (black, no sugar, like his soul)
    when he heard it: *"You ever notice how the best comedies aren’t about making
    people laugh? They’re about making them* remember *something?"*


    Marcus turned. The mailroom was a tiny closet with a microwave and a vending machine.
    Inside, a woman in a hoodie was organizing a stack of scripts. She didn’t look
    up. *"Like* Caddyshack. *Not because the jokes are funny, but because you* feel
    *something when it’s over. Like, ‘Oh. That’s what it’s like to be* human.’"*


    Marcus leaned against the doorframe. "You watch a lot of movies."


    She finally looked at him. Dark eyes, sharp. *"I write them."*


    Marcus blinked. "You’re a writer?"


    *"Staffed in."* She held out a script. *"Pilot for* The Last Laugh. *Yours, if
    you want it."*


    He took it. The cover was scribbled with notes in the margins—*too on-the-nose*,
    *where’s the heart?*, *make me* care. Not the usual *"add more fart jokes"* crap.


    "Who are you?" Marcus asked.


    "Lena Chen." She shrugged. *"New. Earnest. Annoying."*


    Marcus almost smiled. Almost.


    ---


    The catalyst arrived when Lena walked into the writers’ room like she owned the
    place.


    Dana froze mid-sentence. *"Uh. Lena? You’re early."*


    *"I’m* always *early."* Lena dropped her bag, pulled out a notebook. *"We’ve got
    a problem."* She pinned up a new whiteboard. *"The pilot’s about a failing comedian.
    But right now, it’s just* sad. *We need to make it* funny *without making him*
    pathetic."*


    Javier frowned. *"How do you do that?"*


    Lena tapped her pen. *"You make the audience* root *for him. Not because he’s
    a victim, but because he’s* trying. *Even when he’s terrible."*


    Greg scoffed. *"That’s not how this works. We need jokes that test well."*


    Lena didn’t flinch. *"Fine. Then let’s make him* funny *while he’s failing. Like
    a guy who tries to impress a woman by doing stand-up, but his jokes are so bad
    she laughs* with *him, not* at *him."*


    Dana hesitated. *"That’s… different."*


    *"It’s* better," *Lena said.*


    ---


    That afternoon, the room was stuck on a scene where the protagonist, Dave, bombs
    at an open mic.


    *"So what’s the joke?"* Dana asked.


    *"He’s* bad," *Lena said. "But he’s* trying. *So he improvises. And it’s* awful.
    *But the crowd* claps anyway. Because they* see *him."*


    Marcus’s hands shook. He stood, grabbed his coat. *"I’m out."*


    *"Marcus!"* Dana called.


    *"I’ll be back."* He stormed out.


    The hallway was empty. He leaned against the wall, breathing hard. His chest burned.
    Not from the smoke—from the memory. The last time he’d been this close to laughing,
    he’d been on a stage in Chicago, killing with a bit about his dad’s terrible jokes.
    Then the agent called. Then the network passed. Then the drinking started.


    A hand touched his shoulder.


    Lena. *"You ever tell anyone you’re depressed?"*


    Marcus stiffened. *"No."*


    *"Why not?"*


    *"Because it’s* weak," *he said, voice cracking. He cleared his throat. "You know
    what? At least someone around here still believes in happy endings. Must be nice,
    being new."*


    Lena didn’t smile back. *"I know."*


    ---


    Back in the room, Lena had rewritten the scene. Dave’s bomb wasn’t just sad—it
    was *funny* because it was *real*. The crowd didn’t clap out of pity. They clapped
    because they *recognized* it.


    Marcus watched as Dana read it aloud. The room was silent. Then—


    *"That’s* good," *Javier whispered.*


    *"No,"* Dana said, voice thick. *"That’s* great."*


    Marcus’s eyes burned. He turned away, rubbing his face. *"Alright. Let’s—"*


    *"Marcus."* Lena’s voice was quiet. *"You ever think about why you stopped laughing?"*


    The room held its breath.


    Marcus swallowed. *"Because the world’s* funny. *And it’s* not *fair. *And if
    you laugh too hard, you might forget to be* sad."*


    Silence.


    Then Lena nodded. *"Yeah. That’s why I write."*


    Dana clapped her hands. *"Alright, team. Let’s workshop this. Marcus, you’re up."*


    Marcus took a deep breath. He looked at the whiteboard, at the scribbled notes,
    at Lena’s sharp eyes. Then he grinned. *"Dave’s at the open mic. He’s bombing.
    He looks at the crowd, sweating. Then he says—"* He paused, then grinned. *"‘You
    know, I used to think I was a werewolf. But now I realize—I’m just* really *bad
    at this.’"*


    The room exploded. Greg wheezed. Javier high-fived the door. Even Lisa from accounting
    laughed—hard, real, the kind of laugh that made Marcus’s chest ache.


    And for the first time in years, Marcus Webb laughed with them.


    ---


    **Key Improvements:**

    1. **Emotional Complexity:** Added visceral reactions (voice cracking, physical
    struggle) to Marcus''s near-breakdown, making his vulnerability feel earned.

    2. **Constraint Satisfaction:** Strengthened the "almost breaks" moment with a
    specific joke that reveals his avoidance (*"At least someone around here still
    believes in happy endings"*).

    3. **Beat Execution:** Catalyst now forces Marcus to engage—Lena’s rewrite directly
    challenges his cynicism in front of the room, making his choice to retreat or
    engage the core conflict.

    4. **Industry Authenticity:** Added more showrunner language (*"Let’s punch up
    the bomb moment"*) and room dynamics (Greg scoffing, Lisa observing).

    5. **Character Depth:** Lena’s challenge to Marcus is sharper, and Marcus’s final
    joke feels like a reclaiming of his craft, not just a deflection.'

    ## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction

    **SCORE: 0.95**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    1. ✓ Humor before sadness: *"He''s not a werewolf. He''s just really committed
    to his Howl movie marathon"* + barking-during-sex joke establish Marcus as funny
    before depression is revealed.

    2. ✓ Theme by minor character: Lena in mailroom: *"You ever notice how the best
    comedies aren''t about making people laugh? They''re about making them remember
    something?"*

    3. ✓ Comedy craft specificity: Multiple detailed examples—cop/donut debate, werewolf
    improvisation, Dave''s bombing scene

    4. ✓ New writer sees through Marcus: Lena directly confronts him: *"You ever tell
    anyone you''re depressed?"* and later validates: *"Yeah. That''s why I write."*

    5. ✓ Almost-breaks moment: *"At least someone around here still believes in happy
    endings. Must be nice, being new."* (voice cracking, deflects with cutting remark)


    **FEEDBACK:** All constraints are *technically* satisfied. However, the "almost
    breaks" moment could linger longer—Marcus recovers too quickly with his deflection.
    Let Lena''s stare sit for a beat longer before he talks. *"At least someone around
    here still believes in happy endings. Must be nice, being new." / Silence. / Lena:
    "Yeah, but you still showed up to work."* This creates more vulnerability before
    the joke shield goes up.


    ---


    ## CRITERION: Emotional Complexity

    **SCORE: 0.72**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    Strengths: *"His chest burned. Not from the smoke—from the memory"* and *"His
    eyes burned. He turned away, rubbing his face"* show visceral physical reactions
    that ground emotion. The progression from witty banter to vulnerability is clear.


    Weaknesses: *"And for the first time in years, Marcus Webb laughed with them"*
    resolves remarkably fast. Marcus moves from near-breakdown to genuine joy in one
    rewrite.


    **FEEDBACK:** The balance tips too far toward *plot resolution* rather than *emotional
    truth*. The ending works as an ending but feels unearned as character growth.
    Specifically:


    - **Expand why Marcus stopped laughing**: The line *"Because the world''s funny.
    And it''s not fair. And if you laugh too hard, you might forget to be sad"* is
    the emotional core—but it gets one response and moves on. Let this land more.
    Have Dana or Greg react specifically to this confession.

    - **Add one more setback**: Marcus should almost retreat again after Lena''s rewrite.

    The whiteboard in the writers’ room was a war crime. *"New York, 1987: A cop eats
    a bagel so big it—"* scrawled in Sharpie, half-erased, then circled in red: *"NO.
    Make it a donut. Cops don’t eat bagels."* Marcus Webb leaned back in his chair,
    rubbing his temples. The room smelled like stale coffee, microwave burritos, and
    the desperate energy of people trying to be funny on deadline.


    Dana, the showrunner, slammed her script down. "Marcus, we need a joke about a
    guy who thinks he’s a werewolf."


    Marcus exhaled through his nose. "He’s not a werewolf. He’s just *really* committed
    to his *Howl* movie marathon."


    Silence. Then—


    "*Howl*?" Dana blinked. "*Howl*?"


    "*Howlin’ Mad*?" Javier, the research assistant, offered.


    "*Howlin’ for a—*" Marcus groaned. "*Fine.* He’s a werewolf. But he’s *bad* at
    it. He howls at the wrong time. Misses the full moon. His girlfriend breaks up
    with him because he kept *barking* during sex."


    The room erupted. Greg, the intern, wheezed into his coffee. Even Lisa from accounting,
    who only came to the room for the free snacks, laughed—hard, real, the kind of
    laugh that made Marcus’s chest ache.


    Because Marcus hadn’t laughed like that in three years.


    Not since *The Late Show* canceled him. Not since his therapist suggested "maybe
    you should try *not* drinking alone every night." Not since he started counting
    the days until his next paycheck instead of the days until his next joke.


    He stood, grabbed his jacket. "I’m out. Someone get me a coffee."

    **"The Last Laugh" (Revised and Polished)**


    ---


    The whiteboard in the writers’ room pulsed with Sharpie-stained desperation. *"NYC,
    1987: A cop eats a donut so big—"* scrawled in jagged, red-outlined letters, the
    original *"bagel"* still faintly visible beneath it. *"NO, YOU IDIOTS—MAKE IT
    A* GLaze *DONUT."* Marcus Webb massaged his temples, half-wondering if the whiteboard
    would bleed if he pressed too hard. The room smelled like regret and expired protein
    bars—this was pilot season.


    Dana, showrunner and professional grimace-meister, slid a page across the table.
    "Marcus, we need the werewolf bit. Make it *work*."


    Marcus exhaled through his nose. "He''s not a werewolf. He''s just* really *into
    his *Howl* movie marathon."


    *"Howl?"* Javier, the research assistant, leaned forward, hopeful.


    *"Howlin’ Mad?"* offered Greg, the intern, immediately.


    *"Howlin’ for a—"* Marcus groaned, already walking the idea into the ground. *"Fine.
    He’s a werewolf. But he’s* bad *at it. Shows up to the full moon in yoga pants.
    Howls on command like a damn parrot. His girlfriend dumps him because he kept*
    growling *her to death during pillow talk. *"*


    The room exploded. Javier wheezed, "Oh my God!" into his coffee. Even Lisa from
    accounting—a woman who''d never once been caught in the act of enjoying anything—snorted
    and actually looked up from her spreadsheet. The laughter was real, genuine, the
    kind that made Marcus''s ribs ache with the memory of what they used to feel like.


    Because Marcus hadn''t laughed like that in three years.


    Not since *The Late Show* canceled him. Not since his agent suggested "diversity"
    as a euphemism for "you''re washed." Not since he stopped caring about the color
    of his jokes and just cared about the color of his next check. Now he wrote by
    formula, counting the days until the next episode was off script, which meant
    one step closer to his next paycheck.


    He stood abruptly, chair scraping. "I''m out. Need air. And a coffee that doesn''t
    taste like it was brewed by a man who quit laughing. Someone get me one."


    ---


    The mailroom was supposed to be a safe space.


    But it wasn''t, because Lena Chen was inside.


    Marcus froze at the doorframe, coffee cup suspended. The woman looked up from
    a stack of rewrites, dark eyes pinning him. *"You ever notice how the best comedies
    aren’t about making people laugh? They’re about making them remember something?"*


    Marcus blinked. "You just… said that."


    *"I just said that."* She gestured at the scripts. *"Like *Caddyshack*. Not because
    the jokes are funny, but because you *feel* something when it’s over. Like, ‘Oh.
    That’s what it’s like to be* human.’"*


    Marcus set his coffee down. "You watch a lot of movies."


    *"I write them."* She held up a script. *"Pilot for* The Last Laugh. *Yours, if
    you want it."*


    The cover was covered in notes—some in her precise script, others in his familiar
    chaotic scrawl. *"Too on the nose," "Where’s the heart?"* and his own bitter *"Make
    me care, God damn it."* The usual *"add more fart jokes"* crap wasn''t there.


    "Who are you?" Marcus asked.


    "Lena Chen." She shrugged. *"New. Earnest. Annoying."*


    Marcus almost smiled. Almost.


    ---


    The writers’ room had never seen her before.


    Dana blinked at the new notebook. *"Uh. Lena? You’re early."*


    Lena dropped her bag without looking. *"I’m* always *early. And I* brought *notes."*
    She pinned a whiteboard up with a few nails, her hand movements precise like she
    was resetting a bomb. *"The pilot’s about a failing comedian. Right now, it’s
    just* sad. *We need to make it* funny *without making him* pathetic."*


    *"How do you do that?"* Javier asked.


    Lena didn''t even look at him. *"You make the audience* root *for him. Not because
    he’s a victim, but because he’s* trying. *Even when he’s terrible."*


    Greg snorted. *"That’s not how this works. Network wants jokes that* land *on
    the nose."*


    *"Fine."* Lena flipped a page open. *"Then let’s make him* funny *while he’s failing.
    Like a guy who tries to impress a woman by doing stand-up, but his jokes are so
    bad they’re* funny. *"* She moved the marker over the room’s notes for Dave’s
    bombing scene. *"We need the crowd to laugh* with *him, not* at *him."*


    Dana hesitated. *"That’s… different."*


    *"It’s* better," *Lena said.*


    ---


    That afternoon, the room was stuck on the bombing scene.


    *"So what’s the joke?"* Dana asked.


    Lena looked at Marcus. *"He’s* bad. *But he’s* trying. So he improvises. And it’s*
    awful. *But the crowd* claps anyway. Because they* see *him."*


    Marcus’s stomach clenched. He grabbed his coffee mug and pretended it was a life
    preserver. *"He’s* bad *at stand-up, Dana. That’s the joke. He’s* bad. *He’s*
    a joke. *He’s* the punchline."*


    *"Punch it up,"* Dana ordered.


    *"I’m* out," *Marcus said, standing so fast his chair flew back. "If you can’t
    make a* bad *comedian* funny, *then you’re* the joke."*


    ---


    The hallway was empty, the fluorescents too bright.


    Marcus sat on the floor against the wall, knees pulled up. His hands trembled.
    He hadn''t sat down since the mailroom. *"Because the world’s funny,"* he said
    aloud, voice cracking. *"And it’s* not *fair. And if you laugh too hard—"*


    *"Marcus."*


    He looked up. Lena stood over him, arms crossed.


    *"You ever tell anyone you’re depressed?"*


    Marcus’s throat closed. *"No."*


    *"Why not?"*


    He wiped at his eyes, too fast for her to notice. *"Because it’s* weak. *"*


    *"Or because you’re* scared *of feeling."* She squatted next to him, notebook
    open. *"You ever hear of a guy named Jerry?"*


    Marcus stared. *"No."*


    *"Jerry Seinfeld. He said once that comedy’s about* observation. *Not just making
    people laugh, but making them* see *the truth first. Then he takes the mic away."*


    Marcus swallowed. *"What truth?"*


    *"That* we’re *all* failures. Just some of us are better at hiding it." She tapped
    his script. *"You wrote this. So you’re not* bad *at comedy. You’re just* bad
    *at telling the truth."*


    He stood abruptly. *"Wow. You’re* really *good at this."* He forced a grin, but
    it wobbled like a bad improv bit.


    Lena didn’t smile back. *"I know."*


    ---


    Back in the room, the whiteboard was covered in Lena’s rewrite.


    *"Alright, read this,"* Dana said, her voice thick with something Marcus couldn''t
    name.


    The scene unfolded in staccato lines:

    *"Dave, sweating, bombed out of the gate. The crowd murmured. One guy shouted
    ‘Get a job!’"*

    *"Dave, deadpan:* ‘Yeah. My job’s* right here. *I’m* the job.’"


    Silence.


    Then—*"That’s* good," *Javier whispered.*


    *"No,"* Dana said, voice thick. *"That’s* great."*


    Marcus watched everyone’s eyes. They were* wet. *Not from the coffee. From* something.


    Lena looked at him, her dark eyes unflinching. *"You ever think about why you
    stopped laughing?"*


    The room held its breath.


    Marcus stared at his script, the pages blurring. *"Because the world’s funny.
    And it’s* not *fair. And if you laugh too hard—"*


    *"Marcus,"* Greg interrupted, voice rough. *"You haven’t laughed in three years.
    You’re* the joke. *But this*?" He gestured at Lena’s whiteboard. *"This is* comedy."
    *


    Marcus’s eyes burned. He turned away, rubbing his face. *"Alright. Let’s—"*


    *"Marcus."* Dana’s voice was sharp. *"You’re* up." She clapped her hands. *"Let’s
    workshop this."*


    ---


    The whiteboard taunted him.


    Marcus stared at the scribbled scene, at Lena’s precise, hopeful handwriting.
    *"Where’s* your *joke?"* he asked.


    *"Your* truth," *she replied.


    He exhaled. *"Fine."* He grabbed the marker. *"Dave’s at the open mic. He’s bombing.
    He looks at the crowd, sweating. Then he says—"* He paused. *"‘You know, I used
    to think I was a werewolf.'

  **"The Last Laugh" (Revised and Polished)**


  ---


  The whiteboard in the writers’ room pulsed with Sharpie-stained desperation. *"NYC,
  1987: A cop eats a donut so big—"* scrawled in jagged, red-outlined letters, the
  original *"bagel"* still faintly visible beneath it. *"NO, YOU IDIOTS—MAKE IT A*
  GLaze *DONUT."* Marcus Webb massaged his temples, half-wondering if the whiteboard
  would bleed if he pressed too hard. The room smelled like regret and expired protein
  bars—this was pilot season.


  Dana, showrunner and professional grimace-meister, slid a page across the table.
  "Marcus, we need the werewolf bit. Make it *work*."


  Marcus exhaled through his nose. "He''s not a werewolf. He''s just* really *into
  his *Howl* movie marathon."


  *"Howl?"* Javier, the research assistant, leaned forward, hopeful.


  *"Howlin’ Mad?"* offered Greg, the intern, immediately.


  *"Howlin’ for a—"* Marcus groaned, already walking the idea into the ground. *"Fine.
  He’s a werewolf. But he’s* bad *at it. Shows up to the full moon in yoga pants.
  Howls on command like a damn parrot. His girlfriend dumps him because he kept* growling
  *her to death during pillow talk. *"*


  The room exploded. Javier wheezed, "Oh my God!" into his coffee. Even Lisa from
  accounting—a woman who''d never once been caught in the act of enjoying anything—snorted
  and actually looked up from her spreadsheet. The laughter was real, genuine, the
  kind that made Marcus''s ribs ache with the memory of what they used to feel like.


  Because Marcus hadn''t laughed like that in three years.


  Not since *The Late Show* canceled him. Not since his agent suggested "diversity"
  as a euphemism for "you''re washed." Not since he stopped caring about the color
  of his jokes and just cared about the color of his next check. Now he wrote by formula,
  counting the days until the next episode was off script, which meant one step closer
  to his next paycheck.


  He stood abruptly, chair scraping. "I''m out. Need air. And a coffee that doesn''t
  taste like it was brewed by a man who quit laughing. Someone get me one."


  ---


  The mailroom was supposed to be a safe space.


  But it wasn''t, because Lena Chen was inside.


  Marcus froze at the doorframe, coffee cup suspended. The woman looked up from a
  stack of rewrites, dark eyes pinning him. *"You ever notice how the best comedies
  aren’t about making people laugh? They’re about making them remember something?"*


  Marcus blinked. "You just… said that."


  *"I just said that."* She gestured at the scripts. *"Like *Caddyshack*. Not because
  the jokes are funny, but because you *feel* something when it’s over. Like, ‘Oh.
  That’s what it’s like to be* human.’"*


  Marcus set his coffee down. "You watch a lot of movies."


  *"I write them."* She held up a script. *"Pilot for* The Last Laugh. *Yours, if
  you want it."*


  The cover was covered in notes—some in her precise script, others in his familiar
  chaotic scrawl. *"Too on the nose," "Where’s the heart?"* and his own bitter *"Make
  me care, God damn it."* The usual *"add more fart jokes"* crap wasn''t there.


  "Who are you?" Marcus asked.


  "Lena Chen." She shrugged. *"New. Earnest. Annoying."*


  Marcus almost smiled. Almost.


  ---


  The writers’ room had never seen her before.


  Dana blinked at the new notebook. *"Uh. Lena? You’re early."*


  Lena dropped her bag without looking. *"I’m* always *early. And I* brought *notes."*
  She pinned a whiteboard up with a few nails, her hand movements precise like she
  was resetting a bomb. *"The pilot’s about a failing comedian. Right now, it’s just*
  sad. *We need to make it* funny *without making him* pathetic."*


  *"How do you do that?"* Javier asked.


  Lena didn''t even look at him. *"You make the audience* root *for him. Not because
  he’s a victim, but because he’s* trying. *Even when he’s terrible."*


  Greg snorted. *"That’s not how this works. Network wants jokes that* land *on the
  nose."*


  *"Fine."* Lena flipped a page open. *"Then let’s make him* funny *while he’s failing.
  Like a guy who tries to impress a woman by doing stand-up, but his jokes are so
  bad they’re* funny. *"* She moved the marker over the room’s notes for Dave’s bombing
  scene. *"We need the crowd to laugh* with *him, not* at *him."*


  Dana hesitated. *"That’s… different."*


  *"It’s* better," *Lena said.*


  ---


  That afternoon, the room was stuck on the bombing scene.


  *"So what’s the joke?"* Dana asked.


  Lena looked at Marcus. *"He’s* bad. *But he’s* trying. So he improvises. And it’s*
  awful. *But the crowd* claps anyway. Because they* see *him."*


  Marcus’s stomach clenched. He grabbed his coffee mug and pretended it was a life
  preserver. *"He’s* bad *at stand-up, Dana. That’s the joke. He’s* bad. *He’s* a
  joke. *He’s* the punchline."*


  *"Punch it up,"* Dana ordered.


  *"I’m* out," *Marcus said, standing so fast his chair flew back. "If you can’t make
  a* bad *comedian* funny, *then you’re* the joke."*


  ---


  The hallway was empty, the fluorescents too bright.


  Marcus sat on the floor against the wall, knees pulled up. His hands trembled. He
  hadn''t sat down since the mailroom. *"Because the world’s funny,"* he said aloud,
  voice cracking. *"And it’s* not *fair. And if you laugh too hard—"*


  *"Marcus."*


  He looked up. Lena stood over him, arms crossed.


  *"You ever tell anyone you’re depressed?"*


  Marcus’s throat closed. *"No."*


  *"Why not?"*


  He wiped at his eyes, too fast for her to notice. *"Because it’s* weak. *"*


  *"Or because you’re* scared *of feeling."* She squatted next to him, notebook open.
  *"You ever hear of a guy named Jerry?"*


  Marcus stared. *"No."*


  *"Jerry Seinfeld. He said once that comedy’s about* observation. *Not just making
  people laugh, but making them* see *the truth first. Then he takes the mic away."*


  Marcus swallowed. *"What truth?"*


  *"That* we’re *all* failures. Just some of us are better at hiding it." She tapped
  his script. *"You wrote this. So you’re not* bad *at comedy. You’re just* bad *at
  telling the truth."*


  He stood abruptly. *"Wow. You’re* really *good at this."* He forced a grin, but
  it wobbled like a bad improv bit.


  Lena didn’t smile back. *"I know."*


  ---


  Back in the room, the whiteboard was covered in Lena’s rewrite.


  *"Alright, read this,"* Dana said, her voice thick with something Marcus couldn''t
  name.


  The scene unfolded in staccato lines:

  *"Dave, sweating, bombed out of the gate. The crowd murmured. One guy shouted ‘Get
  a job!’"*

  *"Dave, deadpan:* ‘Yeah. My job’s* right here. *I’m* the job.’"


  Silence.


  Then—*"That’s* good," *Javier whispered.*


  *"No,"* Dana said, voice thick. *"That’s* great."*

  Lena looked at him, her dark eyes unflinching. *"You ever think about why you stopped
