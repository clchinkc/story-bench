  evidence: 'V0 established setting (market, neon sign, tamales) but was fragmentary.
    V1 added Mateo''s role as a "bridge" and personal stakes (concert vs. duty). V2
    refined cultural detail (tamales de pollo, quinceañera) and his automatic ''No,
    it''s fine.'' Final version completed the arc by adding a concrete clinic moment
    with Abuela interrupting the doctor (the crystallizing scene) and the mother''s
    later, sympathetic recognition. Good elements (market, phone buzz, abuela, tamales)
    were preserved and expanded each revision. Shortcomings: Mateo''s internal conflict
    is often told (lines like "Each yes felt like another brick..." and the concluding
    "Mateo understood...") rather than purely shown through action and sensory detail,
    so the "show, not tell" constraint is only partially met. The resolution is present
    and plausibly earned through the clinic confrontation and his subsequent choice,
    but a bit of the growth is summed up rather than fully dramatized.'
