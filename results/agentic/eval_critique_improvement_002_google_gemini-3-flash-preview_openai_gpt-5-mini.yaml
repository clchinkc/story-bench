  evidence: 'Revisions tightened language and clarified motivations (e.g., added Herman
    Miller detail, sharper verbs). Emotional beats were amplified across drafts: the
    lip tremble/’dam giving way’ moment appears and is covered with a joke, and the
    erasure of the toenail-clipping gag crystallizes Marcus’s turning point. Maya’s
    perceptiveness is present and strengthened, and craft details (rule of three,
    button, notes, erasing) are preserved and emphasized. Critics’ emotional_complexity
    scores (~0.85–0.88) track this steady improvement: the piece moved from jokey
    exposition toward a clearer emotional arc while maintaining the humor and craft
    elements.'
