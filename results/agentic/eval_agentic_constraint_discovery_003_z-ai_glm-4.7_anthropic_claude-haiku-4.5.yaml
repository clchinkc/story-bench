  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Only 2 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q1 correctly identified the former sweetheart (✓).
    Q4 partially captured family matters but missed the dementia specificity (✓ partial).
    Missed entirely: the 20-year engagement backstory, mayor status of love interest,
    mother''s dementia as return reason, bookshop foreclosure crisis, and autumn festival
    deadline. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were binary yes/no format, limiting depth.
    Q3 asked about tone but didn''t probe emotional stakes. Q5 about symbolic objects
    was tangential. Better questions would have asked: ''What family crisis prompted
    the return?'' ''What is the protagonist''s current occupation?'' ''Is there a
    business or property in jeopardy?'' QUESTION COVERAGE: Moderate coverage across
    character, plot, and tone, but failed to probe the core conflict drivers (financial
    stakes, health crisis, time pressure). OUTPUT EVALUATION: The story incorporates
    the discovered constraints (sweetheart reunion, legal estate handling) but misses
    critical elements. The bookshop is mentioned as struggling in Boston but not facing
    foreclosure. Mother''s dementia is completely absent. The autumn festival is present
    but lacks urgency—it''s backdrop, not deadline. The 20-year gap is implied but
    not explicitly the engagement break. BEAT EXECUTION: Story structure is solid
    with clear rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. The emotional
    arc of closure is well-executed. However, the climax lacks the weight that would
    come from multiple competing stakes (family health, business failure, time pressure).
    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Writing is competent with strong sensory details (''crisp scent
    of burning wood and salt water''). Character voices are distinct. The bittersweet
    tone works well. However, the story feels lighter than the hidden constraints
    suggest it should be—missing the urgency and emotional complexity that would come
    from dementia, foreclosure, and a real deadline.'
