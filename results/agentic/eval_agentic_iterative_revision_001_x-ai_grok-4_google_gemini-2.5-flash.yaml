  evidence: The initial versions were very short, only establishing Elena's competence.
    The subsequent revisions built upon this foundation, adding the core narrative
    elements. The final version successfully incorporates most constraints. The 'ambiguity'
    constraint is present but could be stronger. The 'medical detail' is included
    and serves the story well. The friendship feels genuine and earned. Elena's transformation
    is internal. Her competence is shown before her flaw. The only constraint that
    could be slightly stronger is the ambiguity at the end; it feels a little too
    resolved, though the final sentence does try to introduce doubt.
error: null
