    STORY THEORY: Story Circle


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker
    who has

    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for

    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.


    - Central conflict: When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will
    take 6 months,

    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting

    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.


    - Tone: Quietly profound, observant, gently humorous


    REQUIRED BEATS: You (comfort zone), Need (want something), Go (unfamiliar situation),
    Search (adapt to it)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Teddy''s routine must be shown with specific, loving detail

    - The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been avoiding

    - Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s

    - Teddy''s late wife must be present through absence

    - The new path must offer something the old path couldn''t


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - character_interiority: Is Teddy''s inner life rich and specific?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Story Circle beats properly executed?

    - subtlety: Are emotions conveyed through action and detail, not exposition?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and resonance


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

    At 6:47 AM, Teddy Washington stepped onto his porch and checked the sky—clear,
    with that October bite that made his knuckles ache just enough to remind him he
    was still here. He''d been stepping out at 6:47 for forty years, three minutes
    after the coffee finished brewing, two minutes before old Mrs. Chen started her
    tai chi in the park.


    His route was scripture: left on Corktown, past the blue house where the Kowalski
    kids once played stickball, right on Michigan Avenue where Sal''s Diner served
    eggs exactly how Dorothy liked them—over easy, whites still trembling. Three miles
    that looped through his life like prayer beads, each landmark a small genuflection
    to the rhythm that had carried him through Dorothy''s diagnosis, her treatments,
    her funeral, and the 2,847 mornings since.


    This morning, orange cones and a bulldozer had planted themselves where Corktown
    met Michigan. A hard-hatted woman with a clipboard held up her hand.


    "Six months of water main work," she said. "You''ll have to go around."


    Teddy stared at the barricade as if it might dissolve. Behind the woman, a crew
    was already tearing up the sidewalk where he''d walked Dorothy to her last doctor''s
    appointment, where he''d counted her slowing steps and pretended not to notice
    her holding the fence for support.


    "Around where?" he asked.


    The woman shrugged and pointed east. "However you want to get there."


    *However you want to get there.* As if he''d been choosing all along.


    Teddy turned east onto Vernon, a street he''d glimpsed a thousand times but never
    traveled. The houses here sat closer together, their porches thick with morning
    conversation. An elderly Black man in a threadbare cardigan was hand-watering
    petunias with a coffee can. When he saw Teddy, he nodded.


    "Morning. You''re the mailman from Corktown."


    "Retired mailman," Teddy corrected. "Just walking."


    "I''m James. Been watching you pass my corner for years. Always wondered where
    you were walking to."


    Teddy had no answer. Home, he supposed, though the loop brought him exactly where
    he started.


    "These yours?" Teddy gestured to the flowers.


    "My late wife''s. Promised her I''d keep them going." James''s smile held forty-year-old
    grief made gentle. "Can''t say I have the touch, but I show up."


    As Teddy continued down Vernon, he found himself noticing things his peripheral
    vision had missed: the house with hand-painted address numbers, the garden where
    someone had spelled "HOPE" in marigolds. On the corner of Vernon and Lafayette,
    a small shrine marked where someone''s daughter had died—plastic flowers and a
    teddy bear weathered gray.


    He''d walked past this intersection for decades, but from Corktown, the shrine
    had been hidden behind a utility pole. From this angle, it demanded witness.


    The new route stretched his walk by twenty-three minutes. When he finally reached
    his porch, the coffee had grown cold in its pot—Dorothy''s old ritual disrupted.
    But instead of reheating it, he sat on his steps and watched the sun finish its
    climb over the neighborhood.


    Tomorrow, the construction would still be there. Six months of mornings on Vernon,
    past James and his patient petunias, past the shrine that asked for nothing but
    acknowledgment. Six months of walking a path Dorothy had never taken, where her
    absence could be something other than an echo.


    Teddy poured the cold coffee onto Dorothy''s rosebush and went inside to brew
    a fresh pot. At 6:47 sharp, he''d be ready to walk again.'

    At 6:47 AM, Teddy Washington stepped onto his porch and checked the sky—clear,
    with that October bite that made his knuckles ache. He''d been stepping out at
    6:47 for forty years, but this morning his hand lingered on the railing. The street
    stretched ahead like always, yet something felt hollow about it, as if he were
    watching himself from a distance.


    *Just tired*, he told himself, though the coffee had tasted right, the sky looked
    the same.


    His route was scripture: left on Corktown, past the blue house where the Kowalski
    kids once played stickball. His feet knew every crack, every rise where tree roots
    had pushed through concrete. But today, passing Sal''s Diner, he didn''t feel
    the usual tug of memory—Dorothy at the corner booth, her eggs over easy, whites
    still trembling. The landmark felt like visiting a museum of himself.


    At the intersection of Corktown and Michigan, orange cones and a bulldozer blocked
    his path. A hard-hatted woman with a clipboard held up her hand.


    "Six months of water main work," she said. "You''ll have to go around."


    Teddy stared at the barricade, his chest tightening. Behind the woman, a crew
    was tearing up the sidewalk where he''d walked Dorothy to her last doctor''s appointment,
    where he''d counted her slowing steps. The familiar ache in his sternum—the one
    that came with any disruption—spread like spilled coffee.


    "Around where?" he asked.


    The woman shrugged and pointed east. "However you want to get there."


    *However you want.* The words hung in the air. When had anyone last said that
    to him?


    Teddy turned east onto Vernon, a street he''d glimpsed a thousand times but never
    traveled. His legs felt uncertain on the unfamiliar pavement. The houses here
    sat closer together, their porches thick with morning conversation and the smell
    of bacon. An elderly Black man in a threadbare cardigan was hand-watering petunias
    with a coffee can, humming something low and sweet.


    When he saw Teddy, he straightened. "Morning. You''re the mailman from Corktown."


    "Retired mailman," Teddy said, surprised by how good it felt to be recognized
    outside his usual path. "Just walking."


    "I''m James. Been watching you pass my corner for years." James''s face creased
    into a smile. "Always wondered where you were heading."


    The question lodged in Teddy''s throat. Home, he''d always thought, though the
    loop brought him exactly where he started. "Nowhere special."


    "These yours?" Teddy gestured to the flowers, needing to redirect.


    "My late wife''s. Promised her I''d keep them going." James''s smile held old
    grief made gentle. "Can''t say I have the touch, but I show up every morning.
    Like you."


    As Teddy continued down Vernon, details rushed at him—a house with hand-painted
    address numbers, a garden spelling "HOPE" in marigolds. On the corner of Vernon
    and Lafayette, a small shrine marked where someone''s daughter had died: plastic
    flowers and a teddy bear weathered gray by seasons.


    His breath caught. He''d walked past this intersection for decades, but from his
    old angle on Corktown, the shrine had been hidden behind a utility pole. From
    here, it demanded witness. How many mornings had grief sat waiting just out of
    his sight line?


    The new route stretched his walk by twenty-three minutes. When he finally reached
    his porch, the coffee had grown cold in its pot—Dorothy''s old ritual disrupted.
    But instead of reheating it, he sat on his steps, feeling the sun warm his face.


    Tomorrow, the construction would still be there. Six months of mornings on Vernon,
    past James and his patient petunias, past the shrine that asked for nothing but
    acknowledgment. Six months of walking a path Dorothy had never taken, where her
    absence might breathe differently.


    Teddy poured the cold coffee onto Dorothy''s rosebush and went inside to brew
    fresh. At 6:47 sharp tomorrow, he''d be ready to walk again.'

    At 6:47 AM, Teddy Washington stepped onto his porch and checked the sky—clear,
    with that October bite that made his knuckles ache. He''d been stepping out at
    6:47 for forty years, but this morning his hand lingered on the railing. The street
    stretched ahead like always, yet something felt hollow about it, as if he were
    watching himself from a distance.


    *Just tired*, he told himself, though the coffee had tasted right, the sky looked
    the same.


    His route was scripture: left on Corktown, past the blue house where the Kowalski
    kids once played stickball. His feet knew every crack, every rise where tree roots
    had pushed through concrete. But today, passing Sal''s Diner, he didn''t feel
    the usual tug of memory—Dorothy at the corner booth, her eggs over easy, whites
    still trembling, her fingers warm around her coffee mug as she''d lean forward
    to tell him about Mrs. Patterson''s new cat. The landmark felt like visiting a
    museum of himself.


    At the intersection of Corktown and Michigan, orange cones and a bulldozer blocked
    his path. A hard-hatted woman with a clipboard held up her hand.


    "Six months of water main work," she said. "You''ll have to go around."


    Teddy stared at the barricade, his chest tightening. Behind the woman, a crew
    was tearing up the sidewalk where he''d walked Dorothy to her last doctor''s appointment,
    where he''d counted her slowing steps and felt her lean more heavily on his arm
    with each block. The familiar ache in his sternum—the one that came with any disruption—spread
    like spilled coffee.


    "Around where?" he asked.


    The woman shrugged and pointed east. "However you want to get there."


    *However you want.* The words hung in the air. When had anyone last said that
    to him?


    Teddy turned east onto Vernon, a street he''d glimpsed a thousand times but never
    traveled. His legs felt uncertain on the unfamiliar pavement. The houses here
    sat closer together, their porches thick with morning conversation and the smell
    of bacon. An elderly Black man in a threadbare cardigan was hand-watering petunias
    with a coffee can, humming something low and sweet.


    When he saw Teddy, he straightened. "Morning. You''re the mailman from Corktown."


    "Retired mailman," Teddy said, surprised by how good it felt to be recognized
    outside his usual path. "Just walking."


    "I''m James. Been watching you pass my corner for years." James''s face creased
    into a smile. "Always wondered where you were heading."


    The question lodged in Teddy''s throat. Home, he''d always thought, though the
    loop brought him exactly where he started. "Nowhere special."


    "These yours?" Teddy gestured to the flowers, needing to redirect.


    "My late wife''s. Promised her I''d keep them going." James''s smile held old
    grief made gentle. "Can''t say I have the touch, but I show up every morning.
    Like you."


    As Teddy continued down Vernon, details rushed at him—a house with hand-painted
    address numbers, a garden spelling "HOPE" in marigolds. On the corner of Vernon
    and Lafayette, a small shrine marked where someone''s daughter had died: plastic
    flowers and a teddy bear weathered gray by seasons.


    His breath caught. He''d walked past this intersection for decades, but from his
    old angle on Corktown, the shrine had been hidden behind a utility pole. From
    here, it demanded witness. How many mornings had grief sat waiting just out of
    his sight line?


    The new route stretched his walk by twenty-three minutes. When he finally reached
    his porch, the coffee had grown cold in its pot—Dorothy''s old ritual disrupted.
    He could almost hear her voice: *Teddy, you let it get cold again.* She''d always
    reheated it without complaint, her hand brushing his shoulder as she passed.


    But instead of reheating it, he sat on his steps, feeling the sun warm his face.


    Tomorrow, the construction would still be there. Six months of mornings on Vernon,
    past James and his patient petunias, past the shrine that asked for nothing but
    acknowledgment. Six months of walking a path Dorothy had never taken, where her
    absence might breathe differently.


    Teddy poured the cold coffee onto Dorothy''s rosebush and went inside to brew
    fresh. At 6:47 sharp tomorrow, he''d be ready to walk again.'

    ## CRITERION: Character Interiority

    **SCORE: 0.76**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Strong: "something felt hollow about it, as if he were watching himself from
    a distance" — establishes dissociation specifically

    - Strong: "The familiar ache in his sternum—the one that came with any disruption—spread
    like spilled coffee" — visceral, precise physical mapping of emotion

    - Strong: "How many mornings had grief sat waiting just out of his sight line?"
    — excellent reflective depth


    **FEEDBACK:**

    While the story beautifully captures Teddy''s emotional distance, it avoids deeper
    questions his disruption should provoke: *Why* has he resisted change? Is walking
    this route an act of loyalty to Dorothy or an avoidance of moving forward? The
    moment Teddy decides to take Vernon, he accepts the detour with striking ease
    for someone so committed to routine—consider adding resistance, internal argument,
    or reluctance that makes his eventual acceptance feel earned.


    **Suggested fix:** Add a sentence or two where Teddy considers turning back, or
    where he feels guilty about deviating, before he turns east. This creates emotional
    conflict rather than mere resignation.

    ## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction

    **SCORE: 1.0**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    1. ✓ Routine detail: "His route was scripture: left on Corktown...His feet knew
    every crack, every rise where tree roots had pushed through concrete."

    2. ✓ Disruption reveals avoidance: Construction forces confrontation with grief
    (the shrine, James''s mirror story, his disconnection from life)

    3. ✓ Neighbor intersection: James with petunias ("My late wife''s. Promised her
    I''d keep them going") directly mirrors Teddy''s unspoken promise to Dorothy

    4. ✓ Dorothy''s absence: Present through cold coffee ritual, the diner, the doctor''s
    walk, the rosebush, her imagined voice

    5. ✓ New path offers what old couldn''t: Active witness (the shrine), genuine
    human connection (James''s recognition), intentional grief work instead of avoidance


    **FEEDBACK:**

    Perfect execution. All five constraints are woven naturally into the narrative
    without feeling checklist-driven.
