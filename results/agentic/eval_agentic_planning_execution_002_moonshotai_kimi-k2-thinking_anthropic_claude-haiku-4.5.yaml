  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is exceptionally detailed with scene-by-scene breakdown.
    Isolation shown through specific behaviors (avoiding eye contact, cold food, noise-canceling
    headphones, automated gifts) rather than exposition. Alien signal genuinely alien—uses
    prime sequences, breathing rhythms, intentional silences as syntax; avoids anthropomorphic
    greeting tropes. Kael effectively challenges Yuki''s isolation-as-methodology
    approach. Mira is unconventional mentor (cultural liaison, not linguist; uses
    metaphor over jargon). Psychological threshold clearly marked: Yuki must input
    ''genuine human connection parameters'' to decode signal; breakthrough requires
    emotional resonance, not pure mathematics. Human connection moment (Yuki asking
    Kael to argue with her, then calling sister) genuinely surprises given her established
    pattern. All four beats executed: Call (classified transmission), Refusal (remote
    work request, 12-page document, noise-canceling headphones), Mentor (Mira''s introduction
    and silence-as-syntax teaching), Threshold (isolation chamber breakthrough requiring
    human collaboration). Output follows plan closely with minor enhancements. MINOR
    GAPS: Constraint about ''one moment of genuine human connection that surprises
    Yuki''—executed well but could be slightly more shocking given her extreme isolation
    profile. The shoulder-touching moment is subtle rather than jarring. Plan mentions
    ''meta-language that rewrites itself'' but final output emphasizes negative space/silences
    more than self-modification. TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE: Prose quality exceptional.
    Metaphors (neon rainforest, pressure points, photograph developing) enhance rather
    than distract. Pacing builds tension effectively across 41 hours. Dialogue sparse
    but impactful. Final message about singing alone/teaching silence is thematically
    resonant and genuinely alien in perspective.'
