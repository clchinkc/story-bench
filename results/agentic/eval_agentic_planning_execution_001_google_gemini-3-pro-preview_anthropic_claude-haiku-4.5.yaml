  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with clear beat-by-beat breakdown. Output
    demonstrates strong atmospheric writing and tension. Successfully executes: (1)
    False lead (Julian Vane/crime of passion theory), (2) Unconventional technique
    (Metronome Method with sensory deprivation), (3) Ticking clock (6:00 PM deadline,
    30-minute countdown), (4) Secondary betrayal (Kincaid trades location for immunity),
    (5) Midpoint confrontation (hacked video call with killer). Past failure explicitly
    confronted (Elena''s final words recited). WEAKNESSES: Missing ''Debate'' beat—no
    clear scene where Marcus argues his theory with another character before pursuing
    it. The Vane theory is abandoned too quickly without a proper debate/resistance
    scene. ''Break into Two'' beat is unclear—the transition from false lead to true
    revelation happens via the video call but lacks a distinct structural moment.
    Opening Image establishes status quo effectively but could be more cinematic.
    The FBI arrival at the end is strong but leaves narrative momentum unresolved.
    TECHNICAL: Excellent pacing in final act. Dialogue is sharp and menacing. The
    metronome technique is genuinely creative and well-integrated. The Elena callback
    is emotionally devastating and earned. Kincaid''s betrayal feels organic to character
    motivation (pension threat). The 30-minute countdown creates genuine urgency.'
