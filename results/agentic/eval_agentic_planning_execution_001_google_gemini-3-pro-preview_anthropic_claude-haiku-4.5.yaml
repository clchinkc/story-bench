  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive and detailed with clear beat-by-beat
    structure. All 4 required beats (Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint) are
    explicitly mapped and executed in output. Five of six constraints are fully satisfied:
    (1) False lead—warehouse decoy is clear and effective; (2) Unconventional profiling—''Auditory
    Empathy'' breathing sync technique is creative and specific; (3) Ticking clock—midnight
    deadline with 4-hour window established; (4) Secondary betrayal—Sarah''s tip-off
    to Vance is emotionally impactful; (5) Direct confrontation at Midpoint—phone
    call from killer confronts Marcus about Elena''s death. Execution follows plan
    closely with strong noir atmosphere, pacing acceleration, and character voice.
    Dialogue is natural and tension builds effectively. WEAKNESSES: (1) Past failure
    constraint—while the killer mentions Elena''s death, Marcus has NOT yet explicitly
    confronted his own hesitation/failure out loud in the execution (plan states he
    will ''admit out loud that he hesitated''—this occurs in plan but not yet in output,
    which cuts off mid-scene). Output is incomplete, ending mid-sentence during Marcus''s
    response to Sarah. (2) Narrative cuts off before full Midpoint resolution, preventing
    full evaluation of how past failure confrontation plays out. TECHNICAL: Plan is
    well-structured with clear constraint checkpoints. Output demonstrates strong
    writing quality with atmospheric detail, character dynamics, and procedural authenticity.
    The incomplete nature of output (truncated mid-dialogue) prevents full assessment
    of constraint satisfaction, though trajectory is clear.'
