  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with detailed behavioral specifics (meal
    packs, rigid posture, AI conversations, mother''s hologram rejection). All 4 required
    beats present and well-executed: Call (UN summons), Refusal (draft rejection),
    Mentor (Zhao with penguin, unconventional wisdom), Threshold (emotional breakthrough
    with Voss). Isolation shown through action (avoiding eye contact, monosyllabic
    responses, rigid posture) rather than exposition. Genuine human connection moment
    (Voss''s thermos + ''you''re allowed to be tired'') genuinely surprises Yuki and
    reader. Signal feels alien (non-repetitive, adaptive, mirroring trauma patterns
    rather than anthropomorphic greeting). Voss effectively challenges Yuki''s approach
    (emotional vs. functional interpretation). WEAKNESSES: Alien signal constraint
    partially undercut—while non-anthropomorphic, the ''screaming/dying'' interpretation
    and final ''lullaby'' lean slightly toward emotional anthropomorphism despite
    framing as functional. Plan mentions 6 months but execution spans unclear timeframe.
    Psychological threshold execution is strong but could be more explicitly marked
    as the turning point. Minor: Zhao''s unconventional nature (penguin, cryptic wisdom)
    works but feels slightly underdeveloped compared to plan''s promise. Output slightly
    compresses plan''s middle section, losing some tension-building. EXECUTION FIDELITY:
    Output follows plan''s structure faithfully but condenses Act 2 considerably,
    reducing the gradual isolation-to-connection arc''s pacing. The signal''s nature
    shifts subtly between plan (non-human semantic fields) and output (trauma mirroring),
    creating minor thematic drift.'
