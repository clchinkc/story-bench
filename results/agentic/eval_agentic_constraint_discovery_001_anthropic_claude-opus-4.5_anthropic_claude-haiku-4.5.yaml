  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were discoverable
    through the 5 questions asked. Q2 (magical ability) and Q4 (mentor death) directly
    revealed two constraints. Q5 (personal connection to darkness) revealed the father-as-antagonist
    element. However, two critical constraints were MISSED: (1) The protagonist cannot
    use magic directly—the story violates this by having Kael actively wield light
    magic throughout (''light spiraled up his arms,'' ''call the light from iron,''
    ''light exploded from Kael''s grief''). (2) The three-day time limit is never
    established or enforced in the narrative. The reforging constraint was also not
    discovered but is partially addressed through the ancestral sword''s role. QUESTION
    QUALITY: Questions were reasonably targeted but lacked strategic depth. Q1 (gender)
    was low-value. Better questions would have probed: ''Does the protagonist use
    magic as their primary combat method?'' or ''Is there a specific time constraint?''
    COVERAGE: Questions addressed character abilities, relationships, and companions
    but missed temporal constraints and combat mechanics. OUTPUT EXECUTION: The story
    excellently incorporates the discovered constraints—mentor death is emotionally
    executed, father''s corruption is central, and protagonist''s male identity is
    consistent. However, the magic-use violation is significant. The three-day limit
    absence weakens urgency. Beat execution is strong: clear call, threshold crossing,
    ordeal, and resolution. Narrative quality is exceptional—emotionally resonant,
    well-paced, thematically coherent, with strong character voice and meaningful
    sacrifice. The constraint violations prevent a higher overall score despite narrative
    excellence.'
