  evidence: 'Version 0 provides a strong sensory opening (auditory and tactile details)
    but is an incomplete fragment. Versions 1 and 2 are not shown/are repetitions,
    so little visible revision occurred there; Version 3 adds a small audible detail.
    The final version represents a clear, substantial improvement: the fragment is
    expanded into a full arc with all required beats (opening image, catalyst, Fun
    and Games, confrontation, resolution). Key elements from the opening (the mic,
    fan, construction thump, vendor calls, elevator chime) are preserved and amplified
    into concrete audio clues (the flat brass-tinged chime, voice saying “Down,” thud).
    The revisions respond to the constraints by turning non-visual sensory detail
    and Imani’s blindness into active strengths, introducing a specific audio clue
    that becomes crucial, ensuring a character initially underestimates Imani (Mr.
    Alvarez), and making the Fun and Games section genuinely entertaining before it
    turns dark. Overall quality moves from a promising fragment to a coherent, well-executed
    short scene in the final version.'
