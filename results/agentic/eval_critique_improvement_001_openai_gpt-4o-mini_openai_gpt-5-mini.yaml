  evidence: Across revisions the piece became more concrete and attentive to the critique
    points. V0 opened with a moody setup but relied more on exposition. V1 introduced
    more active details (notepad, observing locals) to show Sarah's methodical approach.
    V2 tightened sensory detail and started to make the fog obstructive rather than
    merely atmospheric. V3 and the final text added the diesel/rot scent, the fisherman's
    vanishing in the mist, and the bartender's evasiveness, addressing the requirement
    for a local secret and giving the fog a narrative role (obscuring suspects and
    evidence). The past case is introduced in the final draft—there is a hint and
    then an immediate recognition—so foreshadowing was attempted but is somewhat cramped
    (hint and reveal occur nearly back-to-back). The ending was adjusted to stop at
    a decision point rather than resolve the investigation. Overall strengths (methodical
    actions, fog as obstacle, local secrecy, decision ending) were preserved and strengthened;
    the one remaining weakness is that the past-case foreshadowing could appear earlier
    or be more subtly seeded before the reveal.
