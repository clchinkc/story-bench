  evidence: Questions revealed two relevant facts (mentor death; darkness has personal
    connection). The story incorporates the personal connection (father = Shadow King)
    and includes a mentor's death, but the mentor dies before the Ordeal rather than
    during it (violates timing). The hidden prohibition on the protagonist using magic
    was violated—Kael discovers and uses light magic directly. The three-day time
    limit is not enforced as a hard deadline (only a travel-distance mention). The
    requirement to reforge a broken ancestral sword is absent—the sword is given already
    forged. Father-as-failed-hero is implied (Kael believed his father died a hero
    and the father became darkness), so that beat is partially present.
