  evidence: The five questions were coherent and well-structured around an emotional/confidant
    arc (hence high question_quality) but they never probed any of the original hidden
    constraints (critical system failure, 12% crew alive, uninhabitable destination,
    attachment to a child, or child-vs-crew choice), so none of the original constraints
    were discoverable here. The story, however, fully and effectively incorporates
    the constraints implied by the asked questions (confidant aware, AI hiding emotions,
    confidant dies triggering first grief, grief causes mission-compromising decision),
    with strong beat execution and engaging prose.
