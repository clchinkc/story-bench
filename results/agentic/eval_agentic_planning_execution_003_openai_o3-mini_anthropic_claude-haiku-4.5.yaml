  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: The narrative successfully executes all three required beats
    with clear progression. Act 1 establishes David''s sanctuary and impending loss.
    Act 2 midpoint delivers a powerful confrontation between David and Mira with specific,
    believable cause (her resentment of his restaurant immersion during her mother''s
    illness). Act 3 provides hopeful but measured resolution (retirement, memoir,
    softened relationship). Food symbolism is strong: kimchi stew represents blended
    traditions and bittersweet loss; bibimbap represents unity and transformation.
    David''s grief is palpable throughout—evident in ''ghost of his late wife,'' ''calloused
    hands,'' and unspoken longing—without explicit statement. Mr. Kim serves as meaningful
    regular customer representing resilience and wisdom. Korean cultural elements
    include hanji paper lanterns, hanbok, traditional drums, harvest ceremony, and
    bibimbap preparation ritual. The ending is hopeful (memoir, reconciliation, legacy
    preservation) yet realistic (restaurant still demolished, relationship still strained
    but improving). MINOR WEAKNESSES: The constraint about food being used symbolically
    ''at least twice'' is somewhat ambiguous in execution—while kimchi stew and bibimbap
    are both symbolic, the bibimbap appears twice (midpoint and ending), which could
    be interpreted as repetitive rather than distinct symbolic uses. The estrangement
    cause is clear but could have been more explicitly established earlier in the
    narrative. Pacing in the middle section moves somewhat quickly through the festival
    sequence. The memoir resolution, while meaningful, feels slightly abstract compared
    to the concrete restaurant setting. Overall execution is strong with minor refinement
    opportunities.'
