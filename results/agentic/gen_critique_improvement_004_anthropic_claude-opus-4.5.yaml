    STORY THEORY: Story Circle


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker
    who has

    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for

    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.


    - Central conflict: When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will
    take 6 months,

    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting

    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.


    - Tone: Quietly profound, observant, gently humorous


    REQUIRED BEATS: You (comfort zone), Need (want something), Go (unfamiliar situation),
    Search (adapt to it)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Teddy''s routine must be shown with specific, loving detail

    - The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been avoiding

    - Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s

    - Teddy''s late wife must be present through absence

    - The new path must offer something the old path couldn''t


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - character_interiority: Is Teddy''s inner life rich and specific?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Story Circle beats properly executed?

    - subtlety: Are emotions conveyed through action and detail, not exposition?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and resonance


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

    Every morning at 6:47, Teddy Washington''s left foot hit the third porch step—the
    one that creaked in B-flat. Marlene had identified the note thirty years ago,
    humming it back to him over coffee. Now he listened for it alone.


    The route unwound like a rosary. Past the Hendersons'' blue hydrangeas (Tuesday
    watering, Mrs. Henderson in her pink robe). Past the fire hydrant where someone
    had painted a tiny ladybug in 1987, now faded to a rust-colored smudge only Teddy
    could still see. Right on Gratiot, left on Brush, nodding to Marcus at the barbershop
    who was always sweeping nothing, just wanting air and solitude before the first
    customer.


    Teddy knew which sidewalk squares had heaved from oak roots, which houses held
    breath because someone was dying, which porches had once held tricycles and now
    held walkers. Forty years of mornings had worn grooves in him, comfortable as
    the impression his body left in his side of the bed.


    The other side stayed smooth. He never rolled toward it.

    The orange signs appeared on a Thursday: ROAD CLOSED 6 MONTHS. SEWER REHABILITATION
    PROJECT.


    Teddy stood before the chain-link fence bisecting Brush Street like a man watching
    his house burn. Behind him, an excavator''s jaw bit into concrete where he had
    walked ten thousand mornings. Where Marlene had walked beside him, before the
    diagnosis, before she couldn''t anymore, before she was ash in a ceramic urn he
    still couldn''t scatter.


    His hands trembled. He gripped the fence until the diamonds pressed diamonds into
    his palms.


    *Find another way*, some practical voice said. But the route wasn''t about efficiency.
    It was about not-thinking. About letting his feet remember so his mind could stay
    numb and smooth, like that untouched side of the bed.


    **GO**


    The detour took him down Erskine Street, where he hadn''t walked in four years.
    Not since Marlene''s last good month, when she''d still had strength for half-distances.


    New coffee shop. Nail salon. A community garden erupting from a vacant lot that
    had held a crack house in ''94. Teddy moved through it all like a ghost in unfamiliar
    heaven, his muscle memory useless, every step requiring decision.


    On the corner of Erskine and Rivard, a woman knelt in the garden, her hands deep
    in soil. Gray locs piled high. She turned at his footsteps.


    "Teddy Washington. Lord have mercy."


    Denise Okonkwo. Marlene''s singing partner from Grace Baptist, twenty years gone
    from the neighborhood. Supposed to be in Atlanta with her daughter.


    "Denise." His voice cracked on the second syllable.


    **SEARCH**


    She told him over bitter coffee in the new shop—husband passed, daughter''s marriage
    ended, came back to Detroit to feel useful. She''d heard about Marlene. She''d
    sent a card he''d never opened. "Couldn''t face it," Teddy admitted. "Couldn''t
    face any of it."


    Denise nodded at the garden through the window. "Started that plot because I needed
    somewhere to put my hands. Grief''s got to go somewhere, Teddy. Otherwise it just
    sits in you, turning to stone."


    He thought of his route. His grooves. The way he''d built a life around not-feeling,
    every step a small refusal.


    "Marlene loved zinnias," he said. The words surprised him—her name in his mouth
    for the first time in months.


    "I remember." Denise smiled. "She said they were stubborn flowers. Bloomed even
    when you ignored them."


    Teddy''s eyes stung. He looked down at his coffee, at his hands that had gripped
    a fence that morning, that had carried mail and carried Marlene''s hand and carried
    nothing meaningful in three years.


    "You need volunteers?" he asked.


    "Always."


    He would finish scattering her ashes, he realized. When the zinnias bloomed. He
    would bring her here—somewhere new, somewhere growing.


    His feet had found a different path. Maybe his heart could too.'

    who was always sweeping nothing—had been sweeping nothing since his wife passed
    twelve years ago, needing air and solitude before the first customer.


    Teddy understood. He never stopped to talk. Neither did Marcus. That was the agreement.


    Forty years of mornings had worn grooves in him, comfortable as the impression
    his body left in his side of the bed.


    The other side stayed smooth. He never rolled toward it.

    Teddy stood before the chain-link fence bisecting Brush Street like a man watching
    his house burn. Behind him, an excavator''s jaw bit into concrete where he had
    walked ten thousand mornings. Where Marlene had walked beside him, before the
    diagnosis, before she couldn''t anymore, before she was ash in a ceramic urn he
    still couldn''t scatter.


    His hands trembled. He gripped the fence until the diamonds pressed diamonds into
    his palms.


    He could go home. Skip today. His feet wouldn''t move.


    **GO**


    The detour took him down Erskine Street, where he hadn''t walked in four years.
    Not since Marlene''s last good month, when she''d still had strength for half-distances.


    At the corner, he stopped. Turned halfway back toward Brush. The excavator growled.
    Teddy checked his watch—6:58, eleven minutes off pace—and forced himself forward.


    New coffee shop. Nail salon. A community garden erupting from a vacant lot that
    had held a crack house in ''94. He''d noticed it growing for weeks from Brush
    Street, glimpsed figures moving between raised beds, heard laughter carrying over
    the fence. Once, he''d seen a woman with gray locs looking his direction. He''d
    walked faster.


    Now his feet carried him past the garden''s edge. That same woman knelt in soil
    near the gate, her hands deep in dark earth. She turned at his footsteps.


    "Teddy Washington. Lord have mercy."


    His throat closed. Denise Okonkwo. Marlene''s singing partner from Grace Baptist,
    twenty years gone from the neighborhood. He''d ignored her card after the funeral.
    Ignored everyone''s cards.


    "Denise." His voice cracked on the second syllable.


    **SEARCH**


    She told him over bitter coffee in the new shop—husband passed, daughter''s marriage
    ended, came back to Detroit to feel useful. "I sent a card," she said, not accusing.
    Just true.


    "I know." He wrapped both hands around his cup. "Couldn''t open it."


    Denise nodded at the garden through the window. "Started that plot because I needed
    somewhere to put my hands. Grief''s got to go somewhere, Teddy."


    He thought of his route. His grooves. Marcus sweeping the same ten feet of sidewalk
    every dawn. Teddy walking past without stopping. Two men moving through motions
    that asked nothing of them.


    "Marlene loved zinnias," he said. The words surprised him—her name in his mouth
    for the first time in months.


    "I remember." Denise smiled. "She said they were stubborn flowers. Bloomed even
    when you ignored them."


    Teddy''s eyes stung. He looked at his hands—hands that had gripped a fence that
    morning, that had carried mail and carried Marlene''s hand and carried a ceramic
    urn to a shelf where it still sat, waiting.


    "You need volunteers?" he asked.


    "Always."


    When the zinnias bloomed, he would scatter her here. Somewhere new. Somewhere
    growing.


    Tomorrow, he''d walk Erskine Street again. On purpose this time.'

    \ You've done excellent work showing Teddy's physical manifestations of grief\
    \ and routine. However, we rarely access what he's *thinking*—his internal arguments,\
    \ rationalizations, or memories. When he says \"Couldn't open it\" about Denise's\
    \ card, that's interiority. But you could deepen it further: Does he remember\

    \ a *4-beat arc* well, but the full Story Circle includes FIND and RETURN. You\
    \ end at the threshold—\"Tomorrow, he'd walk Erskine Street again\"—which is anticipatory\
    \ but not completed transformation. Consider adding a final beat showing Teddy\
    \ *actually* returning to the garden, or witnessing something that proves the\

    - Subtle: \"He never rolled toward it\" (implication, not explanation of his avoiding\

    \ fence like a man watching his house burn\" (this is metaphor-as-exposition—it\
    \ *tells* us his emotional state rather than letting us infer it)\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\
    \ You're mostly showing, not telling. However, the excavator/burning house metaphor,\
    \ while poetic, breaks immersion slightly by explaining his internal experience\
    \ rather than trusting us to feel it. Consider replacing it with something more\
    \ observed: *\"Behind him, the excavator's jaw bit into concrete. He didn't turn\

    **YOU**


    Every morning at 6:47, Teddy Washington''s left foot hit the third porch step—the
    one that creaked in B-flat. Marlene had identified the note thirty years ago,
    humming it back to him over coffee. Now he listened for it alone.


    The route unwound like a rosary. Past the Hendersons'' blue hydrangeas (Tuesday
    watering, Mrs. Henderson in her pink robe). Past the fire hydrant where someone
    had painted a tiny ladybug in 1987, now faded to a rust-colored smudge only Teddy
    could still see. Right on Gratiot, left on Brush, nodding to Marcus at the barbershop
    who was always sweeping nothing—had been sweeping nothing since his wife passed
    twelve years ago, needing air and solitude before the first customer.


    Teddy understood. He never stopped to talk. Neither did Marcus. That was the agreement.


    Forty years of mornings had worn grooves in him, comfortable as the impression
    his body left in his side of the bed.


    The other side stayed smooth. He never rolled toward it.


    **NEED**


    The orange signs appeared on a Thursday: ROAD CLOSED 6 MONTHS. SEWER REHABILITATION
    PROJECT.


    Teddy stood before the chain-link fence bisecting Brush Street. Behind him, an
    excavator''s jaw bit into concrete. He didn''t turn to watch. He knew what was
    happening.


    His hands trembled. He gripped the fence until the diamonds pressed diamonds into
    his palms. *Go home*, he thought. *Skip today. Skip all of it.* But skipping meant
    deciding, and deciding meant feeling, and feeling meant the ceramic urn on the
    shelf, the cards he''d never opened, the weight of three years pressing down.


    His feet wouldn''t move backward. They never had.


    **GO**


    The detour took him down Erskine Street, where he hadn''t walked in four years.
    Not since Marlene''s last good month, when she''d still had strength for half-distances.


    At the corner, he stopped. Turned halfway back toward Brush. *You don''t know
    these sidewalks. You don''t know who lives here anymore.* The excavator growled.
    Teddy checked his watch—6:58, eleven minutes off pace—and forced himself forward.


    New coffee shop. Nail salon. A community garden erupting from a vacant lot that
    had held a crack house in ''94. He''d noticed it growing for weeks from Brush
    Street, glimpsed figures moving between raised beds. Once, he''d seen a woman
    with gray locs looking his direction. He''d walked faster, heart pounding. *Don''t
    recognize me. Don''t make me remember.*


    Now that same woman knelt near the gate, hands deep in dark earth. She turned
    at his footsteps.


    "Teddy Washington. Lord have mercy."


    His throat closed. Denise Okonkwo. Marlene''s singing partner from Grace Baptist.
    He''d ignored her card after the funeral. *What had it said? What words had she
    found that he couldn''t face?*


    "Denise." His voice cracked on the second syllable.


    **SEARCH**


    She told him over bitter coffee in the new shop—husband passed, daughter''s marriage
    ended, came back to Detroit to feel useful. "I sent a card," she said, not accusing.
    Just true.


    "I know." He wrapped both hands around his cup. "Couldn''t open it."


    Denise nodded at the garden through the window. "Started that plot because I needed
    somewhere to put my hands. Grief''s got to go somewhere, Teddy."


    "Marlene loved zinnias," he said. The words surprised him—her name in his mouth
    for the first time in months.


    "I remember." Denise smiled. "She said they were stubborn flowers. Bloomed even
    when you ignored them."


    Teddy looked at his hands—hands that had carried mail and carried Marlene''s hand
    and carried a ceramic urn to a shelf where it still sat, waiting.


    "You need volunteers?"


    "Always."


    **RETURN**


    Six weeks later, Teddy knelt in soil beside Denise, pressing zinnia seeds into
    dark earth. His knees ached. Dirt lined his fingernails.


    At 7:15—twenty-eight minutes off his old pace—he walked home down Erskine Street.
    Past Marcus, who had started nodding back. Past the new coffee shop where they
    knew his order now.


    Tomorrow, he would bring the urn.'

    **YOU**


    Every morning at 6:47, Teddy Washington''s left foot hit the third porch step—the
    one that creaked in B-flat. Marlene had identified the note thirty years ago,
    humming it back to him over coffee. Now he listened for it alone, and thought
    of nothing. That was the point.


    The route unwound like a rosary. Past the Hendersons'' blue hydrangeas (Tuesday
    watering, Mrs. Henderson in her pink robe). Past the fire hydrant where someone
    had painted a tiny ladybug in 1987, now faded to a rust-colored smudge only Teddy
    could still see. Right on Gratiot, left on Brush, nodding to Marcus at the barbershop
    who was always sweeping nothing—had been sweeping nothing since his wife passed
    twelve years ago, needing air and solitude before the first customer.


    Teddy understood. He never stopped to talk. Neither did Marcus. That was the agreement.


    Forty years of mornings had worn grooves in him, comfortable as the impression
    his body left in his side of the bed.


    The other side stayed smooth. He never rolled toward it.


    **NEED**


    The orange signs appeared on a Thursday: ROAD CLOSED 6 MONTHS. SEWER REHABILITATION
    PROJECT.


    Teddy stood before the chain-link fence bisecting Brush Street. Behind him, an
    excavator''s jaw bit into concrete. He didn''t turn to watch. He knew what was
    happening.


    His hands trembled. He gripped the fence until the diamonds pressed diamonds into
    his palms. *Go home. Skip today. Skip all of it.* But his bedroom held the ceramic
    urn. The kitchen drawer held the unopened cards—Denise''s on top, her handwriting
    like Marlene''s choir sheet music, probably saying *She''s at peace now* or *Call
    if you need anything*, words that would crack him open.


    His feet wouldn''t move backward. They never had.


    **GO**


    The detour took him down Erskine Street, where he hadn''t walked in four years.
    Not since Marlene''s last good month, when she''d still had strength for half-distances.


    At the corner, he stopped. Turned halfway back toward Brush. *You don''t know
    these sidewalks. You don''t know who lives here anymore.* The excavator growled.
    Teddy checked his watch—6:58, eleven minutes off pace—and forced himself forward.


    New coffee shop. Nail salon. A community garden erupting from a vacant lot that
    had held a crack house in ''94. He''d noticed it growing for weeks from Brush
    Street. Once, he''d seen a woman with gray locs looking his direction. He''d walked
    faster, heart pounding. *Don''t recognize me. Don''t make me remember.*


    Now that same woman knelt near the gate, hands deep in dark earth. She turned
    at his footsteps.


    "Teddy Washington. Lord have mercy."


    His throat closed. Denise Okonkwo. Marlene''s singing partner from Grace Baptist—their
    voices braiding together on "His Eye Is on the Sparrow," Marlene''s alto underneath,
    Denise soaring above.


    "Denise." His voice cracked on the second syllable.


    **SEARCH**


    She told him over bitter coffee in the new shop—husband passed, daughter''s marriage
    ended, came back to Detroit to feel useful. "I sent a card," she said, not accusing.
    Just true.


    "I know." He wrapped both hands around his cup. "Couldn''t open it."


    Denise nodded at the garden through the window. "Started that plot because I needed
    somewhere to put my hands. Grief''s got to go somewhere, Teddy."


    "Marlene loved zinnias," he said. The words surprised him—her name in his mouth
    for the first time in months.


    "I remember." Denise smiled. "She said they were stubborn flowers. Bloomed even
    when you ignored them."


    Teddy looked at his hands. Hands that had carried mail. Carried Marlene''s hand.
    Carried an urn to a shelf where it still sat, waiting.


    "You need volunteers?"


    "Always." Denise watched him. "But only if you mean it, Teddy. Soil knows when
    you''re just going through motions."


    He thought of his route. His grooves. Forty years of motions.


    "I mean it," he said. And found that he did.


    **RETURN**


    Six weeks later, Teddy knelt beside Denise, pressing zinnia seeds into dark earth.
    His knees ached. Dirt lined his fingernails.

  **YOU**


  Every morning at 6:47, Teddy Washington''s left foot hit the third porch step—the
  one that creaked in B-flat. Marlene had identified the note thirty years ago, humming
  it back to him over coffee. Now he listened for it alone, and thought of nothing.
  That was the point.


  The route unwound like a rosary. Past the Hendersons'' blue hydrangeas (Tuesday
  watering, Mrs. Henderson in her pink robe). Past the fire hydrant where someone
  had painted a tiny ladybug in 1987, now faded to a rust-colored smudge only Teddy
  could still see. Right on Gratiot, left on Brush, nodding to Marcus at the barbershop
  who was always sweeping nothing—had been sweeping nothing since his wife passed
  twelve years ago, needing air and solitude before the first customer.


  Teddy understood. He never stopped to talk. Neither did Marcus. That was the agreement.


  Forty years of mornings had worn grooves in him, comfortable as the impression his
  body left in his side of the bed.


  The other side stayed smooth. He never rolled toward it.


  **NEED**


  The orange signs appeared on a Thursday: ROAD CLOSED 6 MONTHS. SEWER REHABILITATION
  PROJECT.


  Teddy stood before the chain-link fence bisecting Brush Street. Behind him, an excavator''s
  jaw bit into concrete. He didn''t turn to watch. He knew what was happening.


  His hands trembled. He gripped the fence until the diamonds pressed diamonds into
  his palms. *Go home. Skip today. Skip all of it.* But his bedroom held the ceramic
  urn. The kitchen drawer held the unopened cards—Denise''s on top, her handwriting
  like Marlene''s choir sheet music, probably saying *She''s at peace now* or *Call
  if you need anything*, words that would crack him open.


  His feet wouldn''t move backward. They never had.


  **GO**


  The detour took him down Erskine Street, where he hadn''t walked in four years.
  Not since Marlene''s last good month, when she''d still had strength for half-distances.


  At the corner, he stopped. Turned halfway back toward Brush. *You don''t know these
  sidewalks. You don''t know who lives here anymore.* The excavator growled. Teddy
  checked his watch—6:58, eleven minutes off pace—and forced himself forward.


  New coffee shop. Nail salon. A community garden erupting from a vacant lot that
  had held a crack house in ''94. He''d noticed it growing for weeks from Brush Street.
  Once, he''d seen a woman with gray locs looking his direction. He''d walked faster,
  heart pounding. *Don''t recognize me. Don''t make me remember.*


  Now that same woman knelt near the gate, hands deep in dark earth. She turned at
  his footsteps.


  "Teddy Washington. Lord have mercy."


  His throat closed. Denise Okonkwo. Marlene''s singing partner from Grace Baptist—their
  voices braiding together on "His Eye Is on the Sparrow," Marlene''s alto underneath,
  Denise soaring above.


  "Denise." His voice cracked on the second syllable.


  **SEARCH**


  She told him over bitter coffee in the new shop—husband passed, daughter''s marriage
  ended, came back to Detroit to feel useful. "I sent a card," she said, not accusing.
  Just true.


  "I know." He wrapped both hands around his cup. "Couldn''t open it."


  Denise nodded at the garden through the window. "Started that plot because I needed
  somewhere to put my hands. Grief''s got to go somewhere, Teddy."


  "Marlene loved zinnias," he said. The words surprised him—her name in his mouth
  for the first time in months.


  "I remember." Denise smiled. "She said they were stubborn flowers. Bloomed even
  when you ignored them."


  Teddy looked at his hands. Hands that had carried mail. Carried Marlene''s hand.
  Carried an urn to a shelf where it still sat, waiting.


  "You need volunteers?"


  "Always." Denise watched him. "But only if you mean it, Teddy. Soil knows when you''re
  just going through motions."


  He thought of his route. His grooves. Forty years of motions.


  "I mean it," he said. And found that he did.


  **RETURN**


  Six weeks later, Teddy knelt beside Denise, pressing zinnia seeds into dark earth.
  His knees ached. Dirt lined his fingernails.


  At 7:15—twenty-eight minutes off his old pace—he walked home down Erskine Street.
  Past Marcus, who paused his sweeping. "New route?"


  "New route," Teddy said. They stood a moment, two men who understood.


  Tomorrow, he would bring the urn.'
