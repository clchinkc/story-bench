  evidence: The revisions show a clear improvement in detail and sensory language.
    Version 0 is a good start, but each subsequent version adds more specific, non-visual
    sensory details (e.g., 'plink-plink' of the drip, 'cumin-scented steam', 'faintly
    smelling of her coconut hair oil'). The audio clue becomes more specific and integrated,
    and the characterization of Imani and Wolfe develops well. The 'Fun and Games'
    aspect is present but could be slightly more pronounced before the turn. The initial
    underestimation of Imani is handled well by Wolfe's initial condescension.
