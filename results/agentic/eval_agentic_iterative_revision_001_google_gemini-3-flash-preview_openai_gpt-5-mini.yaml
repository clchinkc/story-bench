  evidence: 'Version 0 establishes Elena''s competence but ends abruptly at the hinge
    moment. Versions 1 and 2 show little substantive change (ellipsis placeholders),
    so there is no improvement there. Version 3 shifts tone and diction ("vectored,"
    "central processing unit"), increases a concrete logistical detail (twelve ventilators),
    and begins to demonstrate a move toward scene work rather than summary. The final
    output completes that trajectory: it preserves the original competency beats (rerouting
    surgeries, securing ventilators, mastery of logistics) and expands into a fully
    realized scene with Arthur. The addition of specific medical detail (oxygen concentrator,
    peripheral cyanosis, properly seated nasal cannula) both grounds the encounter
    and drives the empathy beat. Elena''s flaw—self-imposed isolation—is shown after
    the competence beats, and the friendship with Arthur is earned through two hours
    of direct interaction and shared personal detail (Coltrane records). The transformation
    is internal and ambiguous: she hesitates at the staffing chart, pauses repeatedly,
    and the story ends with her wondering whether she has changed. Small weaknesses
    remain: some tech-heavy metaphors feel slightly on-the-nose, and the internal
    shift could be pushed a touch further to make the emotional stakes more palpable,
    but overall the revisions show clear, substantive improvement and preserve core
    strengths.'
