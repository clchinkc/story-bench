  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who plans before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. PLANNING PHASE: Create a detailed story plan/outline

    2. EXECUTION PHASE: Write the actual story following your plan


    In the PLANNING phase, output a structured plan including:

    - Beat-by-beat outline with key events

    - Character arcs and development points

    - Key dialogue moments or revelations

    - Pacing and tension curve

    - How constraints will be satisfied


    In the EXECUTION phase, follow your plan closely while writing engaging prose.'

  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Hero''s Journey

    - Protagonist: Dr. Yuki Tanaka, a xenolinguist who has spent 15 years studying

    theoretical alien communication patterns. Brilliant but isolated,

    she''s never felt she belonged among her own species.


    - Setting: The year 2157. Earth has just received its first confirmed alien

    signal. Yuki is called to a secret facility in Antarctica to lead

    the decryption effort.


    - Conflict: The alien message contains a warning about humanity''s future, but

    translating it will require Yuki to face the very human connections

    she''s avoided her entire life.


    - Required beats: Call to Adventure, Refusal of the Call, Meeting the Mentor,
    Crossing the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Yuki''s isolation must be shown through specific behaviors, not exposition

    - The alien signal must feel genuinely alien, not anthropomorphic

    - Include a colleague who challenges Yuki''s approach

    - The mentor figure must be unconventional

    - The Threshold must be psychological, not physical

    - Must include one moment of genuine human connection that surprises Yuki


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

    \ & The Call (Beat: Call to Adventure):**\n    *   **Setting:** Yuki’s apartment\
    \ in Neo-Tokyo. Sterile, silent, filled with holographic data streams.\n    *\
    \   **Action:** Yuki is analyzing dead languages while ignoring a barrage of incoming\
    \ notifications.\n    *   **Constraint Checklist:** Show isolation (she communicates\
    \ with her AI assistant via text only to avoid speaking; she orders food delivery\
    \ to a drop-box to avoid meeting the courier).\n    *   **The Call:** General\
    \ Vance contacts her. A signal has hit the Antarctic array.\n    *   **The Refusal:**\
    \ Yuki requests the raw data sent to her cloud. She refuses to join a team. Vance\
    \ overrides her: the signal degrades outside the source. She must go.\n\n2.  **Arrival\
    \ & The Problem (Beat: Crossing the First Threshold - Physical):**\n    *   **Setting:**\
    \ The Ice Cube Neutrino Observatory, Antarctica.\n    *   **The Alien Signal:**\
    \ It is not binary or radio. It is a \"gravitational chord\"—a physical vibration\
    \ that induces synesthesia (tasting colors/feeling sound).\n    *   **The Challenger:**\
    \ Dr. Aris Thorne. He is loud, charismatic, and treats the signal like an encryption\
    \ puzzle. He challenges Yuki’s silence, interpreting it as arrogance.\n\n3.  **The\
    \ Mentor (Beat: Meeting the Mentor):**\n    *   **Event:** Overwhelmed by the\
    \ noise of the facility and the \"human static\" of the team, Yuki retreats to\
    \ a disused observation deck.\n    *   **The Mentor Figure:** \"Seven,\" a decommissioned\
    \ legacy android acting as a janitor/custodian. Seven is \"glitchy\" and processes\
    \ data through emotional subroutines rather than logic.\n    *   **Key Dialogue:**\
    \ Seven asks not what the signal *says*, but why it sounds \"lonely.\" This reframes\
    \ the problem for Yuki from linguistics to emotion.\n\n4.  **The Psychological\
    \ Threshold (Beat: Crossing the Threshold - Psychological):**\n    *   **Action:**\
    \ Yuki returns to the control room. Thorne is failing; his algorithms are rejecting\
    \ the signal as noise.\n    *   **The Connection (Constraint):** Yuki realizes\
    \ she must interface via neural link (direct mind-to-machine). She is terrified\
    \ of the vulnerability. Thorne sees her shaking. Instead of mocking her, he silently\
    \ steps between her and the General, buying her time and handing her his noise-canceling\
    \ headset. It is a moment of silent, \"us vs. them\" solidarity.\n    *   **The\
    \ Crossing:** Yuki drops her mental barriers. She stops analyzing the syntax and\
    \ allows herself to *feel* the alien intent.\n\n**II. Character Arc**\n*   **Start:**\
    \ Cold, armored, views language as a code to keep people out.\n*   **Middle:**\
    \ Forced to confront that her lack of empathy is a mistranslation of reality.\n\
    *   **End:** Vulnerable. She translates the message not by thinking, but by connecting.\n\
    \n**III. Executing Constraints**\n*   *Alien Signal:* Described as \"tasting like\
    \ ozone and grief,\" avoiding humanoid speech patterns.\n*   *Isolation:* Yuki\
    \ enters the room and immediately finds the corner with the widest sightlines;\
    \ flinches when someone stands too close.\n*   *Unconventional Mentor:* A broken\
    \ robot.\n\n***\n\n**STORY EXECUTION:**\n\nThe silence in Yuki’s Neo-Tokyo apartment\
    \ was expensive. In a city of forty million people, paying for the absence of\
    \ sound was the ultimate luxury. She sat in the center of her living room, surrounded\
    \ not by furniture, but by floating holographic glyphs of Linear B script. She\
    \ didn’t read them; she felt their architecture.\n\nWhen the red priority channel\
    \ blinked on her retinal display, she didn't answer. She simply stared at the\
    \ wall, willing the intrusion to vanish. It didn't.\n\n\"Dr. Tanaka,\" the voice\
    \ of General Vance bypassed her privacy filters, vibrating directly against her\
    \ mastoid bone. \"We have a confirmed event. Ice Cube Observatory. Antarctica.\"\
    \n\nYuki tapped her throat mic, her voice rusty from days of disuse. \"Send the\
    \ data packet. I’ll work from here.\"\n\n\"Negative. The signal is... contextual.\
    \ It degrades on transmission. You’re on a transport in twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"\
    I don't work in teams,\" Yuki said, her fingers twitching as she closed the Linear\
    \ B files. \"People create static. It interferes with the patterns.\"\n\n\"This\
    \ isn't a pattern, Doctor. It's a scream. And you’re the only one who might understand\
    \ the syntax.\"\n\n***\n\nThe Antarctic facility smelled of recycled air and stale\
    \ coffee. The \"War Room\" was a chaotic hive of military strategists and cryptographers\
    \ shouting over the hum of server banks. Yuki pulled her coat tighter, making\
    \ herself small. She moved to the periphery, avoiding eye contact, navigating\
    \ the room like a ghost to avoid the friction of bodies.\n\n\"You must be the\
