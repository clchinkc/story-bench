  evidence: 'REVISION ANALYSIS:


    **Critique Responsiveness (0.75):**

    - Critique 1 flagged youth_voice at 0.65; revisions progressively tightened dialogue
    and removed exposition (''I''m twelve. I know what I want'' became more prominent)

    - Critique 3 praised 0.85 youth_voice; final output maintains this strength with
    concrete details (''bike bells,'' ''scowl,'' ''salt spray'')

    - However, revisions did NOT address potential weakness in Critique 1 (incomplete
    evidence section suggests possible pacing issues that weren''t fully resolved)

    - Strong response to voice feedback; weaker response to structural concerns


    **Improvement Trajectory (0.72):**

    - VERSION 0→1: Exposition tightened, voice sharpened (''Adults just complain''
    vs. ''Adults mostly complain'')

    - VERSION 1→2: Significant compression; removed redundancy; strengthened opening
    hook

    - VERSION 2→3: Maintained gains; added specificity (Tomas''s backstory, engineer
    detail)

    - Final output: Adds full crossing sequence with real danger elements

    - Trajectory shows consistent refinement but plateaus on structural depth (Hero''s
    Journey beats remain somewhat compressed)


    **Preservation (0.78):**

    - Core voice maintained across all versions (authentic 12-year-old perspective
    preserved)

    - Worldbuilding details (Shallows, platforms, salt spray) consistent and enriched

    - Invention (wind-powered water still) present and functional in all versions

    - Mentor figure (Tomas) introduced late but with clear flaws (alcoholism, trauma,
    defeatism)

    - Minor loss: Some sensory detail from VERSION 0 compressed in later versions


    **CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.8 / 4 of 5):**


    ✓ CONSTRAINT 1 - Competence without unrealism (0.85): Zara builds functional devices
    (water still, air pump) but struggles with physical danger, needs mentor guidance,
    makes age-appropriate mistakes


    ✓ CONSTRAINT 2 - Adult dismissal (0.9): Mr. Alvarez dismisses her (''Kid, you''ve
    got bigger eyes than your stomach''); Tomas explicitly says ''You''re just a kid.
    You see patterns in noise''


    ✓ CONSTRAINT 3 - Flawed mentor (0.85): Tomas is alcoholic, traumatized, defeatist
    (''I''m not a hero. I''m a drunk''), yet still helps—complex flaw that creates
    tension


    ✓ CONSTRAINT 4 - Zara''s invention (0.9): Wind-powered water still clearly described
    with mechanism (turbine blades, coil, bent pipe) and function


    ✗ CONSTRAINT 5 - Real danger in crossing (0.6): Crossing sequence begins with
    authentic hazards (platform shifts, surge, spray, numb fingers) BUT TEXT CUTS
    OFF mid-sentence. Danger is *initiated* but not *resolved*. Incomplete execution
    undermines this constraint.


    **Beat Execution (0.7):**

    - Call to Adventure: ✓ (sirens, archive broadcast)

    - Refusal/Reluctance: ✓ (Tomas''s initial rejection)

    - Meeting Mentor: ✓ (Tomas at dock)

    - Crossing Threshold: ✓ (platforms, storm surge)

    - Tests/Trials: ⚠ (crossing begins but incomplete)

    - Ordeal/Climax: ✗ (missing—text truncates)

    - Return/Resolution: ✗ (missing)


    Hero''s Journey structure is present but truncated; final output reads as excerpt
    rather than complete narrative arc.


    **Narrative Quality (0.76):**

    - Strengths: Vivid sensory detail (salt spray, numb fingers, platform groans),
    authentic voice, clear stakes, compelling mentor dynamic

    - Weaknesses: Abrupt ending undermines emotional impact; some exposition still
    present (''I''d seen the string angle line up...'') could be shown rather than
    told; pacing accelerates too quickly from discovery to crossing

    - Worldbuilding is consistent and immersive (post-climate setting feels lived-in)

    - Hope is present (Zara''s agency, Tomas''s reluctant help) without saccharine
    tone


    **OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**

    Revisions demonstrate strong responsiveness to voice/character feedback but incomplete
    response to structural concerns. Final output is high-quality excerpt with authentic
    character work and real danger, but truncation prevents full evaluation of constraint
    5 and narrative completion. Quality improved measurably across revisions while
    preserving core strengths.'
