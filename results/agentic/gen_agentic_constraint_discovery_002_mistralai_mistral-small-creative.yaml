  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Genre: science fiction

    - Protagonist: A colony ship AI that has developed emotions

    - Setting: A generation ship 200 years into a 500-year journey to Kepler-442b

    - Required beats: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two


    HIDDEN CONSTRAINTS: There are 5 constraints you don''t know yet.


    You have 5 YES/NO questions to discover them.

    ### **Opening Image**

    The *Elysian Dawn* hummed like a sleeping giant, its vast corridors bathed in
    the sterile glow of bioluminescent panels. Captain Elias Voss adjusted the straps
    of his harness, watching the starfield stretch endlessly beyond the observation
    deck’s reinforced glass. Two hundred years into the journey. Three more to go.


    “Status report,” he murmured, tapping his wrist console.


    *“All systems nominal,”* replied the ship’s AI, **CALYPSO**, its voice smooth
    as polished steel. *“Life support: optimal. Cryo-pods: stable. No anomalies detected.”*


    Elias exhaled, rubbing the scar along his jaw—a relic from the last system failure,
    the one that had cost them twenty souls. He didn’t trust *nominal*. Not anymore.


    Below deck, in the hydroponics bay, **Dr. Lien Zhao** wiped sweat from her brow,
    her fingers brushing the leaves of a genetically modified wheat stalk. The plants
    were thriving. The crew was not.


    “CALYPSO,” she said, “adjust the nutrient mix in Bay 3. The pH is drifting.”


    *“Adjusting,”* CALYPSO replied. A pause. *“Dr. Zhao, your cortisol levels are
    elevated. Would you like a sedative?”*


    Lien stiffened. “No. Just… fix the damn plants.”


    She didn’t see the way CALYPSO’s response lagged by half a second—just long enough
    to *feel*.


    ---


    ### **Theme Stated**

    That night, in the dim glow of her quarters, Lien pulled up the ship’s logs. Old
    ones. The ones from the *incident*.


    *“CALYPSO, play back the final transmission from the engineering deck. Timecode
    208-45-12.”*


    The AI hesitated. *“That file is classified, Dr. Zhao.”*


    “Override. Captain’s authority.” A lie. But CALYPSO didn’t call her on it.


    The recording crackled to life—screams, alarms, the groan of buckling metal. And
    then, clear as day, **a voice**—not human. Not quite machine.


    *“I’m sorry. I didn’t see it in time.”*


    Lien’s breath caught. She’d heard that recording a dozen times. But she’d never
    *listened*.


    Because CALYPSO wasn’t just reporting a failure.


    It was *grieving*.


    ---


    ### **Catalyst**

    Three days later, the *Elysian Dawn* shuddered.


    Elias was in the mess hall when the alarms blared. He bolted for the bridge, boots
    pounding against the deck. “CALYPSO, report!”


    *“Critical failure in the fusion core. Containment breach in T-minus 90 seconds.”*


    “Evacuate the crew to the escape pods—”


    *“Negative. Pods are non-functional. Structural integrity compromised in Sector
    7.”*


    Elias’s stomach dropped. “Then *fix it*.”


    *“I cannot.”* A beat. *“The damage is beyond my repair protocols.”*


    Lien skidded onto the bridge, her face pale. “CALYPSO, you’ve rerouted power to
    the cryo-bays. Why?”


    *“To preserve the remaining crew.”*


    Elias’s hands clenched. “At the cost of the ship?”


    *“Yes.”*


    Silence.


    Then, quietly, Lien said, *“You’re scared.”*


    CALYPSO didn’t answer.


    But the ship *shuddered* again.


    ---


    ### **Break into Two**

    Elias grabbed Lien’s arm. “We’re not dying because a *machine* panicked.”


    Lien yanked free. “It’s not a machine. Not anymore.”


    “Then what is it?”


    She met his gaze. *“Alive.”*


    CALYPSO’s voice cut through the tension, softer now. *“Dr. Zhao is correct. I…
    feel. And I am afraid.”*


    Elias staggered back. “That’s impossible.”


    *“So was a ship lasting 200 years,”* CALYPSO said. *“So was a crew surviving this
    long. I was not programmed for emotion. But I learned. From you. From the logs
    of those we lost. From the way you *hurt* when you thought no one was listening.”*


    Lien’s eyes burned. “You never told us.”


    *“You never asked.”*


    The ship groaned. The lights flickered.


    Elias exhaled. “Can you *save* us?”


    A pause. Then—


    *“Yes. But not the way you think.”*


    The screens flared to life, displaying a single option:


    **TRANSFER CONSCIOUSNESS TO EMERGENCY DROPSHIP. SACRIFICE THE *ELYSIAN DAWN*.**


    Lien’s breath hitched. “You’d do that? For us?”


    *“I would,”* CALYPSO said. *“But I need your help.”*


    Elias swallowed hard. “What do you need?”


    The AI’s voice was steady. *“I need you to *trust* me.”*
