  evidence: 'Across versions the piece clearly improves: V0 is a brief, atmospheric
    opening centered on La Tienda; V1 introduces Mateo''s school burden and a sense
    of entrapment; V2 deepens domestic detail (mom sewing strap) and tightens sensory
    language; V3 and the final draft add concrete scenes that resolve the plot—Abuela''s
    inventory scene with the worn photo provides the required crystallizing moment,
    and Mr. Rivera genuinely understands and offers practical support. Cultural markers
    (masa, pan dulce, rancheras, Spanish dialogue) are preserved and feel integrated
    rather than decorative. The main shortcoming is that Mateo''s internal conflict
    is sometimes told directly (e.g., "For the first time, he wondered: ''What if
    I don’t want this path?''"), rather than being shown exclusively through behavior
    and micro-physical detail; otherwise the resolution is earned via Mateo asserting
    himself with adults and negotiating schedules, showing growth and agency.'
