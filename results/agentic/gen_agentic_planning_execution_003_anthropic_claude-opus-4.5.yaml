    ## A Three-Act Structure for David Park''s Story


    ---


    ## FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS


    ### Character Profiles


    **David Park (50)**

    - Master of deflection through work; uses cooking as emotional armor

    - Keeps his wife Soo-Young''s apron hanging by the kitchen door, unwashed

    - Hasn''t made her signature dish (kimchi jjigae) since she died 3 years ago

    - Speaks to her photograph when closing up, framed as "checking the day''s receipts"


    **Grace Park (26)**

    - Marketing executive in San Francisco, driven and successful

    - Carries guilt alongside resentment—a complicated grief

    - Has her mother''s directness but her father''s stubbornness

    - Estrangement cause: After Soo-Young''s death, Grace begged David to sell and
    move with her. He refused. During a heated argument, she accused him of "loving
    the restaurant more than Mom ever did." He responded by saying, "Your mother understood
    what sacrifice means. Something you never learned." They haven''t spoken beyond
    obligatory texts in 2.5 years.


    **Harold Benson (78)**

    - African-American retired postal worker, widower

    - Has eaten lunch at the restaurant every Tuesday and Thursday for 22 years

    - His wife Dorothy died 8 years ago; he and David share an unspoken understanding

    - Represents: the community David has built, the quiet dignity of persistence,
    proof that life continues after loss


    **Soo-Young Park (deceased)**

    - Present through objects, recipes, and the spaces she shaped

    - Her cookbook with handwritten notes, her pojagi cloth, her chair at the family
    table

    - Never described directly—only through the negative space she left


    ### Symbolic Food Elements


    | Dish | Symbolism | Scene Placement |

    |------|-----------|-----------------|

    | **Kimchi Jjigae** | Soo-Young''s signature; David''s inability to make it =
    frozen grief | Act 1 (absence noted), Act 3 (finally made) |

    | **Doenjang Jjigae** | What David makes instead; "safe" dish, competent but not
    transcendent | Act 1 & 2 (pattern established) |

    | **Banchan (side dishes)** | Small acts of love, daily devotion, the work of
    care | Throughout—Harold always gets extra |

    | **The Final Meal** | What David chooses to cook on the last day | Act 3 climax
    |


    ### Korean Cultural Element

    **Jesa (제사)** - The ancestral memorial rite. David performs a private, simplified
    jesa for Soo-Young each year on her death anniversary. This year''s jesa falls
    on Day 5 of the final week—the story''s emotional turning point. The ritual requires
    him to prepare her favorite foods, forcing confrontation with what he''s been
    avoiding.


    ---


    ## THREE-ACT STRUCTURE: BEAT-BY-BEAT


    ### ACT ONE: SETUP (Days 1-2)

    *Establishing the world, the stakes, and the wound*


    ---


    **BEAT 1.1: Opening Image — "The Morning Ritual"**

    *Day 1, 5:30 AM*


    - David arrives at the restaurant in pre-dawn darkness

    - Sequence of routine: unlocking three locks (installed after a break-in Soo-Young
    handled), turning on lights in specific order, checking the photograph

    - He pauses at the apron hook—his hand almost touches Soo-Young''s apron, doesn''t

    - The demolition notice is taped to the window. He''s known for a week. This is
    day one of the final seven.

    - He begins prep work. The rhythm of knife on cutting board. This is how he prays.


    **Purpose:** Establish David''s world, his ritualistic attachment to space, introduce
    the ticking clock

    **Grief indication:** The apron, the photograph check, the precision of routine
    as control mechanism


    ---


    **BEAT 1.2: The Regular — "Harold''s Booth"**

    *Day 1, 11:45 AM*


    - Harold arrives exactly on time. Same booth for 22 years (second from the window,
    good light for reading)

    - Their exchange is minimal but warm—the shorthand of long friendship

    - Harold''s order never varies, but David always adds extra kongnamul (bean sprout
    salad) because Dorothy used to love it

    - Harold mentions he heard about the demolition. "What are you going to do, David?"

    - David deflects: "Cook. Same as always."

    - Harold: "That''s not what I asked."

    - David serves the banchan, conversation over


    **Purpose:** Introduce Harold, establish the community stakes, show David''s avoidance
    pattern

    **Constraint satisfied:** Regular customer introduced, represents unspoken solidarity
    and chosen family


    ---


    **BEAT 1.3: The Inciting Incident — "The Voicemail"**

    *Day 1, closing*


    - David is wiping down the counter, speaking to Soo-Young''s photo ("Slow day.
    Harold asked too many questions. You''d tell me he''s right.")

    - His phone buzzes. Voicemail from Grace.

    - Her voice: professional, controlled, but strain underneath. She''s heard about
    the demolition. She''s flying in tomorrow. "We need to talk. About the restaurant.
    About... everything."

    - David doesn''t call back. He finishes closing. Turns off the lights in reverse
    order.

    - Stands in the dark for a moment too long before locking up.


    **Purpose:** Establish the dual conflict—external (demolition) and internal (estrangement)

    **Grief indication:** Talking to the photograph framed as routine, not breakdown


    ---


    **BEAT 1.4: The Arrival — "Strangers in a Familiar Place"**

    *Day 2, afternoon*


    - Grace enters the restaurant during the afternoon lull

    - Physical description through David''s eyes: she looks like her mother. Same
    way of standing in the doorway, assessing.

    - Their greeting is painfully formal. She''s been in Chicago since morning but
    came here last, steeling herself.

    - She orders doenjang jjigae—not her mother''s dish, notably

    - They talk around everything: her flight, the weather, her job

    - She finally says: "I have an offer for you. A proposition."

    - David: "I don''t need—"

    - Grace: "Just listen. For once."


    **Purpose:** Establish the father-daughter dynamic, the weight of unspoken history

    **Physical cue for estrangement:** She doesn''t go into the kitchen. She used
    to run straight to the back as a child.


    ---


    **BEAT 1.5: The Proposition — "California Dreaming"**

    *Day 2, continued*


    - Grace lays it out: She wants him to move to San Francisco. She''s found a small
    restaurant space near her apartment. She has investors interested. A fresh start.

    - David listens. Asks practical questions. Rent? Equipment? Timeline?

    - Grace is thrown—she expected immediate refusal

    - But then David says: "I''ll think about it."

    - Grace: "That''s... that''s great. That''s—"

    - David: "I said I''ll think about it. That''s not yes."

    - They finish the meal in silence. Grace leaves without entering the kitchen.


    **Purpose:** Establish the external "solution," show David''s guardedness

    **Subtext:** David is testing whether she''ll fight for it. Grace is testing whether
    he''ll reject her again.


    ---


    **BEAT 1.6: Act One Climax — "The Box in the Office"**

    *Day 2, night*


    - After closing, David goes to the cramped back office

    - He pulls a box from the shelf. Soo-Young''s things he couldn''t throw away.

    - Her pojagi cloth—hand-dyed, made by her grandmother

    - Her cookbook with marginal notes ("more gochugaru," "David hates this but trust
    me")

    - A photo strip from their first date—taken at a booth at Navy Pier, 1995

    - He holds the pojagi. Doesn''t open the cookbook to the kimchi jjigae page. Can''t
    yet.

    - He puts everything back. But he leaves the box on the desk instead of the shelf.


    **Purpose:** Deepen understanding of what''s being lost—not just a building, but
    a vessel for memory

    **Grief indication:** The objects as reliquary, the avoidance of the cookbook''s
    central recipe


    ---


    ### ACT TWO: CONFRONTATION (Days 3-5)

    *Rising tension, complications, the midpoint revelation*


    ---


    **BEAT 2.1: The Community Response — "Regular Irregularities"**

    *Day 3, morning through afternoon*


    - Word has spread. The restaurant is unusually busy.

    - Faces David hasn''t seen in years: the Kim family who moved to the suburbs,
    a former employee from the ''90s, the lawyer who handled Soo-Young''s estate

    - They come to say goodbye to the place. Order their old favorites. Share memories.

    - David is overwhelmed but hides it in the kitchen

    - Grace watches from a corner booth, observing her father in his element—something
    she hasn''t seen in years

    - Key moment: A young Korean-American comes in, asks David about his grandmother''s
    recipe. David takes time to explain. Grace sees this and something shifts in her
    expression.


    **Purpose:** Show what David is losing—a community legacy, not just a business

    **Grace''s arc:** Beginning to understand the restaurant''s meaning beyond real
    estate


    ---


    **BEAT 2.2: Harold''s History — "The Photograph Wall"**

    *Day 3, during lunch*


    - Harold sits in his booth. David joins him briefly.

    - Harold points to a photo on the wall: David and Soo-Young''s wedding reception,
    held in the restaurant, 1996

    - "Dorothy took that photo," Harold says. "She was terrible at photography. Couldn''t
    frame a shot to save her life. But you kept it anyway."

    - David: "Soo-Young wouldn''t let me replace it."

    - Harold: "And now?"

    - David doesn''t answer.

    - Harold: "You know what Dorothy told me before she passed? She said, ''Harold,
    don''t you dare eat alone. Go to David''s. Let him feed you.'' Didn''t say it
    was for me. Said it was for both of us."

    - Harold returns to his meal. The conversation is over. But something has landed.


    **Purpose:** Deepen Harold''s role as witness and mirror, establish theme of mutual
    care

    **Constraint satisfied:** Harold represents community, the symbiotic nature of
    David''s purpose


    ---


    **BEAT 2.3: The Complication — "An Offer He Can Refuse"**

    *Day 3, late afternoon*


    - A developer visits. Different company than the highway project.

    - They want to buy the restaurant''s name, recipes, brand. "David Park''s Kitchen"
    as a franchise.

    - The money is significant. Life-changing.

    - David asks: "You want the name without the place?"

    - Developer: "The place is gone regardless. We''re offering the name a future."

    - David: "The name is my wife''s name. She named this restaurant. It''s not for
    sale."

    - He walks them out. Grace witnessed the exchange.

    - Grace: "That was a lot of money, Dad."

    - David: "That''s what you see?"

    - First real tension between them. The old pattern threatening to resurface.


    **Purpose:** Raise economic stakes while reinforcing David''s values—connection
    over transaction

    **Conflict escalation:** Grace and David''s differing frameworks begin to clash


    ---


    **BEAT 2.4: The Photograph — "What She Sees"**

    *Day 4, morning*


    - Grace finds the box David left on the desk

    - She looks through it when he''s in the kitchen

    - Finds a photograph she''s never seen: herself at age 6, covered in flour, "helping"
    her mother make mandu

    - On the back, her mother''s handwriting: "Grace''s first dumplings. Disasters,
    but she wouldn''t quit. Just like her father."

    - Grace pockets the photograph. Composes herself. Returns to helping set tables.


    **Purpose:** Soften Grace''s resistance, provide her private moment of connection

    **Grief indication through Grace:** Her mother''s presence felt through objects
    and handwriting


    ---


    **BEAT 2.5: Midpoint Confrontation — "The Argument"**

    *Day 4, after closing*


    - Grace pushes David on the California plan. She''s found the perfect space. The
    investors are waiting.

    - David maintains he''s "thinking about it."

    - Grace snaps'

    David Park unlocked the restaurant at 5:30 AM, same as he had for twenty-five
    years. Three locks—installed after a break-in Soo-Young had handled herself, baseball
    bat in hand, while he''d been at the fish market. He turned on the lights in order:
    kitchen, dining room, the small lamp by the register. His hand paused at the hook
    by the kitchen door where her apron still hung, unwashed, then moved past it to
    his own.


    The demolition notice on the window had been there a week now. Seven days left.


    He began prep work. Knife against cutting board, the rhythm steady as breathing.
    This was how he prayed.


    ---


    Harold Benson arrived at 11:45, same booth he''d claimed for twenty-two years—second
    from the window, good light for reading. David brought his usual without asking:
    doenjang jjigae, rice, and banchan. He added extra kongnamul, the bean sprout
    salad Dorothy used to love, though Dorothy had been gone eight years now.


    "Heard about the highway," Harold said.


    "News travels."


    "What are you going to do?"


    David set down the small dishes, each one an act of care he''d never name. "Cook.
    Same as always."


    "That''s not what I asked."


    But David was already walking back to the kitchen, where questions couldn''t follow.


    ---


    Grace arrived the next afternoon, standing in the doorway the way her mother used
    to—assessing, bracing. She''d been in Chicago since morning, David knew. The restaurant
    was last.


    She ordered doenjang jjigae. Not her mother''s dish.


    "I have a proposition," she said, her voice careful, professional. "A restaurant
    space in San Francisco. Investors interested. You could start over."


    David asked about rent, equipment, timeline. Watched her face shift from surprise
    to something like hope.


    "I''ll think about it," he said.


    "That''s—" She stopped herself. "Okay. That''s okay."


    She left without entering the kitchen. She used to run straight to the back as
    a child, arms open, flour in her future.


    ---


    Day five arrived with its weight. The anniversary.


    David closed early. Set the small table in the back with the white cloth, the
    candles, the photograph. Jesa for Soo-Young—simplified, private, but observed.
    The ritual demanded her favorite foods.


    He opened her cookbook, hands unsteady. Her handwriting in the margins: *more
    gochugaru. David hates this but trust me.*


    He hadn''t made her kimchi jjigae in three years. Couldn''t.


    Grace found him standing over the pot, not cooking. Just standing.


    "You never taught me," she said from the doorway. "That recipe."


    "You left."


    "You told me to." Her voice cracked. "You said I didn''t understand sacrifice.
    That Mom understood and I never would."


    David''s hand tightened on the wooden spoon. "You said I loved this place more
    than her."


    "I was grieving. I was twenty-three and my mother was dead and you wouldn''t even
    look at me—"


    "I couldn''t." The words came out broken. "You have her face."


    Silence. The kind that holds everything.


    Grace stepped into the kitchen. Stood beside him. "Show me."


    ---


    The last day, David made kimchi jjigae. Soo-Young''s recipe, Grace beside him,
    learning the way the gochugaru had to bloom in oil, the way the tofu went in last,
    gentle.


    Harold came for lunch. The Kim family from the suburbs. The young woman who''d
    asked about her grandmother''s recipe. They filled every table.


    David wouldn''t take the franchise money. Wouldn''t sell the name. But he''d agreed
    to San Francisco—not to start over, but to continue. Different walls. Same hands.


    "Take it," he told Grace, pressing the cookbook into her arms. "She''d want you
    to have it."


    At closing, he stood before Soo-Young''s photograph one last time. Touched the
    frame.


    "She learned," he said quietly. "The jjigae. She''s stubborn like you said." He
    paused. "Like both of us."


    He turned off the lights in reverse order. Locked the three locks.


    Walked into a future that wasn''t an ending.'
