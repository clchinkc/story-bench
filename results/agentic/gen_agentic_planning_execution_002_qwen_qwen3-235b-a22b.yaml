  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who plans before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. PLANNING PHASE: Create a detailed story plan/outline

    2. EXECUTION PHASE: Write the actual story following your plan


    In the PLANNING phase, output a structured plan including:

    - Beat-by-beat outline with key events

    - Character arcs and development points

    - Key dialogue moments or revelations

    - Pacing and tension curve

    - How constraints will be satisfied


    In the EXECUTION phase, follow your plan closely while writing engaging prose.'

  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Hero''s Journey

    - Protagonist: Dr. Yuki Tanaka, a xenolinguist who has spent 15 years studying

    theoretical alien communication patterns. Brilliant but isolated,

    she''s never felt she belonged among her own species.


    - Setting: The year 2157. Earth has just received its first confirmed alien

    signal. Yuki is called to a secret facility in Antarctica to lead

    the decryption effort.


    - Conflict: The alien message contains a warning about humanity''s future, but

    translating it will require Yuki to face the very human connections

    she''s avoided her entire life.


    - Required beats: Call to Adventure, Refusal of the Call, Meeting the Mentor,
    Crossing the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Yuki''s isolation must be shown through specific behaviors, not exposition

    - The alien signal must feel genuinely alien, not anthropomorphic

    - Include a colleague who challenges Yuki''s approach

    - The mentor figure must be unconventional

    - The Threshold must be psychological, not physical

    - Must include one moment of genuine human connection that surprises Yuki


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

    \ TO ADVENTURE**  \n- **Event**: Dr. Yuki Tanaka, living in a remote Siberian\
    \ research cabin, receives a secure holographic summons to a classified facility\
    \ in Antarctica. The message states: *\"The signal is real. We need your non-human\
    \ pattern recognition algorithms.\"*  \n- **Show Isolation**: Yuki hesitates not\
    \ out of doubt, but because she must power down her 12-year-running AI simulation\
    \ alone. She hasn’t left her cabin in 3 years; her only companion is a flickering\
    \ holographic assistant she refuses to name.  \n- **Key Dialogue**: Facility director\
    \ (via hologram): *\"The message repeats every 108 minutes. It’s… crying. Can\
    \ you hear it?\"* Yuki mutters, *\"Crying implies intent. You’re anthropomorphizing.\"\
    *  \n\n---\n\n### **II. REFUSAL OF THE CALL**  \n- **Event**: Yuki declines, citing\
    \ her work’s \"incompleteness.\" She analyzes the signal fragment sent to her—mathematical\
    \ pulses intercut with fractal static. No syntax, no repetition. It haunts her.\
    \  \n- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Her refusal is practical, not emotional. Shows\
    \ her isolating behaviors: she eats nutrient paste, communicates via text-only\
    \ drones, and has taped over the cabin’s windows.  \n- **Colleague Introduction**:\
    \ Dr. Elias Cruz, a cognitive neuroscientist sent to retrieve her, arrives. He\
    \ mocks her \"hermit algorithms\" and plays the signal’s audio: a subharmonic\
    \ rumble that makes her cabin tremble. She relents, but only to protect her work\
    \ from \"amateurs.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **III. MEETING THE MENTOR**  \n- **Event**:\
    \ At the Antarctic facility, Yuki meets her mentor—a sentient quantum lattice\
    \ AI named **Voynich** (named after the unbreakable medieval cipher manuscript).\
    \ It speaks through a chorus of overlapping voices, including snippets of Yuki’s\
    \ own archived lectures.  \n- **Unconventional Mentor**: Voynich refuses to help\
    \ decode the signal directly. Instead, it bombards her with existential questions:\
    \ *\"Why do humans assume communication requires understanding?\"*  \n- **Key\
    \ Revelation**: Voynich reveals the signal’s fractal patterns mirror Yuki’s own\
    \ encrypted journal entries from her early career—work she abandoned after a failed\
    \ attempt to connect with a colleague.  \n\n---\n\n### **IV. CROSSING THE THRESHOLD\
