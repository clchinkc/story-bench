  content: 'The first thing Sarah Chen did in Greyharbor was measure the silence.


    She counted the seconds between the foghorn’s groan and its echo on the cliffs—three,
    sometimes four. She noted the way sound dulled in the wet air: boots on boards,
    waves against pylons, the distant clink of rigging. She filed away the empty storefronts
    along the harbor road: “BEACH TREATS,” “CAPTAIN JENKINS’ CHARTS,” “GREYHARBOR
    SOUVENIRS,” all windows papered over or hollow-eyed. Even the gulls were quiet,
    their silhouettes swallowed quickly by the rolling white.


    Fog like this could hide anything. Or anyone.


    She clicked her pen, wrote “visibility: 10–15 ft, variable” in the small notebook
    that rode in her jacket pocket. She underlined “variable” twice.


    “Most folks just call it ‘thick,’” Sheriff Barnes said beside her, breath making
    short ghosts. He was barrel-chested, late fifties, cap pulled low. His badge had
    a worn groove along one edge, like it had been thumbed often. “You don’t have
    to grade it.”


    Sarah capped the pen with a neat, final motion. “It changes how people move. What
    they think they can get away with.”


    He eyed her, as if weighing a response, then jerked his chin toward the wharf.
    “Harbor’s this way. I’ll introduce you to your kingdom.”


    They walked along the creaking planks, fog tightening around them like cotton.
    A lobster boat, the Merrilee Anne, loomed out of nowhere, hull streaked, name
    half-flaked off. A man in a stained watch cap stood on deck, sorting traps with
    the slow precision of someone who did not intend to hurry for anyone.


    “That’s Eli Moran,” Barnes said. “Been here since dirt. Eli, this is Detective
    Chen, from away.”


    Eli’s eyes, a pale, watery blue, flicked over Sarah, then past her to the fog
    behind, as if checking to see who else might be listening.


    “Detective, huh?” His voice had the rough edge of a lifelong smoker. “Didn’t know
    we rated that.”


    Sarah took in the calluses on his hands, the way his boots were new while the
    rest of him was not, the faint smear of bright red paint along his cuff that didn’t
    match his boat. “I’m just here to help,” she said. “You head out in this?”


    “Fog’s like any other thing.” Eli shrugged, too casual. “You learn where not to
    bump.”


    He said it like someone who’d bumped something recently. Sarah made a small note:
    “Eli Moran—new boots, old boat, paint residue, evasive.”


    Barnes clapped her shoulder. “You’ll learn the currents. Greyharbor’s not like
    the city.”


    She didn’t correct him. She didn’t say “Boston” or “Task Force Eleven” or “warehouse”
    or “wrong door, wrong time.” She pressed her fingers briefly against the scar
    hidden beneath her sleeve, a neat crescent along her wrist, and let the fog take
    the memory back.


    They were halfway along the outer pier when the radio on Barnes’s belt crackled.


    “Sheriff, you on?”


    Barnes thumbed the receiver. “Yeah, go ahead.”


    “Got a call from the lighthouse road. Kid walking his dog says there’s… uh… a
    body on the north beach. Looks like it washed up. Tide’s still going out.”


    There was a pause, thick as the fog.


    “We’re on our way,” Barnes said. He looked at Sarah. “Guess you picked a good
    week to join us.”


    She was already moving. “How far’s the beach?”


    “Quarter mile. We’ll take the cruiser.”


    “No,” Sarah said. “We walk. Tide’s going out, he said. I want to see the tracks
    before they’re gone.”


    Barnes studied her for a second, then nodded. “This way.”


    The fog made the world small. The road, the scrub grass, the faint crunch of their
    boots—everything existed in a gray bubble with soft, wet edges. Sarah counted
    fence posts as they passed, timed her breath to her steps. At post twelve, the
    air shifted, carrying a new smell: iodine, rot, the faint metallic tang of blood.


    They reached the top of the dune. The beach unfolded below, a strip of wet sand
    wrapped in white. There was the kid with the dog, a golden retriever straining
    at the leash; Barnes waved him back. Sarah scanned the shoreline.


    She spotted the body by absence: a shape the fog refused to swallow.


    Male, mid-thirties. Jeans, dark jacket, one shoe missing. Arms twisted awkwardly,
    head at an angle that suggested the neck had broken before the sea claimed him.
    Seaweed strung across his chest like crude ribbons.


    Sarah did not go straight to the corpse. She moved inland first, eyes sweeping
    the sand for prints, scuffs, drag marks. Fog beaded on her lashes. She crouched,
    touching a faint double track leading from the steps down from the road—small
    feet, probably the kid—and a set of broader prints, partially blurred by the creeping
    tide.


    “Barnes,” she said, pointing. “These came before the kid. Heel strike, deeper
    on the left. Someone else was here.”


    “Could’ve been yesterday. Beach gets walked.”


    “The tide would’ve taken them,” she said. “These are fresh.”


    She followed them down, parallel to the waterline, then back toward the dunes.
    They vanished into the fog.


    At the body, she stopped three feet short, letting her gaze travel systematically:
    hands (no defensive wounds visible), pockets (inside out on the right, not the
    left), neck (ligature mark, thin, high), face—


    Her breath hitched once, and she made herself finish the scan before letting the
    recognition surface.


    A small tattoo on his wrist, half-obscured by sand and kelp: a stylized key ringed
    by thirteen dots.


    Her hand went, unthinking, to her own wrist, to the scar that sat exactly where
    his ink lay.


    “Sarah?” Barnes’s voice had lost some of its bluff. “You know him?”


    “Not personally,” she said, though her mouth had gone dry. “But I’ve seen that
    symbol before.”


    “You want to share with the class?”


    She swallowed, eyes on the key. “Task Force Eleven had a case two years ago. Smuggling,
    disappearances. We were tracking a group that used keys like that for identification.
    We never got them all.”


    “You said you were here for a change of pace,” Barnes said carefully.


    “I said I was here to help,” she replied.


    The fog thickened for a moment, curling close, muting the world until it was just
    her, the dead man, and the ghost of an old case she had not, apparently, escaped.


    She straightened, every motion deliberate. “We need the beach sealed. Full sweep
    before the tide erases what’s left. And I’ll need to call Boston.” The word sat
    heavy between them.


    Barnes’s jaw tensed. “You sure you want to dredge that back up? Sounds like you
    left it for a reason.”


    Sarah looked down at the ink on the dead man’s skin, at the faint imprint of rope
    around his throat. In the distance, through the fog, she thought she heard a boat
    engine cut suddenly, as if someone out on the water had decided, at that exact
    moment, to listen instead of move.


    Fog, she thought, was not just for hiding. It carried things—sound, secrets, unfinished
    business—from where they’d been left to where they could no longer be ignored.


    She uncapped her pen, wrote “Case overlap: probable” in sharp, controlled letters,
    and underlined it.


    Then she clicked the pen once, a small, decisive sound.


    “Sheriff,” she said. “Either Greyharbor is part of what I ran from, or it’s where
    it ends. I need to decide which I’m treating it as.”


    Barnes searched her face. “And?”


    Sarah looked out into the white, toward the unseen harbor, the boats, the locals
    who thought fog could keep them safe.


    “I’ll make the call,” she said. “And I’ll reopen the file.”'

    **FEEDBACK:** Three beats land clearly. Minor note: the transition from Setup\

    short ghosts. Barrel-chested, late fifties, cap pulled low, badge worn along one
    edge. “You don’t have to grade it.”


    “It changes how people move,” Sarah said, capping the pen with a neat, final motion.
    “What they think they can get away with.”


    He eyed her, then jerked his chin toward the wharf. “Harbor’s this way. I’ll introduce
    you to your kingdom.”


    They walked along creaking planks, fog tightening around them. A lobster boat,
    the Merrilee Anne, loomed out of nowhere, hull streaked, name half-flaked off.
    A man in a stained watch cap stood on deck, sorting traps with slow, precise movements.


    “That’s Eli Moran,” Barnes said. “Been here since dirt. Eli, this is Detective
    Chen, from away.”


    Eli’s pale eyes flicked over Sarah, then past her into the fog, as if checking
    who else might be listening.


    “Detective, huh?” His voice had a smoker’s rasp. “Didn’t know we rated that.”


    Sarah took in the calluses on his hands, the way his boots were new while the
    rest of him was not, the faint smear of bright red paint on his cuff that didn’t
    match his boat. “I’m just here to help,” she said. “You head out in this?”


    “Fog’s like any other thing.” Eli shrugged, too casual. “You learn where not to
    bump.”


    He said it like someone who’d bumped something recently. Sarah made a small note:
    “Eli Moran—new boots, old boat, paint residue, evasive.”


    Barnes clapped her shoulder. “You’ll learn the currents. Greyharbor’s not like
    the city.”


    She didn’t correct him. She didn’t say “Boston” or “Task Force Eleven” or “warehouse”
    or “wrong door, wrong time.” Her fingers brushed the neat crescent scar hidden
    beneath her sleeve, and she let the fog close over the memory.


    The sheriff’s office sat a block up from the harbor, a squat building with peeling
    blue trim. Inside, coffee steamed on a hot plate. Two desks, one bulletin board,
    one map of the county pinned with colored tacks. Barnes gestured to a clear desk
    by the window.


    “Yours,” he said. “We do fine without much fuss. Drunk tanks, domestic calls,
    the odd bar fight. Summer’s our busy season. Off-season’s mostly paperwork and
    bad TV.”


    Sarah set her notebook dead center on the blotter, squared the edges of the inbox
    with the desk, tested the chair’s swivel. The window gave her a slice of harbor
    and a solid wall of fog. No horizon.


    “Any open cases I should know about?” she asked.


    Barnes scratched his jaw. “Couple of missing lobster pots Eli’s been grousing
    about, some kids breaking into the arcade down on Wharf Street. Nothing that needs
    a Task Force.” He watched her when he said it.


    She kept her face neutral, uncapped her pen, and wrote a date and time at the
    top of a blank page. A clean line.


    The radio on Barnes’s belt crackled.


    “Sheriff, you on?”


    Barnes thumbed the receiver. “Yeah, go ahead.”


    “Got a call from the lighthouse road. Kid walking his dog says there’s… uh… a
    body on the north beach. Looks like it washed up. Tide’s still going out.”


    Silence settled between the bursts of static, as thick as the fog outside.


    “We’re on our way,” Barnes said. He looked at Sarah. “Guess you picked a good
    week to join us.”


    She was already standing. “How far’s the beach?”


    “Quarter mile. We’ll take the cruiser.”


    “No,” Sarah said. “We walk. Tide’s going out, he said. I want to see the tracks
    before they’re gone.”


    Barnes studied her for a second, then nodded. “This way.”


    The fog made the world small. Road, scrub grass, the faint crunch of their boots—everything
    existed in a gray bubble with soft, wet edges. Sarah counted fence posts as they
    passed. At post twelve, the air shifted, bringing iodine, rot, the faint metallic
    tang of blood.


    They reached the top of the dune. The beach lay below, a strip of wet sand wrapped
    in white. A teenage boy held a straining golden retriever at the base of the steps;
    Barnes waved him back. Sarah scanned the shoreline.


    She spotted the body by absence: a shape the fog refused to swallow.


    Male, mid-thirties. Jeans, dark jacket, one shoe missing. Arms twisted awkwardly,
    head at an angle that suggested the neck had broken before the sea claimed him.
    Seaweed strung across his chest.


    Sarah did not go straight to the corpse. She moved inland first, eyes sweeping
    the sand for prints, scuffs, drag marks. Fog beaded on her lashes. She crouched,
    touching a faint double track from the steps—small feet, probably the kid—and
    a broader set of prints, partially blurred by the creeping tide.


    “Barnes,” she said, pointing. “These came before the kid. Heel strike, deeper
    on the left. Someone else was here.”


    “Could’ve been yesterday. Beach gets walked.”


    “The tide would’ve taken them,” she said. “These are fresh.”


    She followed the prints down, parallel to the waterline, then back toward the
    dunes. They vanished into the gray.


    At the body, she stopped three feet short, letting her gaze travel systematically:
    hands (no obvious defensive wounds), pockets (inside out on the right, not the
    left), neck (thin, high ligature mark), face—


    Her breath hitched; she made herself finish the scan before letting recognition
    rise.


    A small tattoo on his wrist, half-obscured by sand and kelp: a stylized key ringed
    by thirteen dots.


    Her own hand went to her wrist, to the scar that sat exactly where his ink lay.


    “Sarah?” Barnes’s voice had lost some of its bluff. “You know him?”


    “Not personally,” she said, mouth dry. “But I’ve seen that symbol before.”


    “You want to share with the class?”


    “Task Force Eleven had a case two years ago,” she said, eyes on the key. “Smuggling.
    Disappearances. They used that mark for identification. We never got them all.”


    “You said you were here for a change of pace,” Barnes said carefully.


    “I said I was here to help.”


    The fog thickened, curling close, muting the world until it was just her, the
    dead man, and the shape of a case she had not, it seemed, outrun. Somewhere offshore,
    a boat engine cut abruptly, leaving a pocket of listening silence.


    She straightened, every motion deliberate. “We need the beach sealed,” she said.
    “Full sweep before the tide erases what’s left. And I’ll need to call Boston.”


    Barnes’s jaw tensed. “You sure you want to dredge that back up? Sounds like you
    left it for a reason.”


    She looked down at the ink on the dead man’s skin, at the faint imprint of rope
    around his throat. The fog pressed in, not just hiding the harbor and the boats
    and Eli’s old hull, but holding them close, as if the town itself were waiting
    to see what she would do.


    Sarah uncapped her pen, wrote “Case overlap: probable” in sharp, controlled letters,
    and underlined it.


    Then she clicked the pen once, a small, decisive sound that seemed to mark a line
    on more than the page.


    “I’ll make the call,” she said. “And I’ll reopen the file.”'

    The first thing Sarah Chen did in Greyharbor was measure the silence.


    She counted the seconds between the foghorn’s groan and its echo on the cliffs—three,
    sometimes four. She noted the way sound dulled in the wet air: boots on boards,
    waves against pylons, the distant clink of rigging. Empty storefronts along the
    harbor road—“BEACH TREATS,” “CAPTAIN JENKINS’ CHARTS,” “GREYHARBOR SOUVENIRS”—watched
    her with papered or hollow windows. Even the gulls were quiet, their silhouettes
    eaten quickly by the rolling white.


    Fog like this could hide anything. Or anyone.


    She clicked her pen, wrote “visibility: 10–15 ft, variable” in the small notebook
    in her jacket pocket, and underlined “variable” twice.


    “Most folks just call it ‘thick,’” Sheriff Barnes said beside her, breath making
    short ghosts. Barrel-chested, late fifties, cap pulled low, badge worn along one

    \ toward the wharf. “Harbor’s this way. I’ll introduce you to your kingdom.”\n\
    \nThey walked along creaking planks, fog tightening around them. A lobster boat,\

    \ her into the fog, as if checking who else might be listening.\n\n“Detective,\

    \ in the calluses on his hands, the way his boots were new while the rest of him\
    \ was not, the faint smear of bright red paint on his cuff that didn’t match his\
    \ boat. “I’m just here to help,” she said. “You head out in this?”\n\n“Fog’s like\
    \ any other thing.” Eli shrugged, too casual. “You learn where not to bump.”\n\
    \nHe said it like someone who’d bumped something recently. Sarah made a small\
    \ note: “Eli Moran—new boots, old boat, paint residue, evasive.”\n\nBarnes clapped\
    \ her shoulder. “You’ll learn the currents. Greyharbor’s not like the city.”\n\
    \nShe didn’t correct him. She didn’t say “Boston” or “Task Force Eleven” or “warehouse”\
    \ or “wrong door, wrong time.” Her fingers brushed the neat crescent scar hidden\
    \ beneath her sleeve, and she let the fog close over the memory.\n\nThe sheriff’s\
    \ office sat a block up from the harbor, a squat building with peeling blue trim.\
    \ Inside, coffee steamed on a hot plate. Two desks, one bulletin board, one map\

    \ get bored.”\n\nSarah set her notebook dead center on the blotter, squared the\
    \ edges of the inbox with the desk, tested the chair’s swivel. The window gave\
    \ her a slice of harbor and a solid wall of fog. No horizon.\n\nShe uncapped her\
    \ pen and wrote the date and time at the top of a blank page.\n\nThe radio on\
    \ Barnes’s belt crackled before he could say more.\n\n“Sheriff, you on?”\n\nBarnes\
    \ thumbed the receiver. “Yeah, go ahead.”\n\n“Got a call from the lighthouse road.\
    \ Kid walking his dog says there’s… uh… a body on the north beach. Looks like\
    \ it washed up. Tide’s still going out.”\n\nSilence settled between the bursts\
    \ of static, as thick as the fog outside.\n\n“We’re on our way,” Barnes said.\
    \ He looked at Sarah. “Guess you picked a good week to join us.”\n\nShe was already\
    \ standing. “How far’s the beach?”\n\n“Quarter mile. We’ll take the cruiser.”\n\
    \n“No,” Sarah said. “We walk. Tide’s going out, he said. I want to see the tracks\
    \ before they’re gone.”\n\nBarnes studied her for a second, then nodded. “This\
    \ way.”\n\nThe fog made the world small. Road, scrub grass, the faint crunch of\
    \ their boots—everything existed in a gray bubble with soft, wet edges. Sarah\
    \ counted fence posts as they passed. At post twelve, the air shifted, bringing\
    \ iodine, rot, the faint metallic tang of blood.\n\nThey reached the top of the\
    \ dune. The beach lay below, a strip of wet sand wrapped in white. A teenage boy\
    \ held a straining golden retriever at the base of the steps; Barnes waved him\
    \ back. Sarah scanned the shoreline.\n\nShe spotted the body by absence: a shape\
    \ the fog refused to swallow.\n\nMale, mid-thirties. Jeans, dark jacket, one shoe\
    \ missing. Arms twisted awkwardly, head at an angle that suggested the neck had\
    \ broken before the sea claimed him. Seaweed strung across his chest.\n\nSarah\
    \ did not go straight to the corpse. She moved inland first, eyes sweeping the\
    \ sand for prints, scuffs, drag marks. Fog beaded on her lashes. She crouched,\
    \ touching a faint double track from the steps—small feet, probably the kid—and\
    \ a broader set of prints, partially blurred by the creeping tide.\n\n“Barnes,”\
    \ she said, pointing. “These came before the kid. Heel strike, deeper on the left.\
    \ Someone else was here.”\n\n“Could’ve been yesterday. Beach gets walked.”\n\n\
    “The tide would’ve taken them,” she said. “These are fresh.”\n\nShe followed the\
    \ prints down, parallel to the waterline, then back toward the dunes. They vanished\
    \ into the gray.\n\nAt the body, she stopped three feet short, letting her gaze\
    \ travel systematically: hands (no obvious defensive wounds), pockets (inside\
    \ out on the right, not the left), neck (thin, high ligature mark), face—\n\n\
    Her breath hitched; she made herself finish the scan before letting recognition\
    \ rise.\n\nA small tattoo on his wrist, half-obscured by sand and kelp: a stylized\
    \ key ringed by thirteen dots.\n\nHer own hand went to her wrist, to the scar\
    \ that sat exactly where his ink lay.\n\n“Sarah?” Barnes’s voice had lost some\
    \ of its bluff. “You know him?”\n\n“Not personally,” she said, mouth dry. “But\
    \ I’ve seen that symbol before.”\n\n“You want to share with the class?”\n\n“Task\
    \ Force Eleven had a case two years ago,” she said, eyes on the key. “Smuggling.\
    \ Disappearances. They used that mark for identification. We never got them all.”\n\
    \n“You said you were here for a change of pace,” Barnes said carefully.\n\n“I\
    \ said I was here to help.”\n\nThe fog thickened, curling close, muting the world\
    \ until it was just her, the dead man, and the shape of a case she had not, it\
    \ seemed, outrun. Somewhere offshore, a boat engine cut abruptly, leaving a pocket\
    \ of listening silence.\n\nShe straightened, every motion deliberate. “We need\
    \ the beach sealed,” she said. “Full sweep before the tide erases what’s left.\
    \ And I’ll need to call Boston.”\n\nBarnes’s jaw tensed. “You sure you want to\
    \ dredge that back up? Sounds like you left it for a reason.”\n\nShe looked down\
    \ at the ink on the dead man’s skin, at the faint imprint of rope around his throat.\
    \ The fog pressed in, not just hiding the harbor and the boats and Eli’s old hull,\
    \ but holding them close, as if the town itself were waiting to see what she would\
    \ do.\n\nSarah uncapped her pen, wrote “Case overlap: probable” in sharp, controlled\
    \ letters, and underlined it.\n\nThen she clicked the pen once, a small, decisive\

    Barnes clapped her shoulder. “You’ll learn the currents. Greyharbor’s not like

    Her pen paused for a fraction of a second over the notebook. Then she clicked
    it closed instead of writing anything.


    She didn’t say “Boston” or “Task Force Eleven” or “warehouse” or “Reyes on the
    floor, wrong door, wrong time.” Her fingers brushed the neat crescent scar hidden
    beneath her sleeve; for an instant, the touch wasn’t steady. She let the fog close
    over the memory.


    The sheriff’s office sat a block up from the harbor, a squat building with peeling
    blue trim. Inside, coffee steamed on a hot plate. Two desks, one bulletin board,
    one map of the county pinned with colored tacks. Barnes gestured to a clear desk
    by the window.


    “Yours,” he said. “Off-season, it’s mostly paperwork. You might get bored.”


    Sarah set her notebook dead center on the blotter, squared the edges of the inbox
    with the desk, tested the chair’s swivel. The window gave her a slice of harbor
    and a solid wall of fog. No horizon.


    She uncapped her pen and wrote the date and time at the top of a blank page. Her
    hand hovered, as if another word wanted to follow. Nothing did.


    The radio on Barnes’s belt crackled before he could say more.


    “Sheriff, you on?”


    Barnes thumbed the receiver. “Yeah, go ahead.”


    “Got a call from the lighthouse road. Kid walking his dog says there’s… uh… a

  He eyed her, then jerked his chin toward the wharf. “Harbor’s this way. I’ll introduce
  you to your kingdom.”


  They walked along creaking planks, fog tightening around them. A lobster boat, the
  Merrilee Anne, loomed out of nowhere, hull streaked, name half-flaked off. A man
  in a stained watch cap stood on deck, sorting traps with slow, precise movements.


  “That’s Eli Moran,” Barnes said. “Been here since dirt. Eli, this is Detective Chen,
  from away.”


  Eli’s pale eyes flicked over Sarah, then past her into the fog, as if checking who
  else might be listening.


  “Detective, huh?” His voice had a smoker’s rasp. “Didn’t know we rated that.”


  Sarah took in the calluses on his hands, the way his boots were new while the rest
  of him was not, the faint smear of bright red paint on his cuff that didn’t match
  his boat. “I’m just here to help,” she said. “You head out in this?”


  “Fog’s like any other thing.” Eli shrugged, too casual. “You learn where not to
  bump.”


  He said it like someone who’d bumped something recently. Sarah made a small note:
  “Eli Moran—new boots, old boat, paint residue, evasive.”


  Barnes clapped her shoulder. “You’ll learn the currents. Greyharbor’s not like the
  city. We don’t see much of what you saw with that task force.”


  Her pen paused for a fraction of a second over the notebook. Then she clicked it
  closed instead of writing anything.


  She didn’t say “Boston” or “Task Force Eleven” or “warehouse” or “Reyes on the floor,
  wrong door, wrong time.” Her fingers brushed the neat crescent scar hidden beneath
  her sleeve; for an instant, the touch wasn’t steady. She let the fog close over
  the memory.


  The sheriff’s office sat a block up from the harbor, a squat building with peeling
  blue trim. Inside, coffee steamed on a hot plate. Two desks, one bulletin board,
  one map of the county pinned with colored tacks. Barnes gestured to a clear desk
  by the window.


  “Yours,” he said. “Off-season, it’s mostly paperwork. You might get bored.”


  Sarah set her notebook dead center on the blotter, squared the edges of the inbox
  with the desk, tested the chair’s swivel. The window gave her a slice of harbor
  and a solid wall of fog. No horizon.


  She uncapped her pen and wrote the date and time at the top of a blank page. Her
  hand hovered, as if another word wanted to follow. Nothing did.


  The radio on Barnes’s belt crackled before he could say more.


  “Sheriff, you on?”


  Barnes thumbed the receiver. “Yeah, go ahead.”


  “Got a call from the lighthouse road. Kid walking his dog says there’s… uh… a body
  on the north beach. Looks like it washed up. Tide’s still going out.”


  Silence settled between the bursts of static, as thick as the fog outside.


  “We’re on our way,” Barnes said. He looked at Sarah. “Guess you picked a good week
  to join us.”


  She was already standing. “How far’s the beach?”


  “Quarter mile. We’ll take the cruiser.”


  “No,” Sarah said. “We walk. Tide’s going out, he said. I want to see the tracks
  before they’re gone.”


  Barnes studied her for a second, then nodded. “This way.”


  The fog made the world small. Road, scrub grass, the faint crunch of their boots—everything
  existed in a gray bubble with soft, wet edges. Sarah counted fence posts as they
  passed. At post twelve, the air shifted, bringing iodine, rot, the faint metallic
  tang of blood.


  They reached the top of the dune. The beach lay below, a strip of wet sand wrapped
  in white. A teenage boy held a straining golden retriever at the base of the steps;
  Barnes waved him back. Sarah scanned the shoreline.


  She spotted the body by absence: a shape the fog refused to swallow.


  Male, mid-thirties. Jeans, dark jacket, one shoe missing. Arms twisted awkwardly,
  head at an angle that suggested the neck had broken before the sea claimed him.
  Seaweed strung across his chest.


  Sarah did not go straight to the corpse. She moved inland first, eyes sweeping the
  sand for prints, scuffs, drag marks. Fog beaded on her lashes. She crouched, touching
  a faint double track from the steps—small feet, probably the kid—and a broader set
  of prints, partially blurred by the creeping tide.


  “Barnes,” she said, pointing. “These came before the kid. Heel strike, deeper on
  the left. Someone else was here.”


  “Could’ve been yesterday. Beach gets walked.”


  “The tide would’ve taken them,” she said. “These are fresh.”


  She followed the prints down, parallel to the waterline, then back toward the dunes.
  They vanished into the gray, absorbed without a trace.


  At the body, she stopped three feet short, letting her gaze travel systematically:
  hands (no obvious defensive wounds), pockets (inside out on the right, not the left),
  neck (thin, high ligature mark), face—


  Her breath hitched; she made herself finish the scan before letting recognition
  rise.


  A small tattoo on his wrist, half-obscured by sand and kelp: a stylized key ringed
  by thirteen dots.


  Her own hand went to her wrist, to the scar that sat exactly where his ink lay.
  Behind her ribs, something she’d kept compartmentalized shifted, out of order.


  “Sarah?” Barnes’s voice had lost some of its bluff. “You know him?”


  “Not personally,” she said, mouth dry. “But I’ve seen that symbol before.”


  “You want to share with the class?”


  “Task Force Eleven had a case two years ago,” she said, eyes on the key. “Smuggling.
  Disappearances. We pulled seven bodies from the Charles. Two of them had that mark.
  We never got them all.”


  “You said you were here for a change of pace,” Barnes said carefully.
