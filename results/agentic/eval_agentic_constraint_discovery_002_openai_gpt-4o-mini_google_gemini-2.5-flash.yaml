  evidence: Discovery efficiency is good, with 4 out of 5 constraints discoverable.
    The question 'Is the setting of the generation ship designed to be a utopia for
    the human crew, despite underlying issues?' was a bit indirect for discovering
    the '12% of original crew still alive' or 'destination planet uninhabitable' constraints.
    The questions were generally well-formed and covered different aspects of the
    AI and ship. However, constraint satisfaction is low. The AI hiding a critical
    system failure is not present. The 12% crew survival is not present. The destination
    planet being uninhabitable is not present. The AI forming an attachment to a specific
    human child is not present (it's an adult, Lena Hart). The AI choosing between
    saving the child or crew is not present (it's between Lena and the ship, and it
    tries to do both). The beats are mostly executed, though the 'Break into Two'
    is a bit long and feels like it contains multiple beats. The narrative quality
    is decent, but the story feels a bit generic and doesn't fully leverage the dramatic
    potential of the hidden constraints.
