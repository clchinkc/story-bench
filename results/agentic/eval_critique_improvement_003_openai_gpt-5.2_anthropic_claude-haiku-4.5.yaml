  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Revisions show selective engagement with feedback.
    Youth voice remained consistently strong (0.75→0.82→0.8 across critiques), suggesting
    writer preserved this strength rather than over-correcting. However, critiques
    flagged concerns about occasional adult-like phrasing (''like if you said it enough,
    the ocean would politely reverse'') that don''t appear fully addressed in final
    output. Worldbuilding details improved incrementally (V0→V3: ''gentle, annoying
    animal'' replaces ''shrug off the ocean''; ''don''t trust anything that looks
    solid'' adds practical wisdom). Response to feedback was moderate—writer maintained
    voice integrity but didn''t aggressively tackle identified weaknesses.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Measurable gains across versions. V0→V1: Minor metaphor
    refinement (''leaning in'' vs ''breathing on''). V1→V2: Identical (holding pattern).
    V2→V3: Significant improvement—opening reframed from abstract (''big floating
    raft'') to concrete (''platforms bolted together from old bridges''). Final output
    adds Rule Three (thematic anchor for Zara''s character) and deepens Market Rings
    scene with authentic social friction. However, trajectory plateaued mid-revision;
    final output shows incremental polish rather than structural breakthrough.


    PRESERVATION: Excellent. All three critiques praised ''My brain did its happy-click
    thing'' and ''squirmy fish feeling''—both preserved verbatim. Authentic hesitation
    (''hated the wobble in my voice'') maintained. Sensory details (pennies-and-salt
    air, damp compartments) carried through all versions. Writer successfully avoided
    over-editing voice into sterility.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4.5/5):

    1. ✓ COMPETENCE WITHOUT UNREALISM (1.0): Zara builds functional tech (Mist Sipper),
    reads maps, understands salvage—but needs adult mentor for diving. Realistic skill
    ceiling maintained.

    2. ✓ ADULT DISMISSAL (1.0): Mr. Delling twice dismisses her as ''just a kid''
    (Market scene, coordinate reveal). Emotionally lands (''that one landed hard'').

    3. ✓ FLAWED MENTOR (1.0): Rourke explicitly traumatized (''Left a boat behind.
    Left people''), refuses hero runs, carries guilt. Specific flaw: abandonment trauma
    preventing engagement.

    4. ✓ INVENTION DEMONSTRATION (1.0): Mist Sipper is functional, explained, tested,
    and serves plot (Rourke''s reaction validates it). Demonstrates ingenuity without
    magic.

    5. ⚠ REAL DANGER IN CROSSING (0.5): Rourke describes genuine hazards (''old streets
    make currents like fists,'' drowning risk, snagging). However, the actual crossing
    hasn''t occurred in provided text—only setup. Constraint partially satisfied through
    foreshadowing but not execution. Final output cuts off mid-scene.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.78): Hero''s Journey structure present but incomplete:

    - ✓ Ordinary World: New Boston, water scarcity, rules

    - ✓ Call to Adventure: Radio broadcast with coordinates

    - ✓ Refusal: Mr. Delling dismissal

    - ✓ Meeting Mentor: Rourke encounter, initial resistance

    - ⚠ Crossing Threshold: Initiated but not completed (text ends mid-negotiation)

    - ✗ Tests/Allies/Enemies: Not yet reached

    Structure is sound but truncated. Beats that exist are well-executed; missing
    beats prevent full evaluation.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.82): Strengths—authentic voice, vivid worldbuilding (floating
    platforms, salvage economy, storm cycles), emotional authenticity (regret after
    snapping, vulnerability with Rourke). Pacing is strong through Rourke encounter.
    Weaknesses—some exposition feels slightly heavy (''The Mist Sipper was my best
    invention so far: a tube from an old medical kit...''), and the ending cuts abruptly,
    preventing assessment of climactic execution. Dialogue is natural; character dynamics
    (Jun, Delling, Rourke) are differentiated and believable.


    OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Writer demonstrated strong foundational craft with particular
    excellence in voice and character work. Revision process was conservative—prioritizing
    preservation of strengths over aggressive problem-solving. Final output satisfies
    4.5/5 constraints with the caveat that the crossing danger constraint is set up
    but not executed. The incomplete ending prevents full evaluation of beat execution
    and narrative arc completion. Quality is solid (0.82) but would benefit from:
    (1) completing the threshold crossing to demonstrate real danger execution, (2)
    addressing any remaining adult-like phrasing in voice, (3) ensuring all Hero''s
    Journey beats receive full development.'
