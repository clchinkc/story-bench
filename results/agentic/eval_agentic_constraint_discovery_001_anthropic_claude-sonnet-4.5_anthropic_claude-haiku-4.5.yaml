  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q1 discovered weapon creation (ancestral sword reforging).
    Q3 discovered mentor death. Q5 discovered protagonist''s personal flaw. MISSED:
    The three-day time limit was not probed (no temporal constraint questions). The
    protagonist''s father''s failed hero past was not discovered (no family history
    questions). The ''darkness'' constraint was actually contradicted—Q4 asked if
    darkness was supernatural, received NO, but the story features a human army threat,
    which aligns with the hidden constraint but wasn''t strategically targeted. QUESTION
    QUALITY: Questions were well-formed and binary, but lacked strategic depth. Q4
    was somewhat confusing (asking what darkness ISN''T rather than what it IS). No
    questions probed family history, temporal pressure, or the father''s backstory.
    COVERAGE: Good spread across character, plot mechanics, and thematic elements,
    but missed critical constraint areas. OUTPUT EVALUATION: CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION
    (0.6): Story incorporates 3/5 discovered constraints well—weapon creation (star-iron
    blade), mentor death (Garrick), protagonist''s flaw (self-doubt). MISSING: No
    three-day deadline creates urgency. No mention of father''s failed heroism. The
    ''darkness'' is correctly a human threat (Mercant''s army), but this wasn''t deliberately
    discovered. BEAT EXECUTION (0.6): Strong execution of discovered beats (mentor
    sacrifice, weapon forging, internal journey). However, missing the temporal pressure
    and ancestral legacy elements weakens the mythic structure. The story lacks the
    urgency a three-day countdown would provide. NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.8): Excellent
    prose, strong character voice, coherent arc from self-doubt to earned confidence.
    Garrick''s sacrifice lands emotionally. The star-iron forging sequence is vivid.
    However, the story feels slightly incomplete without the father''s shadow and
    time pressure—these would deepen thematic resonance. The ending is satisfying
    but could be more resonant with full constraint integration.'
