  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive and specific, with concrete events (03:47
    message, tuning fork gesture, heated gloves moment). All 4 required beats are
    present and well-executed: Call (encrypted signal summons), Refusal (remote sandbox
    attempt, ''no-contact day''), Mentor (Anya''s unconventional silent guidance),
    Threshold (psychological choice to share analysis). Isolation is shown through
    behaviors (declining ride-share, scheduling no-meeting blocks, wearing headphones,
    isolating workstation) rather than exposition. The alien signal is genuinely non-anthropomorphic—hypercube
    tilings, pressure gradients, prime-patterned pulses, topological knots—resisting
    linguistic interpretation. Arjun effectively challenges Yuki''s solitary approach
    throughout. Anya is unconventional (physically limited, communicates through silence/gestures/shared
    work). The genuine human connection moment (heated gloves) surprises Yuki and
    the reader. WEAKNESSES: Constraint satisfaction is 5.5/6 because the ''Threshold
    must be psychological'' constraint is satisfied but somewhat underexplored—the
    threshold crossing happens quickly in the final section without extended internal
    struggle. The metaphor of ''snowstorm of meaning'' is introduced but not fully
    developed through the narrative arc. Narrative pacing accelerates abruptly in
    the final section (facility arrival to warning decryption compresses significantly).
    Some dialogue feels slightly on-the-nose (''Translation isn''t a solo craft'').
    Minor adherence gap: plan mentions Anya ''communicates through silence, gestures,
    and shared work'' but she does speak (''The station is a choir''), which slightly
    contradicts the plan''s emphasis on silence. Output quality is strong but could
    deepen the psychological threshold moment and extend the climactic team-work sequence.'
