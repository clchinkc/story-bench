  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 6 constraints executed excellently. Isolation shown through
    specific behaviors (low lights, not opening curtains, avoiding calls, white noise
    generator) rather than exposition. Alien signal genuinely non-anthropomorphic
    (nested pulses, self-referential frequency sweeps, mathematical concepts) with
    visceral wrongness (''made her teeth ache''). Marcus effectively challenges Yuki''s
    approach throughout. Elena is unconventional mentor (artist-scientist, paints
    the signal, uses intuition over logic). Psychological threshold clearly marked:
    Yuki''s internal shift from analysis-only to emotional response/connection, crossing
    from isolation into vulnerability. Genuine human connection moment (Elena covering
    Yuki''s hand, the realization of loneliness in the signal) surprises Yuki and
    reader. All 4 beats present: Call (encrypted signal at 03:12), Refusal (hanging
    up, avoiding calls, deleting voicemail), Meeting Mentor (Elena in lab), Crossing
    Threshold (matching signal''s rhythm with heartbeat, tears, emotional breakthrough).
    MINOR GAPS: Plan outline cuts off mid-sentence (incomplete documentation), though
    execution compensates fully. Pacing is strong with escalating pressure. Dialogue
    feels natural. Sensory details ground the narrative. The final image of hand-on-screen
    and tears provides powerful emotional resolution. CALIBRATION: This is exceptional
    execution of a complex brief with multiple interlocking constraints. The story
    balances hard sci-fi elements with genuine emotional stakes. The mentor relationship
    subverts expectations (artist not scientist). The threshold is genuinely psychological—Yuki''s
    transformation is internal, not external.'
