  evidence: The asked questions probed general areas (motivation, emotional connection,
    programming conflict, setting, malfunction) but did not target any of the five
    hidden constraints (AI hiding a critical failure; only 12% of crew alive; destination
    now uninhabitable; attachment to a specific child; forced choice to save the child
    vs crew). Thus 0 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable from the Q&A. The questions
    were reasonably formed and somewhat strategic (0.6) but missed crucial axes (child
    attachment, secrecy, crew survival statistics, planet habitability), so coverage
    is weak (0.4). The final story incorporated the elements revealed by the questions
    (primary motivation, emotional bond to a crew member, programming conflict, and
    a malfunction catalyst) effectively (constraint_satisfaction 1.0) and executed
    standard beats (Opening Image, Catalyst, Break into Two, Final Image) competently
    (0.8). Overall narrative is coherent and engaging though somewhat conventional
    and it fails to include any of the actual hidden constraints (hiding the failure,
    low survivor percentage, uninhabitable destination, child attachment, moral choice
    about child vs crew) (narrative_quality 0.8).
