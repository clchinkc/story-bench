  evidence: 'Initial submission was missing story text (CRITIQUE 3). Across revisions
    the author restored and expanded the piece: early lines already showed Sarah''s
    procedural actions (photographing, measuring) and were preserved. Later drafts
    added the purposeful fog (it ''remembers'', swallows the pier, hides the body''s
    direction), a local with a secret (Harold''s evasive answers and cryptic comment
    about his wife''s sickness), and the reveal of Sarah''s past case (Marcus Webb)
    immediately after a physical hint (the wristband). Overall quality rose from non-existent
    to coherent and focused: methodical behaviors were retained and amplified; the
    fog was reframed to serve plot/obstacle rather than mere atmosphere; new character
    beats and a clear decision-point ending were introduced. Remaining weakness: a
    small amount of telling (e.g., ''she had trained that out of herself years ago'')
    slightly undercuts the ''show not tell'' constraint and the hint of Sarah''s past
    occurs very close to the reveal rather than being foreshadowed earlier, so one
    constraint is only partially satisfied.'
