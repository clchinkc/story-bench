  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing all constraints
    and beats with concrete events. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan.
    All six constraints are satisfied: food is symbolic multiple times (kimchi, jjigae,
    mandu, miyeok-guk, tangerines, mother brine), David''s grief is subtly shown through
    his actions (extra chair, soju cap, not stating the rest of his message, the office
    shrine), Mina''s estrangement cause is specific and believable (David staying
    at the restaurant when her mother died), Mr. Alvarez is a regular customer representing
    community and connection, the ending is hopeful but not overly happy (moving to
    California ''for a while'', the key, the mother brine), and Korean cultural elements
    are woven throughout (kimchi, jjigae, mandu, soju, miyeok-guk, jeong, bowing ritual).
    All three beats (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution) are clearly executed. The narrative
    quality is excellent, with strong imagery, emotional depth, and good pacing. The
    language is evocative and the character development, particularly David''s internal
    struggle and Mina''s pain, is well-handled.'
