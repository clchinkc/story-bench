  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on character interiority, specifically
    the tendency to 'tell' rather than 'show' Teddy's emotions and thoughts. While
    the final version still has moments of telling ('This memory, vivid yet distant,
    tugged at him more than the loneliness itself.'), there's a noticeable improvement
    in conveying interiority through action and sensory details. For example, 'His
    heart skipped—a small betrayal' is a good 'show' moment. The introduction of Carla
    and her daughter, and Teddy teaching shoe-tying, effectively 'shows' his re-engagement
    with life and the new path's benefits, rather than just stating it. The story
    also successfully integrates all constraints, particularly the 'new path offers
    something old couldn't' by showing Teddy forming new connections and finding joy
    in unexpected places. The narrative quality is good, with clear prose and a resonant
    ending.
