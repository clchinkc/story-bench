  evidence: 'All six constraints are present: false lead (Gregory Voss / café spiral),
    unconventional profiling (sensory/water-based clues—''check the rain'', smelling
    scenes, artist traces), ticking clock (7-day cycle), betrayal (Detective Vasquez
    arrests him), Midpoint direct confrontation (theater scene with Daniel''s recorded
    message—non-physical confrontation), and Marcus confronts his past failure explicitly
    (Daniel''s death, badge scene, dialogue with Harrington). Required beats are executed:
    Catalyst (news of missing woman), Debate (Naomi/FBI won''t listen; Marcus considers
    going rogue), Break into Two (he breaks into FBI files and goes rogue), Midpoint
    (theater recording confrontation). Narrative is strong in atmosphere and tension,
    with good specifics and pacing; minor issues include a few abrupt transitions
    and a slightly convenient reveal (recording) but overall effective.'
