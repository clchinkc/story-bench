  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer demonstrated strong responsiveness
    to critique feedback. Critique 1 and 2 identified a potential weakness in the
    fifth constraint (ending on decision vs. resolution). The final output directly
    addresses this with the climactic final paragraph: ''The cruiser idled at the
    crossroads...the swirling, decisionless void.'' This is a clear moment of decision,
    not resolution. The writer also preserved all praised elements (methodical action
    sequences, fog as narrative tool) while strengthening the decision-point ending.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Revisions show moderate improvement. Versions 0-3 appear
    nearly identical in the provided text, suggesting the writer may have made subtle
    refinements not visible in the excerpt. However, the final output demonstrates
    significant enhancement: (1) Expanded the Riggs character with ''He had a secret
    in his calmness''—directly addressing the local character secret constraint; (2)
    Added explicit past case hints: ''a case that ended with the hollow finality of
    a gavel and evidence boxes sealed shut'' before the Voss reveal; (3) Strengthened
    the decision moment with the final three paragraphs, creating genuine narrative
    tension. The trajectory shows the writer understood critique points and implemented
    them effectively in the final version.


    PRESERVATION: Excellent preservation of strengths. All praised elements from critiques
    remain intact: step-counting (thirty-seven), grid-mapping, license-plate logging,
    precise movements, fog as active narrative force (''The fog conspired''), sensory
    details (''salt and damp wool''). The opening remains unchanged, indicating confidence
    in foundational work. New material (Voss reveal, Riggs''s secret, decision endpoint)
    integrates seamlessly without disrupting established voice or atmosphere.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5): (1) Methodical nature through action: Extensively
    shown—step counting, notebook logging, grid mapping, precise glove application,
    deliberate boot placement, ''her movements precise.'' (2) Fog serves narrative
    purpose: Functions as concealment (''hiding the body''s arrival''), as investigative
    obstacle (''forcing her to lean inches''), as symbolic accomplice (''active accomplice''),
    and as thematic mirror to Sarah''s emotional fog. (3) Local character secret:
    Riggs has ''a secret in his calmness''—his composure is suspicious, implying knowledge
    or involvement. (4) Past case hinted before reveal: ''a certain city reporter''s
    voice,'' ''water could just be water, not an element of a crime scene,'' ''the
    hollow finality of a gavel'' all precede the Voss identification. (5) Ends on
    decision, not resolution: Final paragraph presents genuine choice—report or investigate—with
    no resolution provided.


    BEAT EXECUTION (3/3 beats): (1) Inciting incident: Body discovery at 10:17 AM,
    establishing the case. (2) Complication/revelation: Voss identification and realization
    of past case failure (''Her failure was complete''). (3) Decision point: Final
    choice between procedural reporting and unauthorized investigation. All beats
    are clearly executed with proper escalation.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong prose with effective tension. Strengths include: precise
    sensory language (''salt and damp wool,'' ''beaded on her jacket''), psychological
    depth (Sarah''s anxiety about the reporter, her need for order), structural sophistication
    (fog as both literal and metaphorical element), and compelling voice. Minor weakness:
    the Riggs character could have more development earlier to make his secret more
    impactful. The final decision moment is genuinely compelling and leaves readers
    invested in Sarah''s choice.'
