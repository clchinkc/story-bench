  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece moves from a sturdy but somewhat schematic
    sketch to a more textured, interior, and consequential scene. V0 establishes the
    ritual but leans on summary. V1 adds rhythmic sensory details (paper thwack, trash
    scent) and tightens the routine. V2 and V3 deepen interiority (the barista longing,
    rehearsed line, breast-pocket gesture), introduce the disruptive trench earlier,
    and crucially add Sarah and the planting sequence that concretely reveals what
    Teddy has been avoiding. Strengths (specific routine detail, evocative sensory
    work) are preserved and amplified; weaknesses addressed include earlier vagueness
    about Teddy’s inner life. Remaining issues: the Story Circle''s later beats (return/change)
    are compressed—Teddy''s change is implied rather than fully shown—and there are
    a few slightly explicit lines of exposition (''To speak to a stranger was to admit
    he was solo'') that reduce subtlety. Overall, the revisions substantively improved
    specificity, emotional texture, and constraint fulfillment.'
