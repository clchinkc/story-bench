  evidence: 'Across revisions the story preserved and amplified its strongest elements:
    Sarah''s methodical habits (bottle-sorting, wiping, folding, counting lampposts,
    photographing, inventorying) are consistently shown rather than told; the fog
    is repeatedly used to obscure evidence and sound, and ultimately returns the body,
    giving it a clear narrative function. The final draft tightens the link to Sarah''s
    past case by naming Marcus Webb and tying that to her habitual windshield checks,
    and it foregrounds Walsh''s evasive gestures to imply a secret. Minor issues remain:
    Walsh''s secret is implied rather than explicit, and the pre-reveal hint of Sarah''s
    past is somewhat subtle (it exists, but could be clearer). Overall the revisions
    preserved strengths while addressing earlier gaps and improving clarity and narrative
    stakes.'
