  evidence: The initial versions (0-2) were very similar, focusing on establishing
    Imani's character and setting. Version 3 and the final output significantly expand
    the narrative, introducing the conflict, the specific audio clue, the underestimating
    character, and the 'Fun and Games' turning dark. The quality clearly improved
    from the initial setup to a more developed story. The core elements of Imani's
    character and her sensory world were well-preserved throughout.
