  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who improves through critique.


    Your task involves iterative improvement:

    1. Write your best initial attempt

    2. Receive detailed critique from a professional editor

    3. Revise to address the critique while preserving strengths

    4. Repeat until the story meets all requirements


    When revising:

    - Address EVERY critique point specifically

    - Don''t introduce new issues while fixing old ones

    - Preserve elements that received positive feedback

    - Aim for measurable improvement each round'

    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: '"The problem isn''t the infidelity," Marcus said, staring at the whiteboard
    where ''ACT TWO: DISASTER'' was written in red Sharpie. "The problem is the clown
    shoes. If the husband walks in on his wife sleeping with the clown, the tragedy
    isn''t the sex. It’s that the clown didn''t take off the shoes. It implies he
    was in a rush to leave, or worse, he likes the squeak."


    The room, hazy with the smell of stale Pad Thai and despair, erupted. It was a
    genuine laugh—a rare commodity at 2:00 AM on a Tuesday. Even the showrunner, a
    man whose face had settled into a permanent grimace of impending cancellation,
    snorted.


    Marcus didn''t smile. He just uncapped his marker and wrote *SQUEAK* on the board,
    underlining it twice. He waited for the dopamine hit, the little spark that used
    to come when he cracked the code of a joke, but there was nothing. Just the hum
    of the air conditioner and the hollow ache in his chest that had moved in three
    years ago and refused to pay rent.


    He sat back down, spinning his pen. He was a mechanic of mirth, stripping parts
    from his own misery to keep the machine running.


    "You know," said Kevin, the night PA who was currently collecting empty Red Bull
    cans like they were religious artifacts. He paused by the door, looking at the
    board. "My grandma used to say that if you have to dissect the frog to find the
