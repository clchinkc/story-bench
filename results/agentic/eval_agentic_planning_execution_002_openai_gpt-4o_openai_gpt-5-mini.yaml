  evidence: 'Strengths: The story shows Yuki''s isolation through concrete behaviors
    (ordering meals, ignoring video pings, talking to an AI), includes an unconventional
    mentor (Emmett), a colleague who challenges her (Anna), frames the plane journey
    as a psychological Threshold, and contains a surprising moment of genuine human
    connection (Anna sharing her isolation). Weaknesses: The plan was somewhat truncated
    and did not explicitly plan how to render the signal as genuinely alien. The final
    output anthropomorphizes the alien signal (emotional/multi-sensory ''understanding''
    and a human-style warning), which fails the ''genuinely alien'' constraint. Narrative
    is serviceable but leans toward exposition in places (the decoding and cosmic-warning
    reveal) rather than fully realized, suspenseful discovery.'
