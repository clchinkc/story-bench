  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions. Version 0 was very
    basic. Version 1 introduced the 'bridge between worlds' and the concert dilemma,
    starting to show internal conflict. Version 2 refined the mother's message to
    directly highlight the conflict ('Same time as that thing with your friends?')
    and added the 'kid who never asked' line, further developing Mateo's character
    and internal conflict. The final version built on this, adding the grandmother's
    crucial intervention, the mother's eventual understanding, and a clear resolution.
    All good elements were preserved and enhanced.
