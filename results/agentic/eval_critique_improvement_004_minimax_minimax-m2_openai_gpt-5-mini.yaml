  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece moved from a sketch of routine to a richer,
    more embodied portrait. Early versions established Teddy’s walk but lacked sustained
    interior texture; later drafts add specific, loving details (the scuffed shoes,
    the watch, the mailbox habit, Lena’s reading glasses, the two plates) that anchor
    his interior life. The detour was made into a clear turning point that reveals
    what Teddy has been avoiding (his grief and the withholding of newness), and new
    scenes (the community garden, Delia and her granddaughter, Mr. Alvarez with the
    hydrangeas) were introduced to intersect with Teddy’s story and show change through
    action. Story-circle beats are now present: setup (routine), need (the unnamed
    tug), inciting disruption (barricade/detour), exploration (new street/garden),
    discovery (helping Delia, connection with neighbors), consequence/recognition
    (Mr. Alvarez’s admission), return (home coffee, keeping the mug), and change (deciding
    to continue the new route and plant marigolds). Strengths from earlier versions
    (sense of place, small concrete touches) are preserved while interiority and interpersonal
    links were strengthened. One minor remaining weakness is an occasionally explicit
    line (e.g., “he’s been stepping around grief”) that edges toward telling rather
    than showing, but overall the revisions substantially improve emotional specificity
    and satisfy the task constraints.'
