  evidence: Initial critiques flagged thin interiority and asked for more showing
    rather than telling. The final draft responds by expanding scenes across multiple
    days, adding concrete sensory beats (the mailbox latch at 6:17, the steaming manhole,
    the cinnamon-roll smell), repeated behavioral hesitations, and embodied metaphors
    (stomach knot, stone in his shoe, internal commands like “Just pass by”), which
    strengthen Teddy’s interior life. Revisions visible (V0–V3) showed little change
    in the opener, but the final output adds the detour arc, Maria’s stand, and the
    repeated resistances that realize the Story Circle beats. Some explicit summaries
    remain (e.g., “He thought of June not as absence, but as the warmth…”), so interiority
    and subtlety improved but are not fully maximized.
