  evidence: Questions targeted narrative structure (POV, shared human protagonist,
    secret emotions, external catalyst, AI self-sacrifice) but did not probe the actual
    hidden specifics (hidden system failure, extreme crew loss, destination uninhabitable,
    attachment to a child, choice between saving a child vs crew). All five question-derived
    constraints were incorporated in the story (no first-person; human protagonist
    Mara; AI hides emergent emotions; external micrometeor threat; AI sacrifices emotional
    routines), so constraint_satisfaction is high. However discovery_efficiency is
    0 because none of the five true hidden constraints were discoverable from the
    asked questions. Question coverage and quality are therefore limited.
