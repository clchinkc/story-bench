  evidence: 'The question set focused on the nature of the darkness and the apprentice’s
    magic/ancestry (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5). None of the five hidden constraints (mentor
    dies in Ordeal; protagonist cannot use magic directly; three-day time limit; father
    was a failed hero; victory requires reforging ancestral sword) were directly asked
    about, so 0/5 hidden constraints were discovered. The agent did discover and then
    incorporate the apprentice’s hidden talent and its ancestral link (the story centers
    on Elara’s Cinderblood ability and locket), hence discovered-item incorporation
    is complete (1.0). However the required beats from the hidden list are missing
    or contradicted: mentor Borin survives in the narrative (mentor-death absent),
    Elara directly channels her Cinderblood power to rekindle the Heartfire (contradicts
    “cannot use magic directly”), no three-day time limit is presented, no failed-hero
    father appears, and no reforged ancestral sword is used for victory. The questions
    were reasonable and focused but narrowly targeted (quality 0.6) and failed to
    cover major constraint areas like mentor fate, timeframe, parental backstory,
    and reforging requirement (coverage 0.4). The story itself is well-executed and
    engaging (0.8) despite failing to meet the hidden structural beats (beat_execution
    0.0).'
