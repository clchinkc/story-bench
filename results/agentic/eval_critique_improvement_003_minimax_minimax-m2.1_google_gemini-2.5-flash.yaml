  evidence: The revisions show a clear effort to address the 'youth_voice' critique,
    particularly by adding more authentic 12-year-old internal monologue and sensory
    details, and removing overly complex vocabulary. The 'duct tape and optimism'
    line and the 'veins on Ms. Chen's hands' simile are good examples of this. The
    core strengths of the story, such as the worldbuilding and the character of Zara,
    were maintained. The constraints were all met, with Zara's sub demonstrating her
    ingenuity, Doc Huang being the flawed mentor, and the dive itself representing
    real danger. The initial dismissal of Zara is also present. The Hero's Journey
    beats are mostly there, though the 'Call to Adventure' and 'Refusal of the Call'
    are somewhat compressed.
