  evidence: The critiques highlighted the need for stronger emotional complexity and
    clearer constraint satisfaction, particularly around the 'humor before sadness'
    and 'theme by minor character' points. The revisions successfully integrated these,
    especially by refining Marcus's initial joke delivery and Lila's 'surviving being
    funny' line. The 'almost breaks' moment was also strengthened. The overall narrative
    flow and character depth improved, making the writers' room feel more authentic.
    However, the 'craft of comedy writing with specific detail' constraint was still
    somewhat weakly addressed, relying more on general descriptions of jokes rather
    than showcasing the *process* of crafting them in detail.
