    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.

    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

  content: "**YOUR PLAN:**\n\n**Story Title:** The Last Fermentation\n**Protagonist:**\
    \ David Park (50), Chef/Owner of \"Park’s Garden.\"\n**Setting:** Chicago, \"\
    Park’s Garden\" kitchen and dining room. The rumble of construction is audible.\n\
    \n**Beat-by-Beat Outline:**\n\n*   **Act 1: The Stagnant Pot (Setup)**\n    *\
    \   **Event:** David is prepping for the final week. The rhythm is mechanical.\
    \ He ignores the demolition notice on the counter.\n    *   **Constraint (Regular\
    \ Customer):** Mr. Henderson (80s) arrives for his Tuesday lunch. He represents\
    \ the neighborhood's history and David’s fear of obsolescence.\n    *   **Constraint\
    \ (Implicit Grief):** David sets a small bowl of rice on the back counter where\
    \ his wife, Mi-Sun, used to take her breaks. He doesn't speak to it; he just places\
    \ it there out of habit.\n    *   **Inciting Incident:** His daughter, Hannah\
    \ (26), arrives from California with packing tape, not an appetite. She pushes\
    \ the brochure for a condo in San Diego.\n\n*   **Act 2: Boiling Over (The Confrontation)**\n\
    \    *   **Scene:** Late night, Day 4. The kitchen is hot.\n    *   **Symbolic\
    \ Food #1 (Doenjang-jjigae):** David is boiling a pungent soybean stew. It represents\
    \ the \"stink\" of history and hard work that Hannah wants to escape, but David\
    \ finds comforting.\n    *   **The Conflict:** Hannah tries to pack Mi-Sun’s old\
    \ ledger. David snaps, refusing to let it go.\n    *   **Constraint (Estrangement\
    \ Cause):** Hannah reveals she isn't trying to erase her mother; she’s trying\
    \ to save David. She admits she left for California because after the funeral,\
    \ David became a \"ghost\" in the kitchen, ignoring her to focus on the restaurant.\n\
    \    *   **Midpoint Decision:** David realizes fighting the city (the highway)\
    \ is actually just him fighting the reality of his wife's death. The building\
    \ isn't the wife.\n\n*   **Act 3: The Release (Resolution)**\n    *   **Scene:**\
    \ The final hour, Day 7. The restaurant is empty.\n    *   **Cultural Element:**\
    \ David performs a quiet, informal rite. He pours a shot of Soju onto the threshold\
    \ of the back door before locking it, bowing once to the empty room (respect to\
    \ the spirit of the place).\n    *   **Symbolic Food #2 (Kimchi):** David hands\
    \ Hannah a heavy jar of 3-year-old Mookeunji (aged Kimchi). He tells her it \"\
    tastes better after it sits in the dark for a long time.\" A metaphor for his\
    \ grief and their relationship—it needed time to mature, not fresh ingredients.\n\
    \    *   **Ending:** David does not move to California yet, but he hands over\
    \ the keys to the foreman. He tells Hannah he will visit her in a month. He steps\
    \ onto the sidewalk, looking at the sky, not the building.\n\n---\n\n**STORY EXECUTION:**\n\
    \nThe vibration of the jackhammers three blocks over rattled the stainless steel\
    \ prep table, creating a rhythmic tremor in the surface of David’s water glass.\
    \ It was the heartbeat of the highway expansion, getting louder every day. David\
    \ Park ignored it, focusing instead on the garlic cloves under his knife. Smash,\
    \ peel, mince. Smash, peel, mince.\n\n\"Same time next week, Dave?\"\n\nDavid\
    \ looked up. Mr. Henderson was standing by the register, counting out crumpled\
    \ singles. The man was eighty-two, wearing the same tweed cap he’d worn since\
    \ the Clinton administration.\n\n\"We close on Friday, Mr. Henderson,\" David\
    \ said gently. \"Remember? The highway.\"\n\n\"Right, right. Progress,\" the old\
    \ man grunted, looking confused. \"Well. Shame. The Galbi was good today.\"\n\n\
    Mr. Henderson shuffled out, the bell above the door chiming a hollow note. He\
    \ represented the last of the old guard, the neighborhood that existed before\
    \ the gentrification and the interstate lanes. When the door swung shut, David’s\
    \ eyes drifted to the high stool in the corner of the kitchen. It was empty, but\
    \ a faded floral apron still hung on the back hook. He silently plated a small\
    \ bowl of white rice and placed it on the stool’s seat, just as he had done every\
    \ lunch shift for the last four years.\n\n\"Dad, you can’t keep feeding the furniture.\"\
    \n\nDavid stiffened. Hannah stood in the doorway, a California tan clashing with\
    \ the dim, fluorescent lighting of the Chicago winter. She held a roll of packing\
    \ tape like a weapon.\n\n\"It’s for the ancestors,\" David muttered, turning back\
    \ to the stove.\n\n\"Mom isn't an ancestor, Dad. She’s gone. And this building\
    \ is going to be rubble in seventy-two hours. Please, look at the San Diego brochure\
    \ again.\"\n\n\"I have customers to feed,\" David deflected, though the dining\
    \ room was empty.\n\nBy Wednesday evening, the kitchen was a war zone of cardboard\
    \ boxes. The air was thick with the smell of *Doenjang-jjigae*. The fermented\
    \ soybean stew bubbled violently in the stone pot, releasing a pungent, earthy\
    \ aroma—the smell of deep roots and decay. To David, it smelled like home; to\
    \ Hannah, it seemed to smell like suffocation.\n\nShe was trying to pack the stack\
    \ of grease-stained ledgers from 1999.\n\n\"Leave those,\" David snapped, grabbing\
    \ her wrist. \"She wrote the specials in the margins.\"\n\n\"Dad, it’s trash!\
    \ It’s all trash!\" Hannah pulled away, her voice cracking. \"You want to stay\
    \ here and fight a bulldozer? For what? You think if you keep the stove on, she’ll\
    \ come back through that door?\"\n\n\"I built this for you,\" David said, his\
    \ voice low.\n\n\"No,\" Hannah countered, the tears finally spilling. \"You built\
    \ it for us, but you hid in it for yourself. When Mom died, you didn't hug me,\
    \ Dad. You sharpened knives. You prepped radish. I moved to California because\
    \ I was already living alone in this house.\"\n\nThe stew boiled over, hissing\
    \ as the foam hit the burner. David stared at the mess. The scorching liquid turned\
    \ black on the iron grate. He realized then that the bitterness in the air wasn't\
    \ the soybeans. It was the silence he had maintained for four years. The building\
    \ wasn't a shrine; it was a fortress he had built to keep the pain out, which\
    \ had successfully kept his daughter out too.\n\nFriday came with a gray sky.\
    \ The movers had taken the heavy equipment. The dining room echoed.\n\nDavid stood\
    \ by the back door. He held a bottle of Soju. He poured a single shot into a glass,\
    \ then poured the liquid onto the concrete threshold. He capped the bottle and\
    \ bowed deeply to the empty kitchen—a bow of gratitude and dismissal.\n\nHannah\
    \ was waiting by the rental car, shivering in the wind. She watched him lock the\
    \ heavy steel door for the last time. He walked over, carrying a heavy, earthenware\
    \ jar.\n\n\"What is this?\" she asked.\n\n\"Mookeunji,\" David said. \"Three-year-old\
    \ Kimchi. I buried the jar in the back"
