  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Only 2 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q1 correctly identified blacksmithing as primary
    method (YES). Q4 correctly identified artifact reforging (YES). However, Q2 asked
    about ''literal darkness'' and received NO, which was misleading—the darkness
    IS literal (tyranny/winter) but the question framed it poorly. Q3 and Q5 received
    NO answers but didn''t probe the actual constraints: mentor death, three-day limit,
    father''s failed heroism, and the antagonist relationship. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions
    were reasonably well-formed but lacked strategic depth. Q2 was ambiguous (conflating
    physical manifestation with metaphorical meaning). Questions didn''t probe temporal
    constraints, family history, or mentor fate. COVERAGE: Questions touched story
    mechanics (blacksmithing, artifact) but missed character relationships, time pressure,
    and backstory elements. OUTPUT EVALUATION: The narrative incorporates discovered
    constraints well—blacksmithing is central, artifact reforging is the Ordeal. However,
    CRITICAL FAILURES on hidden constraints: (1) Mentor Thorne does NOT die—he remains
    in the village; (2) No three-day time limit is established or referenced; (3)
    Father''s failed heroism is completely absent; (4) Antagonist Malcor is not a
    mentor/family member (correctly avoided). BEAT EXECUTION: Call to Adventure, Crossing
    Threshold, Ordeal, and Resolution are all present and well-structured. However,
    the Ordeal lacks the mentor''s death, which should be a climactic sacrifice. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: The story is well-written, thematically coherent, and emotionally resonant.
    The metaphor of restoration as resistance is elegant. Prose is strong and character
    voice is clear. The bloodless revolution is satisfying but undermines the stakes
    that a three-day limit and mentor death would provide.'
