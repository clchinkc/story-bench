  evidence: The revisions successfully incorporated the feedback, particularly regarding
    the emotional complexity and the specific constraints. The initial versions were
    very similar, but the final version clearly shows the integration of the critique
    points. The humor-first, pathos-later structure was well-executed, and the minor
    character (Leonard) delivered the theme. Maya's character was developed to be
    perceptive, and Marcus's near-break moment was subtly handled. The craft of comedy
    writing was evident in the descriptions of joke structures and the 'World's Boss'
    joke itself. The overall narrative quality improved significantly from the initial
    drafts to the final output, demonstrating a strong improvement trajectory.
