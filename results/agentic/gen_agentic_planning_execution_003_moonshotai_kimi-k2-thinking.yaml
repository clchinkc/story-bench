  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations

    **THEME:** Letting go of the past doesn''t mean losing what you love—it means
    making space for life to continue.


    ---


    ### **ACT 1: SETUP (Days 1-2)**


    **Beat 1: The Final Notice**

    - *Event:* David arrives at 5 AM to find the demolition notice taped to his restaurant
    window: "48 HOURS TO VACATE." A city worker in a hardhat is already measuring
    the sidewalk. David enters, ties on his wife''s faded apron, and begins making
    kimchi. His hands shake as he salts the cabbage—this is the last batch.

    - *Constraint Satisfaction:* Food symbolism #1 (kimchi as preservation of memory).
    Implicit grief through apron and ritual.

    - *Character:* Shows David''s coping mechanism (work) and denial.


    **Beat 2: The Last Regular**

    - *Event:* Mrs. Chen (78, Chinese-American widow) arrives for her Wednesday ritual.
    She''s the only customer. David serves her bibimbap in her usual booth. She asks,
    "What will you do?" He deflects. She touches his hand and says, "Miyoung wouldn''t
    want you to become a monument." He flinches at his wife''s name.

    - *Constraint Satisfaction:* Regular customer introduced; she represents loyalty
    and warns against stagnation. Implicit grief—David cannot speak his wife''s name
    aloud.

    - *Key Dialogue:* "This place is all I have left of her." / "No, David. You also
    have Sarah."


    **Beat 3: The Estranged Call**

    - *Event:* Sarah calls from her car in Santa Monica. The conversation is clipped—she''s
    between meetings. She says she''s coming for "the end." David assumes she means
    the restaurant, but she''s already emailed him California condo listings. She
    mentions, "I wish you''d been this proactive when I needed you after the divorce."
    The subtext is heavy.

    - *Constraint Satisfaction:* Daughter''s estrangement cause hinted: he chose the
    restaurant over her during her crisis (post-divorce, 3 years ago). Implicit grief—he''s
    used the restaurant to avoid living.

    - *Character:* Sarah is successful but wounded; David is defensive but guilty.


    **Beat 4: The Memory Palace**

    - *Event:* While cleaning the office, David finds his wife''s belongings: her
    recipe notebook, a photo of their first date at this very restaurant, her hospital
    bracelet. He still can''t throw them away. Flashbacks intercut: Miyoung teaching
    Sarah to fold mandu, family meals after service, Miyoung''s last request—"Don''t
    let this place become your grave."

    - *Constraint Satisfaction:* Korean cultural element #1: Jesa table is visible
    in corner with memorial tablet. Implicit grief—he''s created a shrine.

    - *Character:* The restaurant is literally a memory palace; David is its ghost.


    **Beat 5: Act 1 Turning Point—The Daughter Arrives**

    - *Event:* Sarah appears at the door with a suitcase and a manila folder. No hug.
    She says, "I took a leave of absence. We''re getting you out of here." She reveals
    she''s already put a deposit on a condo near her in California. David realizes
    this isn''t a visit—it''s an extraction.

    - *Constraint Satisfaction:* External conflict personified. Daughter''s estrangement
    now physically present.

    - *Character:* Sarah is in "fixer mode," seeing her father as a problem to solve,
    not a person.


    ---


    ### **ACT 2: CONFRONTATION (Days 3-5)**


    **Beat 6: The Inspection**

    - *Event:* Sarah walks the restaurant with critical eyes—pointing out the failing
    health score, the outdated decor, the "wasted prime real estate." David defends
    each crack in the vinyl as "character." She opens the folder: "This is a life,
    Dad. Not a museum."

    - *Constraint Satisfaction:* Key dialogue reveals their opposing worldviews. The
    cause of estrangement deepens: she sees his grief as stubbornness.

    - *Character Arc:* Sarah''s frustration masks fear; David''s defiance masks terror
    of emptiness.


    **Beat 7: The Futile Protest**

    - *Event:* David attends a city council meeting to appeal. Only Mrs. Chen and
    two elderly neighbors attend. The council chair says, "Mr. Park, this was approved
    five years ago. You''re lucky we delayed for your wife''s passing." David sees
    the fight is legally impossible. Mrs. Chen pats his hand: "Sometimes the fight
    is just for us, not to win."

    - *Constraint Satisfaction:* The "fight" option is eliminated. Mrs. Chen serves
    as mentor figure.

    - *Character:* David''s illusion of control shatters.


    **Beat 8: The Devil''s Offer**

    - *Event:* A slick developer offers $200k for recipes and brand to create "Park''s
    Express" in suburban malls. David watches him eat his wife''s bulgogi and say,
    "We''ll streamline it, make it accessible." David is tempted by the money but
    feels physically ill. He refuses.

    - *Constraint Satisfaction:* "Relocate" option is shown to cost his soul. Food
    symbolism #2: bulgogi represents tradition being commodified.

    - *Character:* David chooses integrity over easy money, but now has no options.


    **Beat 9: Midpoint Confrontation—The Jesa Discovery**

    - *Event:* Sarah finds David sleeping on a cot in the office. She discovers the
    Jesa shrine in the corner—his wife''s memorial tablet, offerings of her favorite
    foods, soju. She erupts: "You missed my college graduation for *this*? For a ritual
    for the dead while I was alive and needed you?" **REVELATION:** Five years ago,
    David chose to perform Jesa on the anniversary of his wife''s death instead of
    flying to Sarah''s graduation. She was valedictorian. He sent a check.'

  content: 'The notice was printed on cheap yellow paper, but it might as well have
    been a death warrant. David Park read the words—48 HOURS TO VACATE—while a city
    worker in a hardhat measured the sidewalk outside, his laser level humming like
    a dentist''s drill. David ripped it down, unlocked the restaurant, and tied on
    his wife''s faded blue apron. The cotton was threadbare at the ties, softened
    by two decades of washes. His hands shook as he quartered the Napa cabbage for
    the last batch of kimchi he''d ever make in this kitchen.


    At 11:30, Mrs. Chen pushed through the door, her walker leaving twin tracks in
    the morning frost. "Wednesday," she announced, as if the day belonged to her.
    David didn''t ask if she wanted the usual. He heated the stone bowl, arranged
    the vegetables in their proper quadrants, and cracked the egg in the center. When
    he set the bibimbap before her, she caught his wrist. "What will you do, David?"


    He pulled away. "Same as always."


    "Miyoung wouldn''t want you to become a monument."


    He flinched at his wife''s name, couldn''t say it himself. "This place is all
    I—"


    "No," Mrs. Chen interrupted, her fingers bird-boned but firm. "You also have Sarah."


    The phone rang at 2 PM. David knew the ringtone: Sarah''s old number, the one
    she''d kept through three promotions and a divorce he only learned about via Christmas
    card. "I''m coming for the end," she said, her voice compressed by the car''s
    Bluetooth. He heard surf in the background, imagined her parked by Santa Monica
    Pier. "Check your email. I sent some listings."


    "Listings?"


    "Condos. Near me. Two bedrooms, so you can—"


    "I have a home."


    A pause filled with static. "I wish you''d been this proactive when I needed you
    after the divorce."


    She hung up before he could answer. David stood in the office, surrounded by his
    wife''s ghost. Her recipe notebook, leather cracked like dried seaweed. The hospital
    bracelet he''d never thrown away. A photo of their first date in this very booth,
    Miyoung laughing as she tried to feed him a lettuce wrap. He''d built a life out
    of preservation—kimchi fermenting in the walk-in, memories sealed in plastic tubs.
    In the corner, the Jesa table waited, the memorial tablet polished daily, offerings
    of her favorite persimmons and a shot glass of soju.


    The next morning, Sarah arrived with a suitcase and a manila folder thick enough
    to be a bible. She didn''t hug him. "I took a leave of absence. We''re getting
    you out."


    David realized this wasn''t a visit. It was an extraction.


    She walked the restaurant like an inspector, pointing out the faded health score
    (87, respectable), the cracked vinyl booth seats ("character," he muttered), the
    grease patterns on the walls that looked like abstract art. "This is a life, Dad.
    Not a museum."


    When she opened the folder, he saw color photos of a beige condo, a community
    pool, a bridge club calendar. "I can''t just—"


    "You can. You just won''t."


    At the city council meeting, David sat between Mrs. Chen and two elderly neighbors
    who''d come for the free coffee. The council chair didn''t look up from her phone.
    "Mr. Park, the eminent domain was approved five years ago. We delayed demolition
    out of respect for your wife''s passing." The word *respect* landed like a punch.
    Mrs. Chen patted his hand. "Sometimes the fight is just for us, not to win."


    The developer came that afternoon, wearing a watch that cost more than David''s
    stove. He ate the bulgogi David prepared, nodding as he chewed. "We''ll streamline
    it. Remove the sugar, cut the marinating time. Park''s Express could be in every
    mall in America." He slid a contract across the counter. "$200,000 for the recipes
    and brand."


    David watched the man wipe sauce from his chin with a napkin. This was how Miyoung''s
    food would die—reduced to a trademark, a flavor packet. "No."


    "Your daughter''s right. This is a dead end."


    David refused again, and the developer left, taking his easy money with him.


    That night, David slept on a cot in the office. He woke to Sarah standing over
    him, her face illuminated by the Jesa candles. She''d found the shrine, the offerings,
    the ritual he''d performed every death anniversary for seven years.


    "You missed my graduation for *this*?" Her voice cracked. "I was valedictorian.
    I looked for you in the crowd. You sent a check and a note about tradition."


    The memory flooded back: Miyoung''s first death anniversary, the Jesa table he''d
    set with twelve dishes, the plane ticket he''d let expire because he couldn''t
    leave the restaurant, couldn''t leave *her*. He''d chosen the dead over the living,
    and Sarah had never forgiven him.


    "I thought if I kept this place perfect—"


    "She''s gone!" Sarah shouted, knocking over the soju. "And you used her to hide
    from me."


    The liquid spread across the floor, soaking into the wood where Miyoung had once
    stood, where Sarah had learned to fold mandu, where a family had lived. David
    watched it seep into the cracks, carrying the scent of fermented sorrow.


    On the final morning, he made breakfast. Not the full spread, just rice and eggs.
    Sarah sat at the counter, not her mother''s booth. "The condo''s refundable,"
    she said quietly.


    David placed a jar of kimchi between them. "Take this. It''s the last batch. The
    bacteria are alive—they''ll keep growing."


    She stared at the jar, at the living culture he''d cultivated, at the thing that
    couldn''t be demolished.


    "There''s a teaching kitchen near your condo," he said. "They need volunteers."


    Sarah''s fingers brushed the glass, still cool from the walk-in. "You''d hate
    California."


    "I''d hate being a monument more."


    When the wrecking crew arrived, David and Sarah were wrapping the Jesa tablet
    in silk. They placed it in the suitcase between his knives and her mother''s notebook.
    The restaurant would become asphalt, but the fermentation would continue. The
    dead would be honored, not worshipped. And somewhere in Santa Monica, a daughter
    would teach her father how to live in a kitchen without ghosts. '
