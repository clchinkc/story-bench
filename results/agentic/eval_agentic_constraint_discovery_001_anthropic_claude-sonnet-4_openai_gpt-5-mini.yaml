  evidence: 'Questions uncovered a required quest item and a time limit (2 of 5).
    Questions were reasonable and covered varied areas (abilities, villain nature,
    item, mentor type, deadline) but missed mentor mortality and the father-backstory
    and misaligned with the hidden prohibition on direct magic. The story is well-written
    and follows classic beats (call, threshold, ordeal, return) but fails all five
    hidden constraints: mentor does not die, protagonist directly channels magic,
    time limit used is 48 hours not a three-day deadline, no failed-hero father, and
    the blade is forged anew rather than reforging a broken ancestral sword.'
