  evidence: All five hidden constraints were never targeted by the five questions
    (no questions about system failures, crew survival percentage, destination habitability,
    attachment to a child, or a child-vs-crew moral dilemma), so none were discoverable
    (0/5). The questions were generic and misdirected (low quality), though they spanned
    varied topics (embodiment, directives, emotions, cryo, decommissioning) rather
    than the actual hidden constraints. The submitted story executes narrative beats
    strongly (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two are present
    and well-written) but incorporates none of the hidden constraints (no secret system
    failure, no ~12% survivor detail, destination still viable, no attachment to a
    specific child, no child-vs-crew choice).
error: null
