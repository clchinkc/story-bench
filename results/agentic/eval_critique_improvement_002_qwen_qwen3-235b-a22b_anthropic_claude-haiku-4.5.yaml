  evidence: 'VERSION 0 established the core humor-to-pathos structure (stick-figure
    toaster joke) but lacked specificity and character depth. CRITIQUE 1 identified
    strong emotional complexity (0.78) but noted incomplete execution. CRITIQUE 2-3
    flagged missing story text, prompting fuller narrative development. FINAL OUTPUT
    demonstrates marked improvement: (1) CONSTRAINT 1 (laugh before sadness): Achieved
    through pie-chart-to-frown visual gag and ''tonal whiplash'' approval before Marcus''s
    marker-smudge-into-scream reveals vulnerability. (2) CONSTRAINT 2 (theme by minor
    character): Darryl delivers ''Jokes are just lies we tell to survive the truth''—perfectly
    positioned, not Marcus. (3) CONSTRAINT 3 (comedy craft specificity): ''Runner
    structure'' explanation with three-box methodology, ''z-axis inversion,'' ''network
    calls it emotional tourism''—demonstrates insider knowledge. (4) CONSTRAINT 4
    (new writer sees through Marcus): Zoe''s ''You''re terrified they''ll see you
    behind the jokes'' and ''You write to bury yours alive'' show penetrating insight;
    she''s not naive. (5) CONSTRAINT 5 (Marcus almost breaks): Lunch scene—fake laugh,
    ''I''m elegant at this'' pratfall, then table-slap deflection. The cursor-hover
    moment (''mannequin'' deletion) adds silent vulnerability. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening
    Image (pie chart), Theme Stated (Darryl), Catalyst (Zoe''s entrance), Craft demonstration,
    Almost-Break moment, Industry Authenticity (Darryl''s observation, script revisions),
    Character Depth (final exchange). All beats present and functional. PRESERVATION:
    Original stick-figure humor DNA maintained while adding Zoe''s complexity and
    Marcus''s fractured interior. The revision trajectory shows responsiveness to
    critique feedback by deepening character motivation and adding the ''almost breaks''
    beat with greater specificity. Minor weakness: final line trails incomplete (''Touché''),
    suggesting rushed ending rather than full resolution.'
