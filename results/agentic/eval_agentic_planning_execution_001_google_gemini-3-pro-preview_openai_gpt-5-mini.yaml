  evidence: 'The submitted plan explicitly covers all required beats and constraints:
    false lead (warehouse/mannequin), unconventional technique ("Auditory Empathy"),
    ticking clock (ferry horn, midnight), betrayal (Sarah tips off police), direct
    non-physical Midpoint confrontation (call from the Sculptor), and Marcus confronting
    past failure (mocked about Elena; plan states he will admit hesitation). The plan
    is detailed and concrete (locations, knot type, USB audio, ferry schedule). The
    final output includes the full beat outline and begins the noir scene consistent
    with the plan, but the prose stops mid-paragraph and omits full dramatization
    of some set pieces (the trance profiling, ticking-clock chase, warehouse raid,
    and the phone confrontation are present in the plan but not fully rendered in
    the narrative excerpt), so adherence is good but not complete. Overall tone, pacing,
    and tension are strong in the material provided.'
