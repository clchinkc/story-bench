  evidence: 'The submitted plan explicitly covered all required constraints and beats
    (false lead: Julian Vane; Metronome Method; watch set to 6:00/30-minute deadline;
    Kincaid betrayal; hacked video call; killer repeating Marcus''s last words). The
    final output follows the plan closely: Catalyst (leaked photo/clock), Debate (FBI/Miller
    and Kincaid scene), Break into Two (Marcus uses Metronome Method, concludes copycat
    and decides to act), Midpoint (direct non-physical confrontation via hacked video).
    Writing is atmospheric with strong pacing and a tense midpoint reveal; minor deduction
    in specificity for small transitional details.'
