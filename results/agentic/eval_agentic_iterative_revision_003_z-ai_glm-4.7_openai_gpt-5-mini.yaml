  evidence: 'Across versions the piece clearly improves: V0 establishes setting and
    the basic choice but is spare on stakes; V1 makes small tonal edits; V2 introduces
    a concrete external pressure (landlord text) and Mateo''s distracted behavior,
    raising urgency; the final adds the crucial Abuela porch scene, a verbal crystallization
    of Mateo''s choice, and Tio Raul’s supportive intervention, which together produce
    a plausible turning point and an earned resolution. Good elements (panadería atmosphere,
    the flyer, family dynamics) are preserved and expanded. Remaining weakness: Mateo’s
    inner conflict is still often told (lines like “He was the reliable one… permanent
    knot of tension”) rather than consistently shown through sensory detail and micro-behaviors,
    so the “show, not tell” constraint is only partially met. Cultural touches feel
    authentic and one adult (Tio Raul, reinforced by Abuela) genuinely understands
    his dilemma, and the ending follows from his growth in the Abuela exchange and
    his confrontation with his mother.'
