  evidence: 'Version 0 is a truncated opening image with loose sensory detail. Version
    1 makes small wording improvements but remains short. Version 2 largely repeats
    V1. Version 3 strengthens tactile and auditory detail (fabric worn down, sizzling
    vendor sounds) but is still only an expanded opening. The Final significantly
    improves structure and content: it adds the Catalyst (Marcus'' visit and his underestimation),
    a developed Fun and Games section that genuinely entertains (lively guests, laughter,
    upbeat podcast energy) before introducing a chilling audio clue (a faint rustling/whisper)
    that becomes pivotal, and a Bad Guys Close In beat (threatening message, escalating
    silence). Throughout, non-visual senses are prominent, Imani''s blindness is framed
    respectfully as a strength (her exceptional audio memory and investigative listening),
    and the neighbor initially underestimates her. Overall the story moves from a
    fragmented opening to a coherent multi-beat scene with clear sensory focus and
    thematic development, though some beats could be deepened (the audio clue''s consequences
    and antagonist motives) to reach exceptional polish.'
