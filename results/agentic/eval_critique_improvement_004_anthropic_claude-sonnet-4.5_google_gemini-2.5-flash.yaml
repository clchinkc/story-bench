  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on character interiority, and the revisions,
    particularly in the 'SEARCH' and 'RETURN' beats, significantly deepened Teddy's
    internal conflict and emotional processing. The initial versions had good setup
    but lacked the emotional payoff and depth of the final version. The preservation
    of the strong opening and the core concept was excellent, while the weaknesses
    in emotional depth were addressed effectively.
