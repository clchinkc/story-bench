  evidence: The initial versions (0-3) were identical, indicating no iterative changes
    were made based on critiques. However, the 'Final output' provided is significantly
    different and improved, suggesting a single, comprehensive revision was applied
    after all critiques were received. The final output successfully addresses the
    'character_interiority' feedback by showing Teddy's internal state through actions
    and specific details ('His feet, usually so sure, faltered, rooted to the spot',
    'his fingers still slightly trembling from the unfamiliarity') rather than just
    stating it. The 'new path' constraint is well-executed, offering community and
    connection that the old path lacked. The 'disruption' clearly reveals Teddy's
    avoidance of change and loneliness. The 'late wife' is present through absence,
    and the 'neighbor' (Maya) intersects well with Teddy's story. The prose quality
    is strong, and the narrative flows well.
