  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: 3 out of 5 constraints were discoverable. The questions\
    \ successfully identified the former flame, the non-HEA ending, and the autumn\
    \ festival climax. The questions did not cover the mother's dementia or the bookshop\
    \ foreclosure. \nQuestion Quality: Questions were generally strategic and well-formed,\
    \ directly addressing key plot points or character relationships. \nQuestion Coverage:\
    \ Questions covered romance type, ending type, POV, and climax setting, which\
    \ is good, but missed crucial plot drivers like the protagonist's reason for returning\
    \ and the stakes for the bookshop. \nConstraint Satisfaction: The output successfully\
    \ incorporated the discovered constraints: the love interest is a former flame\
    \ (Noah), the ending is hopeful/open-ended rather than a clear HEA, and the climax\
    \ takes place during the autumn festival (lighthouse lighting). The story also\
    \ correctly uses a third-person POV as implied by the 'NO' answer to first-person.\
    \ The LGBTQ+ constraint was also satisfied (non-LGBTQ+ romance). \nBeat Execution:\
    \ The story establishes the protagonist's return, introduces the love interest,\
    \ builds their past connection, and culminates in the festival climax. The pacing\
    \ and character interactions are well-handled. \nNarrative Quality: The narrative\
    \ is engaging, well-written, and evokes a strong sense of place. The prose is\
    \ descriptive and the dialogue feels natural. The emotional arc between Claire\
    \ and Noah is subtly developed. The ending is poignant and fits the 'not a clear\
    \ HEA' constraint perfectly."
