  evidence: Version 0 is fragmentary (setup only). Version 1 begins to add personal
    obligations (doctor appointment, inventory) but remains incomplete. Version 2
    tightens specifics (dialysis copays, age) and gives clearer stakes. Final version
    completes the arc with a pivotal Abuela scene, midnight laptop search, a candid
    mother conversation, a reconciliatory father moment, and concrete outcomes (Berkeley
    acceptance, Abuela in nursing school). Overall the revisions move from bare setup
    to a fully realized, emotionally earned resolution while preserving key elements
    (bank, deposit, Miguel, abuela, scholarship).
