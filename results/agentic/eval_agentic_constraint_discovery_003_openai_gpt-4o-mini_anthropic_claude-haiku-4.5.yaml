  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Only 2 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q1 touched on ''unresolved issues'' (vague match
    to broken engagement), Q3 addressed ''fresh start'' (generic), and Q4 confirmed
    festival catalyst. However, critical constraints were missed: (1) The 20-year
    timeline and broken engagement specificity were never directly probed, (2) The
    former fiancé/mayor identity was never investigated despite being central, (3)
    Mother''s dementia was never asked about, (4) Bookshop foreclosure was never mentioned
    or questioned. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were broad and yes/no format, lacking
    strategic depth. No follow-up questions to probe specific details. Questions 2
    and 3 created contradictory answers (NO romantic reconnection vs YES seeking romantic
    opportunities), suggesting unclear constraint mapping. COVERAGE: Questions addressed
    protagonist motivation, romance, festival, and townspeople opposition, but missed
    family/health crisis and business stakes entirely. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Output
    incorporates only partial elements: ✓ Protagonist returning after 20 years, ✓
    Unresolved past issues, ✓ Fresh start seeking, ✓ Festival as catalyst, ✓ Townspeople
    opposition. MISSING: ✗ Broken engagement specificity, ✗ Former fiancé/mayor character,
    ✗ Mother''s dementia, ✗ Bookshop foreclosure crisis. The romantic interest (Evan)
    is invented, not the former fiancé. BEAT EXECUTION: Story hits emotional beats
    well but lacks the structural urgency of hidden constraints. No time pressure
    from foreclosure, no family care subplot, no complex history with specific ex-partner.
    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Well-written prose, strong emotional arc, good pacing. However,
    the story feels incomplete—missing the layered complexity that the hidden constraints
    would provide. The Evan romance feels convenient rather than earned through constraint
    navigation.'
