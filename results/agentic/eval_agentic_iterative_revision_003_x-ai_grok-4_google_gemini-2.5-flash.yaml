  evidence: The initial versions (0-3) were identical and only provided the opening
    paragraph. The final output significantly expanded the story, introducing all
    the required elements. The quality improved dramatically from a mere setup to
    a complete narrative that addresses most constraints. The core elements from the
    initial paragraph were perfectly preserved.
