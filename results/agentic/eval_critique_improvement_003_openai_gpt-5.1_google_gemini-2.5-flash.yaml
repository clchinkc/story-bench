  evidence: The critiques focused on 'youth_voice' and the revisions show a consistent
    effort to refine Zara's dialogue and internal monologue to sound more authentically
    12. Phrases like 'Okay, Sweepy, find us something that's not slime and disappointment'
    and 'That was one time' were highlighted as strong in early critiques and retained.
    The final version adds more nuanced moments like 'My throat felt tight' and 'I
    can read a sign, you know' which further solidify her age-appropriate voice without
    making her sound too young or too old. The revisions didn't introduce new issues
    while addressing the primary critique, indicating good preservation of strengths.
