  evidence: The revisions show an attempt to deepen Teddy's interiority, particularly
    around his grief for Marlene and his fear of loneliness, as highlighted in the
    critiques. The final output includes more explicit statements about his internal
    state ('the silence pressing in like a weight on his chest,' 'fear that without
    it, he might drift into a solitude deeper than he could bear'). The introduction
    of Clara and Mrs. Jenkins helps to satisfy the 'neighbor' and 'new path' constraints
    more effectively than earlier versions. However, the 'disruption revealing something
    Teddy has been avoiding' is still somewhat generic ('he realized how deeply he
    had been avoiding the reality of her absence, using his routine to shield himself
    from the pain') rather than a specific, nuanced avoidance. The prose quality remains
    consistent, and the core strengths of the initial setup are preserved.
