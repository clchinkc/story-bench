  evidence: The plan addresses most constraints and beats, though the mentor's unconventionality
    could be more specific. The output adheres well to the plan. All beats are executed.
    The constraint regarding the alien signal feeling genuinely alien is not fully
    met; it's described as a 'multi-sensory code that required emotional understanding,'
    which leans anthropomorphic. The other constraints are well-satisfied. The narrative
    quality is good, with decent pacing and character development.
