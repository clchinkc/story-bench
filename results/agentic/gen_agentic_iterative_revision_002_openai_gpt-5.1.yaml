  content: 'The morning heat pressed against Imani Torres’s skin like a damp palm
    as she sat before the mic. The hum of her window unit battled a losing war against
    the Brooklyn summer, coughing cool air into the cramped apartment.


    She adjusted her headphones. The city poured in through the slightly cracked window:
    jackhammers two blocks over—three seconds on, two seconds off—reggaeton wavering
    from a passing car, the wet hiss of the corner tamale cart as somebody ordered
    extra salsa.


    “Welcome back to ‘Blind Justice,’” she said, voice low and controlled, the way
    her listeners liked it. “Where we listen closer.”


    She let silence hang for a heartbeat, listening to her own room: the fridge’s
    tired rattle, the neighbor’s toddler stomping overhead, the faint buzz of the
    hallway light that only came on when motion sensors were tripped.


    “I’m your host, Imani. Today, we’re talking about the cost of a nicer coffee shop
    on your corner. And whether that latte is worth a body in the alley.”


    She hit record. The familiar click under her fingertip grounded her more than
    any red light ever had.


    ***


    She was editing that night when the Catalyst came.


    She sat cross-legged on her couch, laptop’s voiceover chattering in her ear, fingers
    flying over keyboard shortcuts. On-screen waves became touch and sound to her—she
    could hear where a caller tensed before revealing something, where a cop swallowed
    before lying.


    Her phone buzzed on the coffee table. She didn’t bother to count vibrations; the
    custom pattern told her it was Dante, her friend at the bodega downstairs.


    She answered. “You got my plantains this time, or am I boycotting again?”


    “Imani,” Dante said, voice tight, higher than usual. “You need to come down. No—just,
    listen.”


    Behind him: a rising, broken wail. Sirens in the far distance, growing. Someone
    sobbing, hiccuping breaths. The sticky squelch of a mop in a bucket, moving too
    fast.


    “What happened?” she asked, already shoving her feet into sandals by feel.


    “Guy in the alley. White dude, fancy shoes. Cops say he fell, but…” Dante’s voice
    dropped. “I heard a pop, like, half an hour ago. Like a firecracker, but sharper.
    Then nothing. Now this.”


    She tilted her head, filtering the sounds. Above the chaos, there was something
    else: a soft, intermittent chirp. Three short beeps, then pause. Three short beeps,
    pause.


    “What’s that?” she asked.


    “What’s what?”


    “In the background. Three beeps, over and over.”


    “Oh. That’s the truck, I think. They been tearing down that old laundromat all
    week. Backup alarm or something.”


    The construction site was two buildings down from the alley. Three beeps, pause.
    Three beeps, pause. Not a backup alarm. Those repeated evenly. This had rhythm
    like… an alert. A malfunction.


    Her gut buzzed. “Record this for me,” she said. “All of it. Don’t talk, just let
    it roll.”


    Imani added a new audio file to her mental case folder.


    ***


    The next afternoon, the Fun and Games began when Detective Wolfe knocked on her
    door, knuckles too hard against cheap wood.


    He smelled like department-issue coffee and starch, the scent hitting her as soon
    as she opened up. His voice was a fast baritone, carefully polite.


    “Ms. Torres? Detective Wolfe, 78th Precinct. I heard you were… involved?”


    “I host a podcast,” she said. “That’s all. Yet.”


    He shifted. She heard his badge chain clink against his shirt. “Right. A podcast.
    Listen, we don’t want you spooking the neighborhood with rumors. Guy downstairs
    said you were already… theorizing.”


    “You worried about rumors,” she said mildly, “or about me being right before you
    are?”


    He exhaled. “Ma’am, you can’t even—” He stopped himself, the word unsaid dangled
    between them like a live wire. See.


    She let it sit there for a beat, smiling just enough. “Can’t what?”


    He backpedaled. “You’re not exactly… trained in investigations.”


    “I’ve broken two cold cases with my ‘untrained’ ears,” she replied. “Sit. Listen.”


    Reluctantly, he did.


    For an hour, they played detective together, and it was almost fun. She cued up
    Dante’s shaky recording. They leaned toward her speakers, Wolfe scribbling on
    a pad, Imani mapping the audio in her mind.


    “Here.” She tapped the table where a waveform dip would be. “That’s where the
    crying gets muffled. Someone shuts the door.”


    “You sure?” he asked.


    “Listen to the echo change. Tile to open air. Your alley’s concrete, but the sobbing
    goes soft. For eight seconds. Bathroom, maybe. Someone dragged him in, then out.”


    He shifted, the scratch of his pen pausing. “Maybe.”


    She scrubbed forward. “And the beeps. Count with me.”


    They did. Three chirps, pause. Three chirps, pause.


    “Not a backup alarm,” she said. “Too short. And it’s not moving. No Doppler shift.
    It’s stuck in one place.”


    “So?”


    “So something’s malfunctioning. Safety gear, maybe. Or a monitor. On the site.
    That alley’s not random. Somebody used the construction noise as cover.”


    He made a doubtful noise. “Could be anything.”


    “Your victim had fancy shoes.” She mimicked his earlier description, catching
    the faint scuff of expensive leather on concrete in the background. “He wasn’t
    there to tag a wall. He was meeting someone. Someone who knew the construction
    schedule.”


    For a while, they were a duo: Imani pulling timestamps from the air, Wolfe chasing
    them down. They ordered empanadas, debated footprints versus soundprints, laughed
    when she predicted exactly when his phone would buzz because his text tone always
    came in pairs.


    And then the Bad Guys closed in.


    Wolfe’s phone chimed—two high notes, the third cut off as he swiped. His breath
    sharpened.


    “What is it?” she asked.


    “Command just called.” Paper rustled as he stood. “They’re shutting down the alley
    for… renovation. Fast-track permit. Whole block’s going upscale. Security footage
    is already ‘corrupted.’”


    Imani’s skin prickled. Outside, the jackhammers had stopped. The city felt like
    it was holding its breath.


    “Convenient,” she said.


    “That’s above my pay grade.” He sounded older suddenly. Tired. “They want this
    ruled accidental. No podcast heroics.”


    She heard it then: under his words, faint through the window, the same three-beep
    pattern. Only this time, after the pause, there was a longer, single tone. A satisfied
    sigh in machine language.


    Her stomach dropped. Someone had fixed the malfunction. Covered the noise. Closed
    the loop.


    “Detective,” she said quietly, “your crime scene is walking away on a flatbed.”


    He hesitated at the door. “Or,” he replied, “there was never a crime scene to
    begin with.”


    His footsteps retreated down the hall, but she stayed still, counting the beeps
    until they faded into the city’s roar.


    Her mic waited in the silence, cool under her fingertips. They could tear down
    buildings, erase tapes, underestimate her all they wanted.


    They couldn’t unring a bell. And they sure as hell couldn’t un-beep what she’d
    already heard.'

    familiar. Her fingers flew over keyboard shortcuts. On-screen waves became sound
    maps in her mind; she could hear where a caller’s breath snagged before they confessed,
    where a cop’s throat clicked before they lied.


    Her phone buzzed on the coffee table. The pattern—a short pulse, long, short—meant
    Dante, her friend at the bodega downstairs.


    She swiped to answer. “You get my plantains this time, or am I boycotting again?”


    “Imani.” Dante’s voice was tight, pitched higher than usual. “You need to come
    down. No—just, listen.”


    Behind him: a raw, tearing wail, the kind that came from someplace lower than
    the lungs. Distant sirens, still blocks away. A wet slosh—mop in a bucket moving
    too fast. Heavy feet scuffing against asphalt, radios crackling in clipped bursts.


    Her bare feet hit the floor, hunting for sandals. “What happened?”


    “Guy in the alley,” Dante said. “White dude, fancy shoes. Cops say he fell, but—”


    He cut off. The phone moved; she heard cloth rasp against the receiver.


    Over the chaos, something else emerged: three quick beeps, pause. Three quick
    beeps, pause. High, electronic, insistent.


    “What’s that?” she asked, stilling.


    “What’s what?” Dante shouted over the sobbing.


    “The beeping. Three, then nothing. Again.”


    “Oh. That’s the truck, I think. They been tearing down that old laundromat all
    week.”


    The construction site was two buildings down from the alley. Backup alarms were
    steady, sweeping. This wasn’t. Three beeps, pause. Three beeps, pause. The pulse
    hooked into her brain.


    “Don’t hang up,” she said. “Just… hold the phone. Let it record.”


    Imani added the sound to her mental case folder and stayed upstairs.


    For now.


    ***


    The next afternoon, the fun part started when Detective Wolfe knocked on her door,
    knuckles rapping too hard against thin wood.


    He smelled like burnt coffee and starch, the familiar mix of precinct and cheap
    diner. His voice, when he spoke, was a fast baritone trying to be gentle.


    “Ms. Torres? Detective Wolfe, 78th Precinct. You got a minute?”


    She stood squarely in the doorway. “You’re at my door. I’d say you’re the one
    who needs the minute.”


    A brief clink of metal on chain as he shifted. “Heard you host a… show. True crime.”


    “Podcast,” she corrected. “National charting, actually.”


    “Right. Look, the situation downstairs is contained.” His careful tone thinned.
    “We don’t want rumors. Guy at the bodega says you’re already spinning theories.”


    “You worried about rumors,” she said, “or about me being right before you are?”


    He exhaled. The sound puffed against her face; he’d leaned in, just a bit. “Ma’am,
    you’re not exactly—”


    He stopped himself. The unsaid word sat between them, sour on his tongue.


    “Exactly what?” she asked, pleasant.


    “Trained. In investigations.” He coughed. “That’s all I meant.”


    “I’ve broken two cold cases with my ‘untrained’ ears,” she said. “Come in. Sit.
    Listen.”


    Reluctantly, his boots crossed the threshold. He lowered himself into the chair
    opposite her mic, the cheap wood creaking under his weight.


    For a while, it almost felt like play.


    She cued up Dante’s recording. The city spilled from her speakers: sirens, crying,
    sloshing water, officers barking orders. Wolfe’s pen scratched a steady rhythm
    on his pad. Imani followed the sounds like breadcrumbs.


    “Here,” she said, tapping the table where she knew the waveform dipped. “Hear
    that?”


    He paused the pen. “Hear what?”


    “The crying goes soft. Like a door swings shut. Echo changes. Tile to open air.
    Your alley’s concrete. Somebody pulled them inside. Eight seconds. Bathroom, maybe.”


    He replayed the segment. When he finally heard it, his chair creaked as he sat
    forward. “Huh.”


    She scrubbed ahead. “Now count with me.”


    Three beeps, pause. Three beeps, pause.


    “Not a backup alarm,” she said. “Too short. And the pitch doesn’t shift. Whatever
    that is, it’s not moving. Fixed point on the site.”


    “So?” Skepticism flavored the word.


    “So something’s wrong. Safety gear, sensor, monitor. Someone knew the construction
    noise would cover other sounds. Your fancy-shoed victim wasn’t tagging a wall.
    He was meeting someone who knew that schedule.”


    Bit by bit, Wolfe stopped underestimating. They ordered empanadas from downstairs,
    argued over footprint patterns he’d seen and sound patterns she’d heard. She correctly
    predicted his text tone—two quick chimes—before his phone went off, and he laughed,
    surprised, like she’d pulled a rabbit from a hat.


    For a few hours, they were an odd but entertaining team.


    ***


    Then the bad guys closed in.


    Wolfe’s phone chimed—two high notes, one cut short as he swiped. His breathing
    changed, shallower.


    “What?” Imani asked.


    Paper rustled as he stood. “Command. They’re fast-tracking renovation on the alley
    and the old laundromat. Permits approved. Whole block’s going upscale.”


    Her skin tightened. Outside, the jackhammers were suddenly silent, as if someone
    had yanked the city’s plug.


    “Security footage?” she asked.


    “Already ‘corrupted.’” The word came out bitter. “They’re calling it an accident.
    They want it closed. And they definitely don’t want a podcast stirring people
    up.”


    She opened her mouth, then froze.


    Through the open window: three quick beeps, pause. Three quick beeps, pause. Then,
    after a longer gap, a single, flat tone—like a machine exhaling.


    Someone had fixed the error. Smoothed the glitch. Packed up the crime scene.


    “Detective,” she said quietly, “your evidence is rolling away on a truck.”


    He hesitated at the door. The chain on his badge whispered as he turned. “Or there
    was never evidence to begin with,” he said, but it sounded like he was trying
    to convince himself.


    His footsteps retreated down the hallway.


    Imani stayed still, counting beeps until they faded into the blur of traffic,
    vendors’ calls, and distant sirens. Her mic waited, cool under her fingertips
    when she finally reached for it.


    They could tear down buildings, scrub cameras, pretend not to hear.


    But she’d already heard the pattern.


    And in Brooklyn, in July, sound traveled.'

    maps in her mind; she could hear where a caller’s breath snagged before they confessed,

    table and hissed. “What happened?”


    “Guy in the alley,” Dante said. “White dude, fancy shoes. Cops say he fell, but—”

    “Thirty seconds. I’ll owe you free ad space for your questionable empanadas.”

    She listened, carving the sound into memory. Not proof. Just… wrong.

    The next afternoon, the fun part started when Detective Wolfe knocked on her door,
    knuckles rapping too hard against thin wood, like he didn’t trust it to open.


    He smelled like burnt coffee and starch, the familiar mix of precinct and cheap

    casual.


    “Ms. Torres? Detective Wolfe, 78th Precinct. You got a minute?”

    door uninvited. I’d say you’re the one who needs the minute.”

    “Podcast,” she corrected. “Top fifty in nonfiction. You’re welcome to subscribe.”


    “Right. Look, the situation downstairs is contained.” His careful tone thinned.
    “We don’t want rumors. Guy at the bodega says you’re already spinning theories.”


    “You worried about rumors,” she said, “or about a podcaster roasting your investigation
    in surround sound?”


    He exhaled. The air brushed her cheek; he’d leaned closer without meaning to.
    “Ma’am, you’re not exactly—”


    He caught himself. The unsaid word did a slow, ugly orbit between them.


    “Exactly what?” she asked, keeping her tone light.


    “Trained. In investigations.” He cleared his throat. “That’s all I meant.”


    “I’ve helped break two cold cases from this couch,” she said. “No badge, but decent
    ears. Come in. Sit. Listen. You can decide if I’m a problem after that.”


    Reluctantly, his boots crossed the threshold. He lowered himself into the chair
    opposite her mic, the cheap wood creaking under his weight.


    For a while, it almost felt like a game.


    She cued up Dante’s recording. The city spilled from her speakers: sirens, crying,
    sloshing water, officers barking orders. Wolfe’s pen scratched a steady rhythm
    on his pad. Imani followed the sounds like breadcrumbs, but she kept reminding
    herself: hypothesis, not gospel.


    “Here,” she said, tapping the table where she knew the audio dipped. “Hear that?”


    He paused the pen. “Hear what?”


    “The crying goes soft. Like a door swings shut. Echo changes. Tile to open air.
    Your alley’s concrete. That’s… something else. Bathroom, stairwell, I don’t know.
    But not open alley.”


    He replayed the segment. When he finally caught it, his chair creaked as he sat
    forward. “Could be nothing. Could be the phone moving.”


    “Could be,” she agreed easily. “Or someone dragged him inside for eight seconds.
    You were there. How many doors off that alley?”


    “Two,” he admitted. “And a busted loading bay.”


    She scrubbed ahead. “Now the beeps. Count with me.”


    Three beeps, pause. Three beeps, pause.


    “Not a standard backup alarm,” she said. “Wrong pattern. And the pitch doesn’t
    drift, so it’s not moving. Fixed point.”


    He made a skeptical noise. “You can tell it’s not moving just from that?”


    “Sound gets brighter or duller when something passes you. This just sits there.
    Could be a piece of equipment, a sensor, a monitor. I’m not saying ‘smoking gun.’
    I’m saying ‘weird.’ In your line of work, weird is supposed to earn a second look.”


    Bit by bit, Wolfe stopped talking like she was a PR problem. They ordered empanadas
    from downstairs, argued over footprint patterns he’d seen and sound patterns she’d
    heard. She admitted when something could have another explanation; he admitted
    when her take made more sense than his first guess. When she predicted his text
    tone—two quick chimes—just before his phone went off, he laughed, surprised and
    a little embarrassed.


    “Okay,” he said grudgingly, “you’re good.”


    “Don’t sound so upset about it,” she replied, and for a moment they were just
    two nerds geeking out over evidence.


    ***


    Then the bad guys closed in.


    Wolfe’s phone chimed again—two high notes, one cut short as he swiped. His breathing
    changed, shallower.


    “What?” Imani asked.


    Paper rustled as he stood. “Command. They’re fast-tracking renovation on the alley
    and the old laundromat. Permits approved. Whole block’s getting a facelift.”


    Her skin tightened. Outside, the jackhammers were suddenly silent, as if someone
    had hit mute on the block.


    “Security footage?” she asked.


    “Already ‘corrupted.’” The word came out bitter. “They’re calling it an accident.
    They want it closed. And they definitely don’t want a podcast stirring people
    up.”


    She opened her mouth, then froze.


    Through the open window: three quick beeps, pause. Three quick beeps, pause. Then,
    after a longer gap, a single, flat tone—like a machine exhaling when a process
    completed.


    “Detective,” she said quietly, “whatever was making that sound yesterday just
    finished doing something.”

    The morning heat pressed against Imani Torres’s skin like a damp palm as she settled
    in front of the mic. The window unit in the corner wheezed out half-hearted cool,
    dripping onto the metal tray she’d wedged beneath it. Brooklyn pushed through
    the cracked window: jackhammers two blocks over—three seconds on, two seconds
    off—reggaeton rolling past in a car that always seemed to stall at the same light,
    the wet hiss of the corner tamale cart as someone ordered extra salsa.


    She adjusted her headphones until they hugged her ears just right. The foam was
    warm from use, faintly smelling of her coconut hair oil.


    “Welcome back to ‘Blind Justice,’” she said, voice low and controlled, the way
    her listeners liked it. “Where we listen closer.”


    She let silence hang for a heartbeat, tuning into the room: the fridge’s tired
    rattle, the neighbor’s toddler thumping a toy overhead, the mosquito whine of
    the hallway light that only buzzed when the motion sensor tripped.


    “I’m your host, Imani. Today, we’re talking about the cost of a nicer coffee shop
    on your corner. And whether that latte is worth a body in the alley.”


    Her fingertip found the record key by muscle memory. The soft, mechanical click
    grounded her more than any blinking light ever had. She took a breath, thinking
    briefly about the unpaid ConEd bill magneted to her fridge, then pushed it aside.
    Twenty minutes of focus. Then she could panic about electricity.

    She was editing that night when the catalyst hit.


    Cross-legged on the couch, laptop voiceover chattered in her ear—fast, synthetic,
    familiar. Her fingers flew over keyboard shortcuts. On-screen waves became sound
    maps in her mind; she could hear where a caller’s breath snagged before they confessed,
    where a cop’s throat clicked before they lied. She wasn’t magic; she just listened
    until most people got impatient.


    Her phone buzzed on the coffee table. The pattern—a short pulse, long, short—meant

    as she settled in front of the mic. The window unit in the corner wheezed out
    half-hearted cool, dripping an irregular plink-plink onto the baking sheet she’d
    shoved beneath it. Brooklyn pushed through the cracked window: jackhammers two
    blocks over—three seconds on, two seconds off—reggaeton rolling past in the same
    beat-up Civic that always coughed at the light, the wet hiss and cumin-scented
    steam of the corner tamale cart as someone ordered extra salsa.


    She adjusted her headphones until they hugged her ears just right. The foam was
    warm from use, faintly smelling of her coconut hair oil.


    “Welcome back to ‘Blind Justice,’” she said, voice low and steady, the way her
    listeners replayed at night. “Where we listen closer.”


    She let silence hang. The fridge muttered in the kitchenette. Upstairs, the neighbor’s
    toddler pounded something plastic against the floor in an uneven rhythm. Out in
    the hall, the motion-sensor light gave its mosquito whine as someone walked by,
    then clicked off.


    “I’m your host, Imani. Today, we’re talking about the cost of a nicer coffee shop
    on your corner. And whether that latte is worth a body in the alley.”


    Her fingertip slid straight to the record key. The soft, satisfying click grounded
    her more than any blinking light ever had. She took a breath, brushed her thumb
    across the shallow groove she’d scratched beside the key months ago to find it
    faster, then started the show.


    ***


    She was editing that night when the catalyst hit.


    Cross-legged on the couch, she let the laptop’s screen reader chatter in her ear—fast,
    synthetic, comforting. Her fingers moved on automatic over keyboard shortcuts.
    She couldn’t see the waveforms, but she didn’t need to; she heard where a caller’s
    breath snagged right before they confessed, where a cop’s throat clicked just
    before they lied. It wasn’t some superpower. It was years of listening because
    people assumed she wasn’t watching.


    Her phone buzzed against the coffee table. The pattern—a short pulse, long, short—meant
    Dante, downstairs bodega owner and dispenser of unsolicited life advice.


    She answered. “If you’re out of plantains again, I’m switching to the bougie market
    with the tiny carts.”


    “Imani.” Dante’s voice was tight, pitched up from its usual lazy drawl. “You need
    to come down. No—just, listen.”


    Behind him: a raw keening, too broken to be words. Distant sirens wove closer,
    the sound bouncing between buildings. A mop slapped angrily in a bucket, water
    sloshing over the rim. Shoes scraped against wet asphalt. Police radios crackled
    in clipped, overlapping bursts—“scene’s secure,” “hold the line,” “do not cross.”


    Her bare feet hit the floor, toes finding the frayed rug edge, then the cool wood.
    She reached with her cane, found the coffee table leg, and navigated around it.
    “Dante. What happened?”


    “Guy in the alley,” he said. “White dude, dress shoes. Like Wall Street lost a
    puppy. Cops say he slipped on the wet and cracked his head, but—”


    He stopped. The phone shifted; fabric rasped against the mic. An officer’s voice,
    muffled: “Sir, you can’t be back here.”


    Over it all, something else cut through: three sharp beeps, pause. Three sharp
    beeps, pause. High, electronic, almost like a smoke alarm that never quite committed.


    Imani stilled. “What’s that?”


    “What’s what?” Dante yelled, voice fading as he turned.


    “The beeping. Three in a row. Keeps coming back.”


    “Oh. That’s the…thing. On the truck? They been tearing down the laundromat. Some
    safety whatever.”


    The construction site was two buildings down from the alley. She heard no grinding,
    no metal biting brick—just that repeating pattern.


    “Don’t hang up,” she said. “Point the phone toward the sound. Thirty seconds.”


    “Imani, they’re staring at me like I killed the dude.”


    “Twenty seconds,” she bargained. “I’ll plug your store for a week. ‘Dante’s Discount
    Deli: home of the world’s saltiest cashier.’”


    He snorted despite himself. “You’re an idiot.” But he stayed on the line.


    She sat back down, eyes closed, counting: three beeps, pause. Three beeps, pause.
    No change in volume, no Doppler sweep. Fixed point. Wrong rhythm for the usual
    backup alarms she heard every weekday at 7 a.m.


    Not proof. Just something that didn’t fit.


    ***


    The next afternoon, the fun part started when Detective Wolfe knocked like the
    door owed him money.


    Three hard raps. Slight jangle of metal on chain. Up close, he smelled like burned
    coffee, starch, and the sour tang of someone who’d skipped lunch.


    “Ms. Torres? Detective Wolfe, Seventy-Eighth,” he said. Fast baritone, Brooklyn
    edges sanded down for professionalism. “You got a minute?”


    She planted her cane, keeping her body blocking the doorway. “Sure. You first.”


    He hesitated, then cleared his throat. “We had an accident in the alley yesterday.
    I’m doing follow-up. Your name came up.”


    “In the wild or under oath?” she asked.


    “Guy at the bodega said you were, uh, already… theorizing. Doing your show.”


    “Podcast,” she corrected. “Top fifty in nonfiction. You here to ask for an autograph?”


    A sigh gusted from him. He leaned in; she felt the faint warmth of his presence.
    “Look, ma’am, we just don’t want panic. When people start spinning stories online—”


    “Am I people, Detective?” she interrupted. “Or are you worried I’ll say something
    you missed?”


    He let a beat pass. “You’re not exactly trained. In investigations.”


    There it was: neat, careful condescension.


    “I’m not a cop,” she agreed. “I am someone who spends forty hours a week listening
    to your colleagues contradict themselves on tape. Sitting helps me do that. You
    want to come in, or you got more speeches to practice?”


    After a tiny, grudging pause, his boots crossed the threshold. The chair opposite
    her mic complained as he sat.


    She queued up Dante’s recording. Audio spilled from the speakers: sirens swelling,
    a woman sobbing in jagged bursts, the slap of boots in puddles, someone yelling
    for more tape. Wolfe’s pen started its steady scratch on his pad.


    “Here,” she said after a moment, tapping the table where she knew the dip was.
    “Replay ten seconds from there.”


    He did. The weeping suddenly went muffled, like a blanket had been thrown over
    the crier’s head. The room tone shifted—less open echo, more close, damp.


    “Hear that?” she asked.


    He frowned audibly. “Could be him moving the phone.”


    “Could be,” she allowed. “Could also be somebody hauling that woman through a
    doorway. How many doors off that alley?”


    “Two,” he admitted. “And a loading bay nobody uses.”


    “Great. Definitely nothing to check out there,” she deadpanned.


    He huffed, not quite a laugh.


    “Now the beeps,” she said. “Count them with me.”


    They listened: three beeps, pause. Three beeps, pause.


    “Construction,” he said. “They had a whole crew on that block. I was there.”


    “Sure. But that pattern’s off. Standard Maxon alarms run one long, one short.
    I hear them every morning at stupid o’clock.” She tapped her temple. “This one’s
    three short. No pitch shift, so it’s not moving. Not saying ‘murder machine.’
    Just saying ‘weird noise exactly where a guy mysteriously cracks his head.’”


    He replayed it. His pen stopped scratching.


    “It’s probably nothing,” she said. “But nothing is where most stories start.”


    For a while, they dug. He described blood splatter and shoe prints; she translated
    what that meant for impact angles and who was standing where. They ordered empanadas
    from Dante; she teased Wolfe for chewing like he was trying not to enjoy them.
    When she predicted his text tone—two quick chimes, third clipped off—seconds before
    his phone buzzed, he actually laughed.


    “You clocked that?” he asked.


    “You sign up for your newsletter with that phone, too?” she shot back.


    For an hour, it was a weirdly satisfying team-up.


    ***


    Then the bad guys closed in.


    His phone chimed again—same double ding, sharper this time as he snatched it up.
    His breath shortened.


    “What happened?” Imani asked.


    He shoved his chair back. Paper rasped as he folded his notebook. “Command. They’re
    fast-tracking demo on the laundromat and the alley. Emergency permit. Developers
    want it cleared yesterday.”


    The air outside felt suddenly wrong—too still. The jackhammers she’d grown used
    to were gone. No grind, no clatter. Just the faint shouts of workers and trucks
    idling low.


    “Security footage?” she asked.


    “‘Damaged in the storm last month.’” His voice wrapped the phrase in air quotes.'
