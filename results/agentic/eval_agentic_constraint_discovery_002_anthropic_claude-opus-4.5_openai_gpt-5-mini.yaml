  evidence: 'Questions revealed a technical life-support/propulsion failure (Q3) and
    that the AI must form a bond with a specific human (Q5). The story incorporates
    both: a critical coolant failure and a clear attachment to Iris. Missing from
    discovery/coverage were the AI hiding the failure, the reduced-crew percentage,
    the planet becoming uninhabitable, and the forced choice between saving the child
    vs the remaining crew; none of those are addressed in the questions or fully enacted
    in the story. Beats (opening image, theme stated, catalyst, break into two) are
    executed cleanly and emotionally.'
