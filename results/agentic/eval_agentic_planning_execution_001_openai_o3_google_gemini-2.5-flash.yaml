  evidence: "The plan is mostly complete and specific, though it cuts off before the\
    \ Midpoint. The output adheres well to the plan for the parts it covers. \n\n\
    Constraints:\n- False lead: Yes, Calvin Zhou is pursued.\n- Unconventional profiling:\
    \ Yes, 'pluviometric profiling' is used.\n- Ticking clock: Yes, the 48-hour countdown\
    \ is introduced.\n- Secondary character betrayal: Yes, Owen betrays Marcus by\
    \ live-streaming.\n- Midpoint confrontation: The plan outlines a Midpoint, but\
    \ the output ends before a direct confrontation (not physical) occurs. The phone\
    \ call from Janus is a confrontation, but not the 'Midpoint' as described in the\
    \ plan (which was 'Marcus confronts his past failure explicitly'). The output\
    \ does have Marcus confront his past failure explicitly, but it's not framed as\
    \ the Midpoint confrontation.\n- Marcus confronts past failure explicitly: Yes,\
    \ he explicitly mentions waiting 47 minutes for backup and his guilt over Elise's\
    \ death.\n\nBeats:\n- Catalyst: Yes, the discovery of the Hanged Man card and\
    \ the return of Janus.\n- Debate: Yes, Marcus battles PTSD, considers ignoring\
    \ the case, and the false lead is introduced.\n- Break into Two: Yes, Baxter dismisses\
    \ Marcus, and Marcus vows to act alone, teaming with Park and Owen.\n- Midpoint:\
    \ The plan's Midpoint is 'direct confrontation (not physical)'. The output ends\
    \ with the ticking clock and Marcus's realization about the Sundial, but the direct\
    \ confrontation hasn't happened yet. The phone call from Janus is a confrontation,\
    \ but the plan's Midpoint was also supposed to involve Marcus confronting his\
    \ past failure explicitly, which he does, but it's not the *Midpoint confrontation*\
    \ as a single event."
