  evidence: 'Plan: clear thematic core and character arcs but the submitted plan excerpt
    was partially truncated and did not lay out discrete act beats explicitly (plan_completeness
    0.70). The plan included concrete sensory and plot detail (plan_specificity 0.80).
    Final story follows the plan closely—sensory focus, food-as-memory, daughter return,
    tape recording reveal, Mr. Choi as a mirror (plan_adherence 0.90). Constraints:
    satisfied — (1) food used symbolically multiple times (kimchi, dumplings/ginger),
    (2) David''s grief shown indirectly, (3) daughter''s estrangement has a clear,
    believable cause (mother asked David to let her go; David told Grace to leave),
    (4) regular customer Mr. Choi present and represents memory, (5) ending is hopeful
    but bittersweet. Not fully satisfied — (6) a distinct Korean cultural element
    beyond food is weak or absent; most cultural signifiers are food-related or general
    (chopsticks, names, barley tea) and no explicit non-food cultural practice/language/custom
    is clearly developed. Beats: Setup (opening & demolition notice), Confrontation
    (Grace''s return, discovery of tape, conflict), Resolution (demolition imminent
    but father and daughter choose to make dinner together) are all present. Narrative
    quality: strong sensory writing, good pacing and emotional resonance with a believable,
    restrained hopeful ending.'
