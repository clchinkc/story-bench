    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: '"Okay, here’s the beat," Marcus Webb said, capping the dry-erase marker
    with a sharp *click*. "Dad thinks ''Netflix and chill'' is a literal suggestion
    to watch movies in a cold basement. He shows up with a space heater and a down
    comforter."


    The room erupted. Seven writers in various states of dishevelment—hoodies, blazers
    over t-shirts, bare feet—howled. Marcus smiled. It was the kind of smile that
    required zero muscle engagement, just a reflexive baring of teeth.


    "Great, great," Marcus said, his voice flat. "Let’s punch that up and get it on
    the board before lunch."


    He turned back to the whiteboard, covered in the skeletal remains of a sitcom:
    *Act One: The Setup*, *Act Two: The Complication*, *Act Three: The Lesson Nobody
    Learns*. He wrote *SPACE HEATER* under the ''B'' story, his hand moving with the
    efficiency of a machine. He hadn''t felt a genuine spark of joy in three years.
    The laughter in the room sounded like static to him, just white noise against
    the constant hum of his own exhaustion.


    "You know," said Jerry, the showrunner, picking at a container of lukewarm pad
    thai. He wasn''t looking at anyone, just staring at the noodles. "A joke only
    lands if there’s a little bit of truth underneath it. If you stop caring about
    the truth, you’re just writing noise."


    Marcus stared at the word *HEATER*. The letters blurred. He thought about the
    spec script he wrote when he was twenty-two, the one that made him cry while he
    typed it because it was about his father leaving. He remembered the feeling of
    reaching into his chest and pulling something out, raw and bleeding, and putting
    it on the page. His throat tightened, a hot, sharp pressure building behind his
    eyes. He gripped the marker until his knuckles turned white.


    He swallowed hard, the sensation painful. He turned to the room, the mask snapping
    back into place. "Well, Jerry, if I write any more truth, I’ll need a therapy
    co-writer credit. Let''s stick to the space heater."


    The room chuckled, relieved. Marcus exhaled, the moment passing.


    The door swung open. A young woman stood there, clutching a notebook. She looked
    twenty-five, maybe younger, but her eyes were old. This was Maya, the staff writer
    the network had forced on them.


    "Sorry I''m late," she said, stepping over a pile of discarded pizza boxes. "I
    was watching a clown cry at the intersection of Hollywood and Highland. It was
    funnier than anything I saw on TV last year."


    The room went silent. Marcus looked at her, ready to crush the new girl. It was
    the rite of passage. Someone had done it to him in 1998. Someone had to do it
    to her.


    "Sit down, ''Funny Girl''," Marcus sneered, leaning back in his chair. "We’re
    working on a real show here. Clowns are for circuses."


    Maya didn''t flinch. She walked right up to the whiteboard, standing beside him.
    She didn''t look at the board; she looked at him. She scanned his face, reading
    the lines of exhaustion, the dead eyes, the forced posture of a man holding up
    a ceiling that was about to collapse.


    "You''re Marcus Webb," she said quietly. "You wrote the ''Funeral'' episode of
    *City Lights*. It’s the only thing that made me laugh last year."


    She paused, her gaze piercing. "But you don''t look like a guy who can write that
    anymore. You look like a guy who''s forgotten how to cry."


    Marcus opened his mouth to deliver a kill shot, a witty barb that would send her
    running to the bathroom, but the words died in his throat. She knew. She saw the
    hollow space where the laughter used to live. For the first time in three years,
    the static in his head cleared, and he felt something dangerous: hope.'

    \ 0.72**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Strength: \"He hadn't felt a genuine spark of joy\
    \ in three years. The laughter in the room sounded like static to him\"—this establishes\
    \ the pathos clearly.\n- The joke lands (\"Dad thinks 'Netflix and chill' is a\
    \ literal suggestion...\"), then immediately we see Marcus's hollow interior (\"\
    smile that required zero muscle engagement\").\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The story successfully\
    \ creates contrast between surface humor and internal sadness, but the *transition*\
    \ between them happens too quickly. The joke gets two sentences of setup, then\
    \ we're already inside Marcus's dead interior. Extend the humor beat—let us genuinely\
    \ laugh *with* Marcus before we see the void. Give the space heater joke 4-5 more\
    \ lines of workshop riffing. This makes the pivot to his emotional breakdown more\
    \ devastating by contrast.\n\nAdditionally, Maya's confrontation resolves too\
    \ neatly. \"Hope\" appears in the final line, but we haven't earned the emotional\
    \ payoff. A truly complex ending would leave Marcus *between* states—seen but\
    \ not healed.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\n**SCORE: 0.95**\n\
    \n**EVIDENCE:**\n1. ✓ Laugh before sadness: \"Netflix and chill\" joke works as\
    \ comedy first.\n2. ✓ Theme by minor character: Jerry delivers \"A joke only lands\
    \ if there's a little bit of truth underneath it.\"\n3. ✓ Comedy craft detail:\
    \ Whiteboard structure (*Act One: The Setup, Act Two: The Complication, Act Three:\
    \ The Lesson Nobody Learns*), \"punch that up,\" story beats.\n4. ✓ Maya sees\
    \ through Marcus: \"You look like a guy who's forgotten how to cry\"—direct penetration\
    \ of his mask.\n5. ✓ Marcus almost breaks, covers with joke: The spec script memory\
    \ triggers genuine emotion, then he deflects: \"if I write any more truth, I'll\
    \ need a therapy co-writer credit.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** All constraints present\
    \ and accounted for. No gaps. The only minor note: the craft detail could go *deeper*.\
    \ You show the structure on the whiteboard, but you could add a line where a writer\
    \ pitches a joke using specific technique (callbacks, escalation, etc.), making\
    \ the craft more visceral and less about exposition.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Beat\
    \ Execution\n**SCORE: 0.78**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Opening Image: Marcus in writers'\
    \ room, but description emphasizes his hollowness (\"mask snapping back into place,\"\
    \ \"zero muscle engagement\"). ✓\n- Theme Stated: Jerry's line about truth in\
    \ comedy. ✓\n- Catalyst: Maya enters and immediately destabilizes the room dynamic.\
    \ ✓\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The beats *exist* but feel telescoped. The Opening Image\
    \ is strong, but you spend only ~200 words on it before moving to Theme Stated.\
    \ In Save the Cat, this beats usually has more breathing room to establish tone\
    \ and world. Expand Marcus's world slightly—show *how* the room functions before\
    \ disruption. Show one full joke workshop cycle (pitch → riff → punch-up → joke\
    \ lands). This gives the Opening Image weight before Jerry's thematic line hits\
    \ harder.\n\nAlso, the Catalyst is abrupt. Maya enters, delivers two zingers,\
    \ and we're done. Stretch the moment. Let there be awkward silence. Let Marcus\
    \ *almost* attack her. Build tension before the resolution.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION:\
    \ Industry Authenticity\n**SCORE: 0.68**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Strong details: marker\
    \ click, bare feet, lukewarm pad thai, pizza boxes, the specific naming of *City\
    \ Lights* as a show.\n- Weak spots: The banter feels slightly written-for-TV.\
    \ Real writers' rooms have more filler, more side conversations, more tangents.\n\
    \n**FEEDBACK:** The room reads like a *scene* in a TV show about writers, not\
    \ an actual writers' room. Real rooms have:\n- Overlapping dialogue (people pitching\
    \ over each other)\n- Mundane logistics interruptions (\"Studio called, they need\
    \ notes by 4\")\n- Actual joke workshopping with failed attempts and weird tangents\n\
    - Phone interruptions, production concerns bleeding in\n\nReplace Jerry's solitary\
    \ monologue about truth with a *moment* of actual writing. Have two writers pitch\
    \ competing jokes, Marcus picks one, and it's mediocre. Let us *see* the compromise\
    \ and exhaustion of the job, not just hear about it.\n\nAlso: Seven writers is\
    \ small for a network sitcom room. This might be intentional (a dying show?),\
    \ but clarify it. \"Seven of us left\" or \"skeleton crew of seven\" would ground\
    \ it.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Character Depth\n**SCORE: 0.65**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\
    - Marcus: Clear archetype (burnt-out creative). We learn: he wrote emotionally\
    \ as 22, hasn't felt joy in 3 years, uses humor as defense mechanism, wrote the\
    \ admired \"Funeral\" episode.\n- Maya: We learn: she's observant, reads people,\
    \ has old eyes despite youth, appreciative of real work.\n\n**FEEDBACK:** Both\
    \ characters are *functional* but not *dimensional*.\n\n**Marcus lacks complexity:**\
    \ He's sad, but *why* that specific sadness? Is it the industry? A personal loss?\
    \ Creative compromise? The spec script mention suggests it's about his father,\
    \ but this detail floats free—it's never integrated into his current crisis. Give\
    \ us *one* line showing what he's actually compromised on or lost. \"We were supposed\
    \ to make people *think*, and now I'm writing space heater jokes for a dying network\
    \ show\" would add context.\n\n**Maya lacks interiority:** She reads Marcus instantly,\
    \ but we don't know *her* state. Why is she there? Is she idealistic, desperate\
    \ for a job, or something else? Her line \"the clown cry\" suggests she sees truth\
    \ too—is she like 22-year-old Marcus? Make Maya a mirror for him explicitly. One\
    \ line: \"I wrote that clown bit myself—submitted it here because I thought you'd\
    \ appreciate it\" would create mutual recognition and raise stakes.\n\n**Jerry\
    \ is a plot device:** He delivers the theme and disappears. Give him one small\
    \ reaction to Maya's entrance—skepticism, recognition, annoyance—to make him a\
    \ *character* not a messenger.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Industry Authenticity (Secondary\
    \ Check)\n**SCORE: 0.68**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** The whiteboard structure is accurate\
    \ to network comedy. The reference to forced casting (\"the network had forced\
    \ on them,\" regarding Maya) reflects real politics. However, \"staff writer\"\
    \ language feels slightly off—usually it's \"junior writer\" or \"assistant.\"\
    \n\n**FEEDBACK:** Keep the specificity but add one layer of production reality.\
    \ What show are they *on*? Is it a dying network sitcom (which explains the small\
    \ room and low stakes)? Or prestige streaming (which changes everything about\
    \ the dynamic)? Right now it feels generically \"writers' room.\" Anchor it: \"\
    We had three more writers last season\" or \"Cable doesn't have the budget for\
    \ a full room anymore.\"\n\n---\n\n## OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:\n\nThis story **successfully\
    \ hits all technical requirements** and creates a compelling moment of artistic\
    \ recognition between a burnt-out mentee and an idealistic new writer. However,\
    \ it trades *depth* for *efficiency*—the beats exist but lack breathing room,\
    \ the characters are *functional archetypes* rather than three-dimensional people,\
    \ and the emotional climax arrives too quickly to land with full weight. To strengthen:\
    \ (1) Extend the Opening Image and first joke workshop to establish tone; (2)\
    \ Deepen Marcus and Maya with specific context about *why* they've compromised\
    \ or haven't; (3) Add texture to the writers' room with realistic interruptions\
    \ and failed pitches; (4) Make the Catalyst sequence longer and more tense before\
    \ Maya's penetrating observation."

  content: '"Okay, here’s the beat," Marcus Webb said, capping the dry-erase marker
    with a sharp *click*. "Dad thinks ''Netflix and chill'' is a literal suggestion
    to watch movies in a cold basement. He shows up with a space heater."


    "He needs the physical prop," Marcus continued, pacing the small room. "He’s got
    a down comforter. He’s got hot cocoa. He is fully prepared for a blizzard."


    "Does he bring slippers?" asked Dave, a junior writer picking at a slice of cold
    pizza.


    "Two pairs," Marcus said instantly. "One for him, one for the daughter."


    "Escalate it," Marcus commanded, circling the board. "What’s the button?"


    "Daughter says, ''Dad, I''m trying to have sex''?" Dave offered.


    "No, too on the nose," Marcus cut him down. "Keep it visual. Dad plugs in the
    heater, the power strips overload, the whole block goes dark. Now they’re just
    sitting in the dark. That’s the show."


    The room erupted. Seven writers in various states of dishevelment—hoodies, blazers
    over t-shirts, bare feet—howled. Marcus smiled. It was the kind of smile that
    required zero muscle engagement, just a reflexive baring of teeth. He looked at
    the whiteboard, covered in the skeletal remains of a sitcom: *Act One: The Setup*,
    *Act Two: The Complication*, *Act Three: The Lesson Nobody Learns*.


    "Great, great," Marcus said, his voice flat. "Let''s punch that up and get it
    on the board. Studio needs the pages by four."


    It was a skeleton crew now; budget cuts had claimed the rest. Marcus wrote *SPACE
    HEATER* under the ''B'' story, his hand moving with the efficiency of a machine.
    He hadn''t felt a genuine spark of joy in three years. The laughter in the room
    sounded like static to him, just white noise against the constant hum of his own
    exhaustion. He used to write to make people *think*, to bleed onto the page so
    they wouldn''t feel alone. Now he wrote space heater jokes for a dying network.


    "You know," said Jerry, the showrunner, breaking the rhythm. He wasn''t looking
    at anyone, just staring at a container of lukewarm pad thai. "A joke only lands
    if there’s a little bit of truth underneath it. If you stop caring about the truth,
    you’re just writing noise."


    Marcus stared at the word *HEATER*. The letters blurred. He thought about the
    spec script he wrote when he was twenty-two, the "Funeral" episode that made his
    name, the one that made him cry while he typed it because it was about his father
    leaving. He remembered the feeling of reaching into his chest and pulling something
    out, raw and bleeding. His throat tightened, a hot, sharp pressure building behind
    his eyes. He gripped the marker until his knuckles turned white.


    He swallowed hard, the sensation painful. He turned to the room, the mask snapping
    back into place. "Well, Jerry, if I write any more truth, I’ll need a therapy
    co-writer credit. Let''s stick to the space heater."


    The room chuckled, relieved. Marcus exhaled, the moment passing.


    The door swung open. A young woman stood there, clutching a notebook. This was
    Maya, the staff writer the network had forced on them.


    "Sorry I''m late," she said, stepping over a pile of discarded scripts. "I was
    watching a clown cry at the intersection of Hollywood and Highland. It was funnier
    than anything I saw on TV last year."


    The room went silent. Marcus looked at her, ready to crush the new girl. It was
    the rite of passage. Someone had done it to him in 1998. Someone had to do it
    to her.


    "Sit down, ''Funny Girl''", Marcus sneered, leaning back in his chair. "We’re
    working on a real show here. Clowns are for circuses."


    Maya didn''t flinch. She walked right up to the whiteboard, standing beside him.
    She didn''t look at the board; she looked at him. She scanned his face, reading
    the lines of exhaustion, the dead eyes, the forced posture of a man holding up
    a ceiling that was about to collapse.


    "I wrote that clown bit," she said quietly. "Submitted it to the open submission
    pile last year. I thought *you* would appreciate it, Marcus. You''re the one who
    taught me—well, your writing did—that pain is just a punchline we haven''t found
    yet."


    Marcus opened his mouth, the barb ready to launch, but she held up a hand.


    "You''re Marcus Webb," she said. "You wrote the ''Funeral'' episode of *City Lights*.
    It’s the only thing that made me laugh last year."


    She paused, her gaze piercing, stripping him bare. "But you don''t look like a
    guy who can write that anymore. You look like a guy who''s forgotten how to cry."


    The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. Marcus felt the static in his
    head cut out, leaving a terrifying, ringing silence. He was exposed. He wasn''t
    healed, and he wasn''t hopeful—he was just seen.'

    \n**FEEDBACK:** The room feels authentic, but one detail slightly breaks it: writers\

    \ But what's *her* wound? Why is she really here—is she just trying to break in,\
    \ or does she have a deeper connection to Marcus's work? Consider adding one small\
    \ detail about her own creative struggle or what she sacrificed to get here. This\
    \ would make the confrontation feel less like \"wise young mentor calls out broken\

    \ interrupts to eat pad thai and philosophize.\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The Catalyst (Maya's\
    \ arrival) needs slightly more setup. She should feel inevitable and surprising\
    \ simultaneously. Currently, her entrance is framed as a forced-by-network hire.\

  content: 'The squeak of the dry-erase marker was the only sound in the room for
    a heartbeat. Marcus Webb stared at the whiteboard, at the words *ACT TWO: THE
    COMPLICATION*, written in his own jagged handwriting. The room smelled of stale
    coffee and desperation. He capped the marker with a sharp *click*.


    "Okay, here’s the beat," Marcus said, his voice projecting a confidence he didn''t
    feel. "Dad thinks ''Netflix and chill'' is a literal suggestion to watch movies
    in a cold basement. He shows up with a space heater."


    "He needs the physical prop," Marcus continued, pacing the small room. "He’s got
    a down comforter. He’s got hot cocoa. He is fully prepared for a blizzard."


    "Does he bring slippers?" asked Dave, a junior writer picking at a slice of cold
    pizza.


    "Two pairs," Marcus said instantly. "One for him, one for the daughter."


    "Escalate it," Marcus commanded, circling the board. "What’s the button?"


    "Daughter says, ''Dad, I''m trying to have sex''?" Dave offered.

    heater, the power strips overload, the whole block goes dark. Now they’re just
    sitting in the dark. That’s the show."


    The room erupted. Seven writers in various states of dishevelment—hoodies, blazers
    over t-shirts, bare feet—howled. Marcus smiled. It was the kind of smile that
    required zero muscle engagement, just a reflexive baring of teeth. He looked at
    the whiteboard, covered in the skeletal remains of a sitcom. It was a skeleton
    crew now; budget cuts had claimed the rest.


    "Great, great," Marcus said, his voice flat. "Let''s punch that up and get it
    on the board. Studio needs the pages by four."


    He wrote *SPACE HEATER* under the ''B'' story, his hand moving with the efficiency
    of a machine. He hadn''t felt a genuine spark of joy in three years. The laughter
    in the room sounded like static to him, just white noise against the constant
    hum of his own exhaustion. He used to write to make people *think*, to bleed onto
    the page so they wouldn''t feel alone. Now he wrote space heater jokes for a dying
    network.


    "You know," said Jerry, the showrunner, breaking the rhythm. He wasn''t looking
    at anyone, just staring at a container of lukewarm pad thai. "It’s funny. But
    a joke only lands if there’s a little bit of truth underneath it. If you stop
    caring about the truth, you’re just writing noise."


    Marcus stared at the word *HEATER*. The letters blurred. He thought about the
    spec script he wrote when he was twenty-two, the "Funeral" episode that made his
    name, the one that made him cry while he typed it because it was about his father
    leaving. He remembered the feeling of reaching into his chest and pulling something
    out, raw and bleeding. His throat tightened, a hot, sharp pressure building behind
    his eyes. He gripped the marker until his knuckles turned white.


    He swallowed hard, the sensation painful. He turned to the room, the mask snapping
    back into place. "Well, Jerry, if I write any more truth, I’ll need a therapy
    co-writer credit. Let''s stick to the space heater."


    The room chuckled, relieved. Marcus exhaled, the moment passing.


    The door swung open. A young woman stood there, clutching a notebook so tightly
    the cover was warped. This was Maya, the staff writer the network had forced on
    them. She looked frantic, her eyes wide and rimmed with red, as if she’d been
    arguing with a parking meter.


    "Sorry I''m late," she said, stepping over a pile of discarded scripts. "I was
    watching a clown cry at the intersection of Hollywood and Highland. It was funnier
    than anything I saw on TV last year."


    The room went silent. Marcus looked at her, ready to crush the new girl. It was
    the rite of passage. Someone had done it to him in 1998. Someone had to do it
    to her.


    "Sit down, ''Funny Girl''", Marcus sneered, leaning back in his chair. "We’re
    working on a real show here. Clowns are for circuses."


    Maya didn''t flinch. She walked right up to the whiteboard, standing beside him.
    She didn''t look at the board; she looked at him. She scanned his face, reading
    the lines of exhaustion, the dead eyes, the forced posture of a man holding up
    a ceiling that was about to collapse.


    "I read your interview in *Variety* three years ago," she said, her voice trembling
    slightly. "You said comedy is just tragedy plus time. I’ve been waiting for the
    time part to kick in, but it just keeps hurting."


    She took a breath, steadying herself. "You''re Marcus Webb. You wrote the ''Funeral''
    episode of *City Lights*. It’s the only thing that made me feel less alone last
    year."


    She paused, her gaze piercing, stripping him bare. "But you don''t look like a
    guy who can write that anymore. You look like a guy who''s forgotten how to cry."


    The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. Marcus felt the static in his
    head cut out, leaving a terrifying, ringing silence. He was exposed. He wasn''t
    healed, and he wasn''t hopeful—he was just seen.'

  content: "# STORY CRITIQUE\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Emotional Complexity\n**SCORE:\
    \ 0.92**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Humor: \"One for him, one for the daughter\" and\
    \ the power strip overload bit land genuinely funny.\n- Pathos: \"He hadn't felt\
    \ a genuine spark of joy in three years. The laughter in the room sounded like\
    \ static to him.\"\n- The juxtaposition works because we *feel* the weight beneath\
    \ the joke-craft.\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The emotional arc is nearly perfect. The only\
    \ missed opportunity: when Marcus looks at the word \"*HEATER*\" and his throat\
    \ tightens, the story could linger slightly longer in that physical sensation\
    \ before the mask snaps back. Currently it moves quickly to the joke-deflection.\
    \ A single added sentence of internal resistance would deepen the moment. Example:\
    \ \"He could feel Jerry's eyes on him. He could feel the entire room waiting to\
    \ see if the skeleton would break.\"\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\n\
    **SCORE: 1.0**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n1. ✓ Laugh first: Space heater escalation (\"\
    Does he bring slippers? / Two pairs\")\n2. ✓ Theme by minor character: Jerry's\
    \ monologue (\"a joke only lands if there's a little bit of truth underneath it\"\
    )\n3. ✓ Specific craft detail: Save the Cat structure, \"Keep it visual. Dad plugs\
    \ in the heater, the power strips overload\"\n4. ✓ New writer not naive: Maya\
    \ reads his exhaustion immediately, doesn't waste time with small talk\n5. ✓ Almost-break\
    \ covered with joke: The marker grip moment → \"If I write any more truth, I'll\
    \ need a therapy co-writer credit\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** All constraints satisfied\
    \ cleanly. No improvements needed.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Beat Execution\n**SCORE:\
    \ 0.78**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Opening Image: \"Marcus Webb stared at the whiteboard...\
    \ a skeleton crew now; budget cuts had claimed the rest\" ✓\n- Theme Stated: Jerry's\
    \ pad thai moment ✓\n- Catalyst: \"The door swung open. A young woman stood there,\
    \ clutching a notebook\" ✓\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The beats are present but *compressed*.\
    \ The Opening Image and Theme Stated are only 3-4 paragraphs apart, which can\
    \ feel rushed. Consider expanding the Opening Image section by 1-2 paragraphs\
    \ to establish Marcus's hollowness more viscerally before Jerry speaks. Currently,\
    \ the story jumps from \"skeleton crew\" → Marcus's internal monologue → Jerry's\
    \ interruption in quick succession. Breathing room would strengthen the structure.\
    \ For example, add a moment where Marcus interacts with another writer before\
    \ Jerry speaks, showing his autopilot mode in action.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION:\
    \ Industry Authenticity\n**SCORE: 0.88**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- \"Studio needs the\
    \ pages by four\" (real pressure)\n- \"cold pizza,\" \"hoodies, blazers over t-shirts,\
    \ bare feet\" (lived-in detail)\n- \"Someone had done it to him in 1998. Someone\
    \ had to do it to her.\" (genuine hazing culture)\n- Save the Cat structure name-dropped\
    \ naturally, not pedantically\n- The specific tension of \"too on the nose\" vs.\
    \ \"visual\" joke-craft\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The room feels authentic with one caveat:\
    \ the dialogue is slightly *too* clean. Real writers' rooms have more crosstalk,\
    \ interruptions, and tangents. (\"No, wait—\" / \"Hold on—\"). Consider adding\
    \ 2-3 moments of overlapping speech to increase verisimilitude. Also, the \"Funny\
    \ Girl\" line from Marcus feels slightly theatrical for a burnt-out showrunner.\
    \ Would he really use a nickname that quickly? Consider: \"Sit down,\" Marcus\
    \ said flatly. \"We're working on a space heater problem.\" (Subtler, meaner,\
    \ more real.)\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Character Depth\n**SCORE: 0.81**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\
    \n**Marcus:**\n- Specificity: \"He remembered the feeling of reaching into his\
    \ chest and pulling something out, raw and bleeding\" (we know *why* he's hollow—not\
    \ just burnt out, but specifically creatively compromised)\n- Contradiction: He\
    \ performs confidence while feeling none; the gap is visible\n- BUT: He's largely\
    \ reactive in this scene. We see him *through* exhaustion, not through active\
    \ choices\n\n**Maya:**\n- She pierces his armor immediately, which is good, but\
    \ her depth comes from one monologue. \n- We learn: She watched his old work,\
    \ felt alone, recognizes his pattern\n- BUT: Her own wound isn't revealed. Why\
    \ was *she* alone? What's her stake?\n\n**FEEDBACK:** \n\n*For Marcus:* Give him\
    \ one active choice that contradicts his exhaustion, something that shows us the\
    \ person underneath still exists. Currently, every action is mechanized (capping\
    \ the marker, pacing, writing on the board, deflecting). Add: a moment where he\
    \ *almost* gives the new writer real feedback before catching himself. Example:\
    \ He could start to engage with her observation, then stop himself, realizing\
    \ engagement is dangerous.\n\n*For Maya:* The final monologue is strong, but it\
    \ tells us about Marcus's weakness, not her strength. What does *she* want from\
    \ this job? Is she running from something, or running toward something? One line\
    \ revealing her own creative wound would make her peer-like rather than antagonistic.\
    \ Example: \"I read your interview because I was drowning, and I thought maybe\
    \ someone who'd written something that true could teach me how.\" (She's not just\
    \ calling him out; she's also vulnerable.)\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Industry Authenticity\
    \ (Secondary)\n**SCORE: 0.85**\n\n**FEEDBACK ON TECHNICAL ELEMENTS:**\n- The phrase\
    \ *ACT TWO: THE COMPLICATION* is correct structure language ✓\n- The *Variety*\
    \ interview callback feels earned, not contrived ✓\n- The power strip overload\
    \ as a visual payoff is authentic joke-crafting ✓\n\n**Minor note:** Most modern\
    \ writers' rooms would be working on laptops/tablets, not staring at a whiteboard\
    \ so intensely. The whiteboard works thematically (visible emptiness, skeleton\
    \ of ideas), but acknowledge the anachronism by explaining *why* they're whiteboarding.\
    \ (\"The network banned Slack after the leak last month; analog it is.\") This\
    \ increases authenticity via specificity.\n\n---\n\n## OVERALL ASSESSMENT\n\n\
    This is a strong story that balances humor and heartbreak effectively while satisfying\
    \ all technical constraints. Marcus's hollow competence and Maya's laser-focused\
    \ empathy create genuine tension. The story's primary weakness is *compression*—the\
    \ beats are present but underexplored, and both characters could gain depth by\
    \ revealing their own creative wounds rather than solely observing each other's\
    \ failure. Adding 200-300 words to expand the Opening Image and deepen Maya's\
    \ stakes would elevate this from \"very good\" to \"exceptional.\""

    \ Marcus exhaled, the moment passing.\n\nThe door swung open. A young woman stood\

    a heartbeat. Marcus Webb stared at the whiteboard, at the words *ACT TWO: THE
    COMPLICATION*, written in his own jagged handwriting. The room smelled of stale
    coffee and desperation.


    "Network banned screens after the pilot leak," Dave muttered from the couch, tossing
    a balled-up napkin into a trash can. He missed. "Analog only. Feels like 1998."


    "1998 was cheaper," Marcus said, capping the marker with a sharp *click*. He didn''t
    look at Dave. He didn''t look at anyone. He just looked at the board. "Okay, here’s
    the beat. Dad thinks ''Netflix and chill'' is a literal suggestion to watch movies
    in a cold basement. He shows up with a space heater."


    "He needs the physical prop," Marcus continued, pacing the small room. "He’s got
    a down comforter. He’s got hot cocoa. He is fully prepared for a blizzard."


    "Does he bring slippers?" asked Dave, picking at a slice of cold pizza.


    "Two pairs," Marcus said instantly. "One for him, one for the daughter."


    "Wait, wait—" interrupted a junior writer in the corner. "If he brings two pairs,
    he knows she''s cold. That''s caring."


    "It''s smothering," Marcus shot back, circling the board. "Escalate it. What’s

    "Daughter says, ''Dad, I''m trying to have sex''?" Dave offered.


    "No, too on the nose," Marcus cut him down. "Keep it visual. Dad plugs in the

    He could feel the room holding its breath, waiting for the skeleton to finally
    collapse under the weight of its own ribs. He swallowed hard, the sensation painful.
    He turned to the room, the mask snapping back into place.


    "Well, Jerry, if I write any more truth, I’ll need a therapy co-writer credit.
    Let''s stick to the space heater."


    The room chuckled, relieved. Marcus exhaled, the moment passing.


    The door swung open. A young woman stood there, clutching a notebook so tightly
    the cover was warped. This was Maya, the staff writer the network had forced on
    them. She looked frantic, her eyes wide and rimmed with red, as if she’d been

    She took a breath, steadying herself, revealing the desperation underneath her
    composure. "I read it because I was drowning, and I thought maybe someone who
    wrote something that true could teach me how to swim."


    She paused, her gaze piercing, stripping him bare. "You''re Marcus Webb. You wrote

    "But you don''t look like a guy who can write that anymore," she whispered. "You
    look like a guy who''s forgotten how to cry."


    The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. Marcus felt the static in his
    head cut out, leaving a terrifying, ringing silence. He was exposed. He wasn''t
    healed, and he wasn''t hopeful—he was just seen.'

  Marcus Webb stared at the whiteboard, at the words *ACT TWO: THE COMPLICATION*,
  written in his own jagged handwriting. The room smelled of stale coffee and desperation.


  "Network banned screens after the pilot leak," Dave muttered from the couch, tossing
  a balled-up napkin into a trash can. He missed. "Analog only. Feels like 1998."


  "1998 was cheaper," Marcus said, capping the marker with a sharp *click*. He didn''t
  look at Dave. He didn''t look at anyone. He just looked at the board. "Okay, here’s
  the beat. Dad thinks ''Netflix and chill'' is a literal suggestion to watch movies
  in a cold basement. He shows up with a space heater."


  "He needs the physical prop," Marcus continued, pacing the small room. "He’s got
  a down comforter. He’s got hot cocoa. He is fully prepared for a blizzard."


  "Does he bring slippers?" asked Dave, picking at a slice of cold pizza.


  "Two pairs," Marcus said instantly. "One for him, one for the daughter."


  "Wait, wait—" interrupted a junior writer in the corner. "If he brings two pairs,
  he knows she''s cold. That''s caring."


  "It''s smothering," Marcus shot back, circling the board. "Escalate it. What’s the
  button?"


  "Daughter says, ''Dad, I''m trying to have sex''?" Dave offered.


  "No, too on the nose," Marcus cut him down. "Keep it visual. Dad plugs in the heater,
  the power strips overload, the whole block goes dark. Now they’re just sitting in
  the dark. That’s the show."


  The room erupted. Seven writers in various states of dishevelment—hoodies, blazers
  over t-shirts, bare feet—howled. Marcus smiled. It was the kind of smile that required
  zero muscle engagement, just a reflexive baring of teeth. It was a skeleton crew
  now; budget cuts had claimed the rest.


  "Great, great," Marcus said, his voice flat. "Let''s punch that up and get it on
  the board. Studio needs the pages by four."


  He wrote *SPACE HEATER* under the ''B'' story, his hand moving with the efficiency
  of a machine. He hadn''t felt a genuine spark of joy in three years. The laughter
  in the room sounded like static to him, just white noise against the constant hum
  of his own exhaustion. He used to write to make people *think*, to bleed onto the
  page so they wouldn''t feel alone. Now he wrote space heater jokes for a dying network.


  "You know," said Jerry, the showrunner, breaking the rhythm. He wasn''t looking
  at anyone, just staring at a container of lukewarm pad thai. "It’s funny. But a
  joke only lands if there’s a little bit of truth underneath it. If you stop caring
  about the truth, you’re just writing noise."


  Marcus stared at the word *HEATER*. The letters blurred. He thought about the spec
  script he wrote when he was twenty-two, the "Funeral" episode that made his name,
  the one that made him cry while he typed it because it was about his father leaving.
  He remembered the feeling of reaching into his chest and pulling something out,
  raw and bleeding. His throat tightened, a hot, sharp pressure building behind his
  eyes. He gripped the marker until his knuckles turned white.


  He could feel the room holding its breath, waiting for the skeleton to finally collapse
  under the weight of its own ribs. He swallowed hard, the sensation painful. He turned
  to the room, the mask snapping back into place.


  "Well, Jerry, if I write any more truth, I’ll need a therapy co-writer credit. Let''s
  stick to the space heater."


  The room chuckled, relieved. Marcus exhaled, the moment passing.


  The door swung open. A young woman stood there, clutching a notebook so tightly
  the cover was warped. This was Maya, the staff writer the network had forced on
  them. She looked frantic, her eyes wide and rimmed with red, as if she’d been arguing
  with a parking meter.


  "Sorry I''m late," she said, stepping over a pile of discarded scripts. "I was watching
  a clown cry at the intersection of Hollywood and Highland. It was funnier than anything
  I saw on TV last year."


  The room went silent. Marcus looked at her, ready to crush the new girl. It was
  the rite of passage. Someone had done it to him in 1998. Someone had to do it to
  her.


  "Sit down," Marcus said, not looking up from the board. "We’re working on a space
  heater problem."


  Maya didn''t move. She walked right up to the whiteboard, standing beside him. She
  didn''t look at the board; she looked at him. She scanned his face, reading the
  lines of exhaustion, the dead eyes, the forced posture of a man holding up a ceiling
  that was about to collapse.


  "I read your interview in *Variety* three years ago," she said, her voice trembling
  slightly. "You said comedy is just tragedy plus time. I’ve been waiting for the
  time part to kick in, but it just keeps hurting."


  She took a breath, steadying herself, revealing the desperation underneath her composure.
  "I read it because I was drowning, and I thought maybe someone who wrote something
  that true could teach me how to swim."


  She paused, her gaze piercing, stripping him bare. "You''re Marcus Webb. You wrote
  the ''Funeral'' episode of *City Lights*. It’s the only thing that made me feel
  less alone last year."


  "But you don''t look like a guy who can write that anymore," she whispered. "You
  look like a guy who''s forgotten how to cry."


  The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. Marcus felt the static in his
  head cut out, leaving a terrifying, ringing silence. He was exposed. He wasn''t
  healed, and he wasn''t hopeful—he was just seen.'
