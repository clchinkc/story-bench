  evidence: Each revision increases sensory specificity and narrative clarity. V0
    opens with a strong auditory hook but is truncated and relatively abstract. V1
    adds tactile detail (vibration through chair legs) and smells (empanadas), improving
    non-visual grounding. V2 tightens phrasing and intensifies the sensory language.
    V3 and the final version introduce concrete characters (Mr. Dario), distinctive
    audio motifs (the cart bell 'k-kink', trumpet half-step), and crucially the three-note
    chirp that becomes the investigative audio clue; they also expand the plot (voicemail,
    detective, threatening email, knock at the door) and execute the 'Fun and Games'
    podcast segment before it turns menacing. Good elements from earlier versions
    (the neighborhood-as-character hook, Imani’s audio craft) are preserved and amplified.
    Overall the story moves from a promising sensory fragment to a coherent, tense
    scene that meets all given constraints, with only minor room for tightening prose
    and pacing.
