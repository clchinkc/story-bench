  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Isolation is masterfully shown through behavioral specifics
    (unread messages swiped away, dead plant, eating alone, empty lecture hall, self-talk).
    The alien signal genuinely feels alien—gravitational fluctuations, evolving patterns,
    recursive structure—avoiding anthropomorphism. Samuel Okonkwo effectively challenges
    Yuki''s emotional approach with data-driven pragmatism. Marcus is unconventional
    as mentor (maintenance engineer, jazz musician, philosophical rather than authoritative).
    The psychological threshold is clear: Yuki must move from pattern-recognition
    to empathy-recognition. The human connection moment (Emi''s grief) surprises Yuki
    and the reader, forcing genuine vulnerability. All four beats execute cleanly:
    Call (hologram summons), Refusal (wanting to work remotely, retreating to quarters),
    Mentor (Marcus''s pipe-fixing wisdom), Threshold (recognizing gaps as empathetic
    waiting). MINOR GAPS: The ''alien signal feels like mourning'' intuition could
    be more grounded earlier—it emerges somewhat suddenly in the climax. The plan
    mentions ''predate its own transmission'' complexity that doesn''t fully resolve
    in output. Samuel''s challenge could have one more confrontation to deepen tension.
    The connection between Yuki''s mother''s message and the alien signal''s empathetic
    demand is elegant but slightly compressed. EXECUTION: Output exceeds plan in emotional
    resonance while maintaining structural fidelity. Pacing is excellent. The final
    revelation that aliens seek *remembrance* rather than *translation* reframes the
    entire narrative. Yuki''s arc from intellectual isolation to emotional communion
    is earned, not imposed.'
