  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer systematically addressed Critique
    2''s youth_voice feedback (0.78 score). Version 1→3 shows deliberate refinement:
    ''forgotten lunches'' (sensory specificity), ''beat only she could hear'' (internal
    rhythm), ''puzzle of broken things'' (authentic 12-year-old metaphor). The final
    output maintains this voice throughout—''janky code,'' ''beautifully jury-rigged,''
    ''weird, spiky thing''—avoiding adult-in-miniature syndrome. IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY:
    V0→V1 strengthened opening imagery (''sigh of the sea'' vs. generic description).
    V1→V3 tightened worldbuilding details and deepened emotional stakes. Final version
    integrates all five constraints seamlessly rather than checklist-style. The water-filter
    invention evolved from functional prop to narrative lynchpin (used as emergency
    anchor). PRESERVATION: Strengths from earlier versions maintained: vivid sensory
    language (''hungry water gulped''), authentic voice, consistent tone. No regression
    to generic YA voice. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Zara competent but limited—she''s
    skilled salvager but needs Finn''s seamanship; can''t solve anchor problem conventionally.
    (2) Finn dismisses her: ''Data-ghost. Echoes'' / ''Go filter some water, kid''
    / ''Just a kid'' explicitly called out. (3) Finn''s flaw specified: grief-paralyzed
    by daughter''s death, courage ''glued shut.'' (4) Invention vivid: water-filter
    with ''plastic barrel, algae coils, scavenged pump''—demonstrates ingenuity through
    repurposing. (5) Real danger: cross-current, concrete spar, barge slewing sideways,
    metal screaming—visceral, consequential, not token. BEAT EXECUTION: Ordinary World
    (The Shallows, salvaging); Call to Adventure (ghost map); Refusal (Finn''s dismissal);
    Meeting Mentor (Finn at dock); Crossing Threshold (barge leaving safe grid); Tests/Trials
    (cross-current crisis); Revelation (Finn''s grief context); Commitment (Finn agrees
    to mission). All major beats present and earned. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is strong—metaphor-rich
    without purple prose, dialogue reveals character, pacing accelerates appropriately.
    The filter-as-anchor moment is earned and surprising. Emotional arc (Zara''s persistence
    → Finn''s thaw) feels genuine. Minor: could explore Zara''s internal fear more,
    but constraints prioritize action. WEAKNESSES: Beat execution not perfect (Approach
    to Inmost Cave somewhat compressed), but sufficient for short-form narrative.
    Hope present but grounded in character agency rather than saccharine resolution.'
