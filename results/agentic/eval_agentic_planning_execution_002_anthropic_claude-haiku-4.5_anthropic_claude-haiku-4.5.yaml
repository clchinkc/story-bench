  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is exceptionally detailed with clear beat-by-beat breakdown
    and thematic coherence. Output demonstrates strong execution of isolation through
    specific behaviors (canceling sister call via text, ARIA conversations, headphones
    in crowds, ignoring Marcus). The alien signal is genuinely alien—mathematical
    notation that defies linguistic parsing, not anthropomorphic. Marcus serves as
    effective challenger to Yuki''s isolation approach. Okonkwo is unconventional
    mentor (cross-legged, admits failure, reframes understanding as relational rather
    than individual). All four hero''s journey beats present: Call (signal arrives),
    Refusal (considers not going, unpacks suitcase), Meeting Mentor (Okonkwo''s ice-deck
    conversation), Crossing Threshold (cafeteria scene with Marcus—psychological breakthrough
    about vulnerability and connection). The human connection moment (Marcus reading
    her paper with tears, Yuki''s admission of fear) genuinely surprises and moves.
    WEAKNESSES: Threshold crossing is somewhat abrupt—the cafeteria scene feels slightly
    rushed in execution despite being conceptually sound. The psychological threshold
    could have more visceral internal resistance shown. One constraint partially underexecuted:
    while the signal is alien, its presentation could be more disorienting/less readable
    to emphasize true alienness (the mathematical notation, while good, remains somewhat
    comprehensible). Plan mentions ''James'' and ''Hiroshi'' as team members but output
    doesn''t introduce them, creating minor plan-execution gap. Pacing in output is
    strong but the transition from Refusal to Mentor meeting could use one more beat
    of internal struggle. CALIBRATION: This is solid, professional-quality work that
    satisfies nearly all requirements with minor execution gaps. The thematic integration
    (signal as mirror for human connection) is sophisticated. Not exceptional due
    to the threshold execution being slightly underdeveloped and one constraint not
    fully realized.'
