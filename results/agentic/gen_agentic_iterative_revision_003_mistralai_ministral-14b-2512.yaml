  content: '**"El Camino"**


    The desert sun hung heavy over the strip mall parking lot, melting the edges of
    Mateo’s *guayabera* shirt. His father had bought it for him last Christmas, the
    embroidered *M* on the pocket a silent reminder: *Mijo, tú eres el responsable.*
    At sixteen, Mateo had already memorized the script—after school, he’d translate
    for Abuela at the clinic, then swing by the *mom & pop* grocery to restock the
    pantry. No weekends off. No excuses.


    That afternoon, he found his cousin Leo waiting by the *tienda* in a stolen pair
    of his older brother’s boots, the laces untied. "Vamos," Leo said, tossing a crumpled
    flyer onto the hood of Mateo’s beat-up Honda. *"Fiesta en el desierto. Nadie pregunta."*


    Mateo’s stomach twisted. The flyer advertised a party at the old *rancho* past
    the border fence—no parents, no rules. Just music and smoke and the kind of freedom
    that tasted like rebellion. His fingers curled around the paper. "My car’s not
    going that far."


    Leo smirked. "Then walk. Or stay here and keep playing *el hijo perfecto*."


    ---


    The weight of the choice pressed on Mateo like the heat. He thought of his grandmother’s
    hands, gnarled from years of kneading *pan de muerto*, the way she’d press his
    palm against her chest when he was small and say, *"Aquí late tu futuro."* His
    future was supposed to be a scholarship, a white-collar job, a life where he never
    had to explain himself. But for the first time, he wondered what it would feel
    like to just *be*—not the translator, not the errand-runner, not the boy who carried
    the family’s hopes like a second backpack.


    That evening, Abuela found him staring at the flyer, still clutched in his fist.
    She didn’t scold him. Instead, she pulled him onto her lap and unwrapped a *churro*
    from the oven, the sugar dusting his fingers. "¿Qué pasa, mijo?" she asked, her
    voice rough but kind.


    Mateo swallowed. "I don’t know what I want to be."


    Abuela’s eyes crinkled. "You think I knew at sixteen? I thought I’d marry young,
    have many children, live in a house with a garden. Instead, I crossed a desert
    to give you one." She tapped his chest. "The heart doesn’t always follow the plan.
    But it *always* knows what it needs."


    ---


    The next morning, Mateo drove to the party—not because he wanted to, but because
    he needed to. The music pulsed through his ribs as he stood at the edge of the
    crowd, sweating under the stars. Leo clapped him on the back. "Took you long enough."


    Mateo shook his head. "I’m not here to party."


    A girl with a *rebozo* tied over her hair raised an eyebrow. "Then why’d you come?"


    "To figure out what I *am* here for."


    She studied him, then nodded toward the fence. "Your abuela used to say the desert
    doesn’t give answers. It just shows you the questions."


    Mateo exhaled. For the first time, he let himself imagine a future that wasn’t
    a checklist. Maybe college wasn’t the only path. Maybe responsibility didn’t mean
    erasing himself.


    ---


    By sundown, he was back in his car, the flyer torn into pieces. He didn’t tell
    his parents about the party. Instead, he stopped by the *tienda* and stocked the
    shelves himself—no notes, no reminders. Just because he *chose* to.


    That night, Abuela handed him a folded *rebozo*. "For when you’re ready to cross
    something new."


    Mateo kissed her cheek. "I’m ready now."


    She smiled. "Then walk light, *mi corazón*."'

    **"The Weight of the Guayabera"**


    The desert sun pressed down like a thumb on Mateo’s shoulders as he parked the
    Honda in the cracked asphalt lot behind the *tienda*, his father’s old guayabera
    sticking to his back. The embroidered *M* on his chest pocket—*Mateo* in swirling
    red thread—was a reminder he didn’t need. He adjusted the collar, already knowing
    what came next: English/Spanish test prep for Abuela’s doctor appointment, then
    the grocery run, *las compras* for the week scribbled on a napkin in his pocket.
    No weekends, no detours. Just the three-hour shift at the clinic, the four-hour
    shift at the store, and the bus ride home where the air conditioning felt like
    a luxury he wasn’t allowed to enjoy until the chores were done.


    That’s how he’d spent every summer since he turned twelve.


    Leo was leaning against the Honda’s bumper when Mateo locked up, his own guayabera
    rolled into his backpack like a dirty rag. "Otra vez, *el responsable*?" Leo said,
    grinning. He tossed a beer-stained flyer onto the driver’s seat. *"Fiesta de los
    Vasquez—pas la cerca. Mañana. No hay consecuencias."*


    Mateo’s jaw tightened. The flyer showed a faded photo of a half-collapsed *rancho*
    beyond the border fence, the kind of place that didn’t have running water but
    did have music blaring loud enough to shake the cactus. *No hay consecuencias.*
    Leo didn’t get it. There were always consequences. The last time Leo had crossed
    the fence, his mother had spent an afternoon praying over him at the altar. The
    time before that, his father had made him scrub the walls of the *tienda* with
    bleach for a week.


    Mateo pocketed the napkin, then the flyer. "My car’s not going that far."


    Leo pushed off the bumper, stepping close. "Then walk. Or stay here and let your
    abuela keep crying when she talks about Mexico like it’s a ghost."


    The words stung. Mateo didn’t want to think about Abuela’s quiet grief, the way
    she’d stare at the photograph of her mother on the dresser and recite the names
    of her siblings like a rosary, always ending with *"pero ellos se quedaron allá."*
    But Leo was right—she *did* cry sometimes. And maybe, just maybe, if Mateo disappeared
    into the desert for one night, she wouldn’t miss him.


    ---


    He spent the afternoon at the clinic, translating the doctor’s questions for Abuela,
    then the pharmacist’s answers back to her. When she nodded at the prescription,
    Mateo exhaled. One more task. One more thing he was good at.


    But as he left, she caught his arm. "Mateo. *El niño bueno*."


    He froze. "I—"


    She shook her head. "No me digas tú eres otro. Sé quién eres." Her voice was rough,
    but her grip was firm. "Pero dime, *¿qué quieres tú?*"


    He didn’t have an answer. Not one his parents or teachers or even the doctor would
    accept.


    ---


    That night, Mateo sat on the hood of his car, the flyer still in his hands. The
    desert stretched out, dark and endless, the Vasquez rancho just a smudge of light
    past the fence. He could hear the music. Leo would be there. And for the first
    time, Mateo wondered what would happen if he *let go*—of the napkin, of the expectations,
    of the weight of the guayabera pressing down on his chest like a second skin.


    He unfolded the flyer and stared at the blurred words. *No hay consecuencias.*


    Then his phone buzzed. His mother’s name lit up the screen. "Mateo," she said
    without greeting. "Your abuela’s fever is back. The doctor said it might be *mal
    de ojo* again. You know how to translate for her, *mi niño.*"


    Mateo’s thumb hovered over the screen. He could say no. He could say he was tired.
    He could say—


    But the words wouldn’t come. Leo’s voice echoed in his head. *"Pas la cerca. No
    hay consecuencias."*


    Instead, he stood. "Estoy en camino."


    The moment the words left his mouth, the guayabera felt tighter. He reached for
    it, his fingers brushing the embroidered *M*—not like a reminder, but like a question.
    *¿Qué quieres tú?*


    For the first time, he realized he didn’t know. But maybe that was the beginning.'

    **"El Calor y la Cuenta"**


    Mateo killed the Honda’s engine and sat for a second, letting the heat of the
    cab press against his skin. The air smelled like burned oil and the stale *horchata*
    his abuela had left sweating in the car—she’d forgotten it again, the third time
    this month. He pulled out the napkin with *las compras* scribbled in his mother’s
    looping cursive: *harina, azúcar, sal, y las papas que él dijo que eran blancas.*
    His fingers traced the list. Another chore. Another thing he had to fix.


    The bell above the *tienda* door chimed as Leo ducked inside, already shoving
    the guayabera their uncle had given him last Christmas into Mateo’s hands. "Póntelo,
    *primo*." His voice was sharp, but not unkind. "Tu papá ya está preguntando por
    qué no traes el dinero hoy. Otra vez."


    Mateo grunted, tying the sleeves. The embroidered *M* on his pocket itched. He’d
    worn it all week, even though the humidity made the fabric cling like a second
    skin. His uncle had pressed it into his hands Saturday morning, saying, *"Para
    que la gente sepa que eres parte de la familia, no solo el que ayuda."* Part of
    the family. The family that expected him to be the one who counted the change,
    who reminded his abuela to turn off the stove, who showed up at *la tienda* every
    damn afternoon so his dad didn’t have to—*porque el otro está en la escuela.*


    Mateo’s phone buzzed. His brother, Carlos, texting: *Mateo, ven a la casa. Ayer
    compré las cosas malas otra vez y la mami está enojada. Y no, no se me olvidó
    el pan.*


    He exhaled through his nose, opening the door. The heat hit him like a slap—same
    as always. But Leo was still blocking the way, holding out a crumpled flyer for
    *La Quince de la Tía Rosa.* *"Vasquez rancho. Pas la cerca. Mañana. Nadie pregunta."*


    Mateo stared at the faded print. A party. Past the fence. Where nobody would ask
    if he’d restocked the shelves or if his abuela had taken her medicine. Where nobody
    would call him *el responsable* like it was a job title instead of a warning.
    His uncle’s words echoed: *parte de la familia.*


    Leo nudged the flyer closer. "Vamos. Solo una noche. Nadie te va a culpar por
    esto."


    Mateo’s throat tightened. He thought of the way his uncle had handed him the guayabera—*para
    que la gente sepa*—and the way his dad looked at him when he came in after school:
    like Mateo was the only thing holding the place together. Like if Mateo slipped
    up for one second, the whole damn world would fall apart.


    He reached into his pocket and pulled out the flyer. Then the napkin. Then his
    paycheck stub from the store, still rolled up tight where his mom had slipped
    it in his wallet. *$128. No olvides lo que tu tío te dijo. Necesitamos el dinero.*


    Leo’s grin faltered. "—Oye. No me digas que—"


    Mateo shook his head. "No."


    ---


    That evening, Mateo helped his abuela at the kitchen table, setting out the *pan
    de elote* she’d made for supper. She’d burned the corners, like she always did
    when she was distracted. Like she always was these days.


    She stopped mid-slice, her wrinkled fingers pausing over the corn tortilla. "¿Qué
    pasa, *mijo*? ¿No tienes hambre?"


    Mateo swallowed. "Tío Carlos no va a la fiesta mañana."


    Abuela’s eyes flicked to his. "Ah. Pero tú *sí* quieres ir."


    "Not really."


    She laughed, a dry, grainy sound. "Soñadora. Always thinking I knew what I wanted
    at tu edad." She took a bite, then wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.
    "Your papá—he says I’m too soft with you. That you need to know the weight of
    being *responsable.*"


    Mateo’s stomach twisted. He’d heard that before. Not just from his dad, but from
    his uncle, his teachers, even the guy at the store who said, *"You’re the only
    one who shows up on time, kid."* But from his abuela? That felt different.


    She reached out, her calloused hand gripping his wrist. Not like a reprimand,
    but like—like she was trying to pull something out of him. "But I see you, *mi
    niño.* Even when you’re not looking."


    Mateo’s voice was barely a whisper. "I don’t know what I want."


    Abuela’s grip tightened just a little. "Then maybe it’s time you figured that
    out." She released him, slicing another piece of *pan.* "Just don’t let the weight
    crush you. *¿Entiendes?*"


    Mateo nodded.


    ---


    The next morning, Mateo stood in front of the *tienda*, the guayabera rolled up
    in his backpack. He’d worn his plain white tee instead, the same one his uncle
    had bought him for *La Quince de la Tía Rosa* last year—before he knew what it
    really meant. Before he understood that *ser parte de la familia* wasn’t just
    about showing up. It was about showing up *para ti.*


    His dad clapped him on the shoulder, the keys to the store jingling. "Hoy es tu
    turno. No olvides—"


    "I know," Mateo said. His voice wasn’t sharp, wasn’t defiant. Just steady. For
    the first time, he *chose* it.


    His dad blinked, then nodded. "Bien. Necesitamos el dinero."


    Mateo unrolled the napkin, then the paycheck stub. He handed both to his dad.
    "Toma. Yo me quedo con las cuentas."


    The keys stopped jingling. His uncle stared at him, then at the guayabera in Mateo’s
    backpack. "¿Yo—yo qué?"


    Mateo looked at his uncle, then at his abuela’s hands, still dusted with cornmeal,
    still kneading her own future into something soft and warm. "Tú no vas a necesidad
    de traducir mañana. Yo sí."


    Leo’s grin was back, but this time, it didn’t sting. His dad just shook his head,
    laughing. "Ay, *mijo.* ¿Qué voy a hacer contigo?"


    Mateo tied the guayabera around his waist, letting the weight sit there like a
    question instead of an answer. He took a deep breath, the desert heat pressing
    in. "No sé."


    But for the first time, he was ready to find out.'

    The Honda’s engine sputtered as Mateo pulled into the driveway, the late afternoon
    sun turning the windshield into a mirror of his own tired face. His abuela’s voice
    carried through the open window before he even turned off the car: *"¡Ay, Dios
    mío! ¿Dónde está mi receta? ¡La dejé en la mesa!"*


    Mateo groaned, grabbing the crumpled *receta* from the passenger seat where she’d
    tossed it that morning. He’d already been to the pharmacy, the grocery store,
    and the clinic—all before school let out. The napkin with *las compras* was still
    in his pocket, the ink smudged from handling it too many times.


    Inside, the house smelled like *canela* and old wood. His abuela stood at the
    stove, stirring something that looked suspiciously like *arroz con pollo* again—*el
    plato favorito de tu papá*, she’d say, even though his dad hadn’t eaten it in
    years. She turned at the sound of the door, her hands still on the spoon. *"Ah,
    por fin. Tu tío está enojado porque no llegaste a tiempo a la tienda."*


    Mateo set the recipe down. "Carlos no va a llegar. Dijo que se quedó sin gasolina."


    Abuela’s eyes flicked to his face, sharp as broken glass. *"Y tú, ¿qué hiciste?"*


    "I did everything." His voice came out raw. "The pharmacy, the store, the clinic—"


    *"Sí, sí, lo sé."* She wiped her hands on her apron, the one with the faded *Virgen
    de Guadalupe* embroidered in the corner. *"Pero dime, Mateo. ¿Qué hiciste por
    ti?"*


    He opened his mouth, then closed it. The question hung between them, heavier than
    the humidity outside.


    ---


    That night, Mateo sat on the edge of his bed, the flyer for *La Quince de la Tía
    Rosa* spread out on his lap. *Vasquez rancho. Pas la cerca. Mañana.* No consequences.
    No expectations. Just music and *cerveza* and the kind of night where nobody would
    ask if he’d remembered to lock the *tienda* or if his abuela had taken her medicine.


    His phone buzzed. A text from Leo: *Vamos, primo. No seas *miedo*.*


    Mateo stared at the screen. He could go. He could disappear into the desert for
    one night and pretend, just for a little while, that he wasn’t *el responsable*.
    That he wasn’t the one who held the family together.


    But then he thought of his abuela’s hands, still red from stirring the pot, still
    moving like they were trying to hold onto something she’d lost a long time ago.
    He thought of the way she’d looked at him today—not with anger, but with something
    worse. *Understanding.*


    He picked up the flyer and tore it in half.


    ---


    The next morning, Mateo stood in the *tienda*, his uncle’s guayabera rolled up
    in his backpack. His dad was already behind the counter, counting the day’s receipts,
    his forehead creased with the kind of worry that had been there since Mateo could
    remember.


    *"Hoy es tu turno,"* his dad said without looking up. *"No falles."*


    Mateo swallowed. "I’m not falling. I’m just—" He hesitated. *"I’m staying here."*


    His dad finally looked at him, his dark eyes searching Mateo’s face like he was
    trying to find something he’d lost. *"¿Qué pasa, hijo?"*


    Mateo thought of his abuela’s question. *¿'

  The Honda’s engine sputtered as Mateo pulled into the driveway, the late afternoon
  sun turning the windshield into a mirror of his own tired face. His abuela’s voice
  carried through the open window before he even turned off the car: *"¡Ay, Dios mío!
  ¿Dónde está mi receta? ¡La dejé en la mesa!"*


  Mateo groaned, grabbing the crumpled *receta* from the passenger seat where she’d
  tossed it that morning. He’d already been to the pharmacy, the grocery store, and
  the clinic—all before school let out. The napkin with *las compras* was still in
  his pocket, the ink smudged from handling it too many times.


  Inside, the house smelled like *canela* and old wood. His abuela stood at the stove,
  stirring something that looked suspiciously like *arroz con pollo* again—*el plato
  favorito de tu papá*, she’d say, even though his dad hadn’t eaten it in years. She
  turned at the sound of the door, her hands still on the spoon. *"Ah, por fin. Tu
  tío está enojado porque no llegaste a tiempo a la tienda."*


  Mateo set the recipe down. "Carlos no va a llegar. Dijo que se quedó sin gasolina."


  Abuela’s eyes flicked to his face, sharp as broken glass. *"Y tú, ¿qué hiciste?"*


  "I did everything." His voice came out raw. "The pharmacy, the store, the clinic—"


  *"Sí, sí, lo sé."* She wiped her hands on her apron, the one with the faded *Virgen
  de Guadalupe* embroidered in the corner. *"Pero dime, Mateo. ¿Qué hiciste por ti?"*


  He opened his mouth, then closed it. The question hung between them, heavier than
  the humidity outside.

  That night, Mateo sat on the edge of his bed, the flyer for *La Quince de la Tía
  Rosa* spread out on his lap. *Vasquez rancho. Pas la cerca. Mañana.* No consequences.
  No expectations. Just music and *cerveza* and the kind of night where nobody would
  ask if he’d remembered to lock the *tienda* or if his abuela had taken her medicine.


  His phone buzzed. A text from Leo: *Vamos, primo. No seas *miedo*.*


  Mateo stared at the screen. He could go. He could disappear into the desert for
  one night and pretend, just for a little while, that he wasn’t *el responsable*.
  That he wasn’t the one who held the family together.


  But then he thought of his abuela’s hands, still red from stirring the pot, still
  moving like they were trying to hold onto something she’d lost a long time ago.
  He thought of the way she’d looked at him today—not with anger, but with something
  worse. *Understanding.*


  He picked up the flyer and tore it in half.

  The next morning, Mateo stood in the *tienda*, his uncle’s guayabera rolled up in
  his backpack. His dad was already behind the counter, counting the day’s receipts,
  his forehead creased with the kind of worry that had been there since Mateo could
  remember.


  *"Hoy es tu turno,"* his dad said without looking up. *"No falles."*


  Mateo swallowed. "I’m not falling. I’m just—" He hesitated. *"I’m staying here."*


  His dad finally looked at him, his dark eyes searching Mateo’s face like he was
  trying to find something he’d lost. *"¿Qué pasa, hijo?"*


  Mateo thought of his abuela’s question. *¿'
