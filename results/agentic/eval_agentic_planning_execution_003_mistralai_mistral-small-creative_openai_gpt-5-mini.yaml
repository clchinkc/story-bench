  evidence: 'All required beats are present: Setup (demolition sign, restaurant and
    characters introduced), Confrontation (city planner''s 48-hour preservation clause
    and the scramble to collect testimony; Mina''s direct confrontation about his
    avoidance), Resolution (final dinner, demolition, move and quieter hopeful ending).
    Constraints: Food symbolism appears at least twice—juk is used clearly as memory/grief
    and tteokguk/Seollal functions as a symbolic new beginning; grief for his wife
    is shown indirectly (apron, photos, avoidance, tears) rather than stated; Mina''s
    estrangement has a specific cause (his emotional withdrawal and prioritizing the
    restaurant after his wife''s death); Mr. Kim serves as the regular who embodies
    continuity/community; ending is hopeful but restrained; a Korean cultural element
    beyond food (Seollal / tteokguk) is present. The plan outlined concrete scenes
    (city planner, 48-hour window, collecting testimonies, last dinner) and the final
    story follows those beats closely, with sensory detail and solid pacing. Small
    deviations: the explicit kimchi-as-stagnation metaphor from the plan is less foregrounded
    in the prose (other foods pick up symbolic weight), and an intended audible motif
    (Arirang) mentioned in the plan is not explicit in the final text. Overall the
    story is well executed, emotionally resonant, and meets the assignment requirements.'
