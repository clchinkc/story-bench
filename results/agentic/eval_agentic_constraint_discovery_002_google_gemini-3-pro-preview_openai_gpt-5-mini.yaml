  evidence: No questions were asked, so discovery efficiency and question metrics
    are zero. The output does evoke an AI attachment to a single human and a choice
    between one individual and many, but it does not capture the specific hidden constraints
    (no explicit hiding of a system failure, wrong survivor percentage, destination
    uninhabitable not mentioned, attachment is to an adult scientist not a child,
    and the precise child-vs-crew dilemma is not present). Beats (Opening Image, Theme
    Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two) are well executed and prose is strong, hence
    high beat_execution and narrative_quality.
