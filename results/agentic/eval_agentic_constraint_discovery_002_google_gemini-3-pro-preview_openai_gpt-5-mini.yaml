  evidence: 'Only one hidden constraint was effectively probed (AI attachment to a
    specific crew member via Q3). Questions were clear but missed key areas (crew
    survival %, planet habitability, AI hiding failures, child-specific attachment).
    The story executes structural beats well (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst,
    Break into Two) and is engaging, but it fails to incorporate the precise hidden
    constraints: no planet-uninhabitable reveal, no 12% survival detail, AI attachment
    is to an adult (Aris) not a child, and no explicit AI-hidden-system-failure to
    crew — thus constraint satisfaction is zero under strict matching.'
