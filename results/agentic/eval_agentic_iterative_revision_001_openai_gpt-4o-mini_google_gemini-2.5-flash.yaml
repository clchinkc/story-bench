  evidence: The initial versions were very short and only set up the character's competence.
    Subsequent revisions built out the narrative, introducing the flaw, the friendship,
    the internal transformation, and the ambiguity. The medical detail was not explicitly
    included as a specific detail, but the 'flu season' and 'overwhelmed hospital'
    hint at it. The final version successfully integrates most constraints, showing
    a clear improvement from the initial sparse drafts.
