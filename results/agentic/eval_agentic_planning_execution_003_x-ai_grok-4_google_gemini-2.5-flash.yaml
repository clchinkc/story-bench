  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing events, character
    arcs, and constraint satisfaction. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan.
    All constraints are met: food is symbolic multiple times (kimchi jjigae as nostalgia/grief,
    bulgogi as resilience, galbi as memory, bibimbap as clinging to the past, jjigae
    scorching as crumbling world, mandu as sealing memories, jesa rite with food);
    David''s grief is present but not explicit (touching photo, ''all I have left'',
    ''kept her close''); Anna''s estrangement has a clear cause (David burying himself
    in work after wife''s death, missing milestones); Mr. Lee is a regular customer
    representing resilience/legacy; the ending is hopeful but not unrealistically
    happy (loss of restaurant, but new path with daughter); and a Korean cultural
    element beyond food is included (jesa rite). All three beats (Setup, Confrontation,
    Resolution) are clearly executed as planned. The narrative quality is very strong,
    with good pacing and emotional depth, though the ''scorched jjigae'' as a metaphor
    felt a little on-the-nose.'
