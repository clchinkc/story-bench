  evidence: 'The plan is very complete and specific, detailing events, character interactions,
    and constraint satisfaction for each beat. The final output adheres closely to
    the plan, with only minor deviations that enhance the story (e.g., the developer''s
    offer). All constraints are met: food symbolism (kimchi, bibimbap, soju, bulgogi,
    rice/eggs), implicit grief (apron, flinching at name, Jesa table, hospital bracelet,
    recipe book, choosing dead over living), specific estrangement cause (choosing
    restaurant/Jesa over daughter''s divorce/graduation), regular customer (Mrs. Chen
    representing loyalty/wisdom), hopeful but not unrealistic ending (moving on, teaching
    kitchen, not fully happy but forward-looking), and Korean cultural elements (kimchi,
    bibimbap, Jesa table, soju, mandu). The beats are clearly executed, and the narrative
    quality is strong, with good pacing and emotional depth.'
