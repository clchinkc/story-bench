  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan comprehensively addresses all required beats with clear
    page markers. Catalyst (FBI dismissal), Debate (internal conflict), Break into
    Two (symbol discovery), and Midpoint (Thompson confrontation) are all explicitly
    outlined. Output executes these beats effectively with strong atmospheric writing
    and character development. False lead (suspect tracking) is well-integrated. Unconventional
    profiling (rain patterns/street layouts) is creative and specific. Secondary betrayal
    (Sarah) is revealed with impact. Past failure confrontation is explicit and emotionally
    resonant. Ticking clock element is present throughout. WEAKNESSES: Plan mentions
    Midpoint confrontation will be ''non-physical'' but doesn''t fully detail Thompson''s
    role or the specific conflict points—output compensates by showing ideological
    clash. The unconventional profiling technique, while mentioned in plan, receives
    less development in output than the false lead (could be more prominent). Ticking
    clock element, though present, could be more urgent/specific with actual time
    constraints rather than metaphorical urgency. Sarah''s betrayal feels somewhat
    rushed in final paragraphs—could use more setup foreshadowing. EXECUTION QUALITY:
    Output maintains strong narrative voice, effective pacing through the beats, and
    good tension building. Character motivations are clear. The rain motif provides
    effective atmosphere. Dialogue feels natural. However, the transition to Sarah''s
    betrayal in final section feels slightly abrupt despite being planned. Overall,
    this is solid execution with minor pacing issues in the final act.'
