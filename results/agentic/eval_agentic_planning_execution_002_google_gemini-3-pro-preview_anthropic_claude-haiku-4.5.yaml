  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is exceptionally detailed with concrete scenes, dialogue,
    and emotional beats. Isolation is shown brilliantly through behavioral specifics
    (dismissing calls, waiting for drone to leave, gloved hands, noise-canceling headphones).
    The alien signal is genuinely alien—grinding metal, drowning machines, a mirror
    reflecting the listener''s intent rather than anthropomorphic communication. Thorne
    serves as an effective challenger to Yuki''s approach. Elias is unconventional
    as a mentor (janitor/sensory-deprivation specialist) and avoids typical wise-sage
    tropes. The threshold is psychological—Yuki must lower her mental walls and accept
    vulnerability. Maya''s moment of connection is surprising, precise, and earned
    through observation rather than exposition. All four beats execute cleanly: Call
    (General Vance''s intrusion), Refusal (Yuki''s panic and retreat), Mentor (Elias
    in cooling room), Threshold (Neural Bridge sequence). Output follows plan with
    minor enhancements. MINOR GAPS: Constraint 6 (genuine human connection that surprises
    Yuki) is satisfied by Maya but could be slightly more developed—the headphones
    moment is elegant but brief. The plan mentions Maya but the output execution,
    while effective, doesn''t fully explore Yuki''s surprise at this kindness. EXECUTION
    QUALITY: Pacing is excellent, sensory details are vivid, dialogue feels natural,
    and the emotional arc from isolation to connection is compelling. The final revelation
    (alien as lonely hive mind) provides thematic resonance with Yuki''s own isolation.
    Technical writing is strong with effective use of white space and perspective
    shifts.'
