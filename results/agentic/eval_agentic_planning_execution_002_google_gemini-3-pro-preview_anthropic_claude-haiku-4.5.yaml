  evidence: 'PLAN STRENGTHS: Exceptionally detailed outline with clear beat structure,
    specific behavioral markers for isolation (text-only communication, drop-box delivery),
    and concrete alien signal concept (gravitational chord/synesthesia). Mentor figure
    (Seven) is genuinely unconventional. Psychological threshold clearly articulated.
    PLAN WEAKNESSES: Refusal of the Call beat is mentioned but underdeveloped in outline
    structure. EXECUTION STRENGTHS: Opening is atmospheric and specific—isolation
    shown through expensive silence, holographic glyphs, voice disuse, spatial navigation
    patterns. Yuki''s behaviors are concrete (making herself small, avoiding eye contact,
    moving like a ghost). Thorne introduced effectively as challenger. Alien signal
    concept (gravitational chord) is present but underdeveloped in excerpt. EXECUTION
    GAPS: (1) CALL TO ADVENTURE beat is present but truncated—Vance''s contact feels
    rushed; (2) REFUSAL OF THE CALL is barely sketched (one line of dialogue); (3)
    MENTOR MEETING not yet reached in excerpt; (4) PSYCHOLOGICAL THRESHOLD not yet
    reached; (5) GENUINE HUMAN CONNECTION moment promised but not yet delivered; (6)
    Alien signal needs more sensory specificity beyond ''scream''—the synesthesia
    concept mentioned in plan is absent from execution. CONSTRAINT STATUS: ✓ Isolation
    shown behaviorally ✓ Colleague (Thorne) challenges approach ✓ Mentor unconventional
    (planned) ✓ Threshold psychological (planned) ✓ Human connection moment (planned
    but not executed) ✗ Alien signal feels slightly anthropomorphic (''scream'') rather
    than genuinely alien. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong opening with excellent atmospheric
    detail and character establishment. Pacing is deliberate. Tension builds through
    environmental contrast. However, execution is incomplete—only ~40% of planned
    story delivered. The excerpt cuts off mid-introduction of Thorne, preventing full
    evaluation of beat execution and constraint satisfaction in practice.'
