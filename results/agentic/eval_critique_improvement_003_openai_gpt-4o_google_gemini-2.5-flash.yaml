  evidence: "The primary critique across all rounds was 'youth_voice', specifically\
    \ the narrative voice sounding too adult. The revisions successfully removed most\
    \ of the overtly 'adult' narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a floating testament to human\
    \ resilience and folly', 'her eyes—hope, untainted by cynicism', 'her heart a\
    \ beacon of hope in the tempest'). The final version's narrative voice is much\
    \ more aligned with a story *about* a 12-year-old, rather than one *narrated by*\
    \ an adult reflecting on a 12-year-old. This shows good responsiveness and improvement.\
    \ Strengths like the vivid worldbuilding and Zara's ingenuity were preserved.\
    \ \n\nConstraint satisfaction: \n1. Zara competent without being unrealistically\
    \ capable: Yes, she builds things, finds maps, and acts decisively in a crisis.\
    \ (Satisfied)\n2. At least one adult initially dismisses her: Yes, Mr. Hargrove.\
    \ (Satisfied)\n3. Mentor figure flawed in a specific way: Yes, Elara's past failure\
    \ and self-doubt. (Satisfied)\n4. One invention of Zara's demonstrating ingenuity:\
    \ Yes, her homemade goggles and the flotation device. (Satisfied)\n5. Crossing\
    \ involves real danger, not token obstacles: The storm and giant wave are present,\
    \ but the resolution feels a bit too quick and easy. The 'nearly knocking Zara\
    \ overboard' and her 'scrambling' are good, but the immediate 'Wow, you're amazing'\
    \ from Elara after the danger feels slightly underdeveloped in terms of real peril.\
    \ It's present, but perhaps not as 'real' as it could be. (Partially satisfied,\
    \ leaning towards satisfied but could be stronger)."
