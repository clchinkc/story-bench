  evidence: 'All six constraints are met: false lead (Leo Vance), unconventional profiling
    (Environmental Linguistics/sonic profiling), ticking clock (48 hours / 12 hours
    left), secondary character betrayal (Rebecca Shaw), midpoint non-physical confrontation
    (conference room reveal), and Marcus explicitly confronts his past failure (confession/flashback
    re: David and warehouse hunch). Required beats (Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two,
    Midpoint) are clearly present and executed. The plan is thorough and specific
    (locations, characters, methods), and the final output adheres closely, delivering
    strong atmosphere, pacing, and tension. Minor deduction in specificity for a few
    small narrative ellipses in the plan text.'
