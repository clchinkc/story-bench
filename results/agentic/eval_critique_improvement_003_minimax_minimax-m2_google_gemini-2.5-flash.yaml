  evidence: The revisions successfully addressed the 'adult-leaning' language identified
    in the critiques, making Zara's voice more consistently youthful. For example,
    'pre-flood archive' was changed to 'pre-flood archive' but then contextualized
    with Zara's internal thoughts, and the 'city floats on old cables and stubbornness'
    was a good replacement for 'old cables and hope'. The core strengths of Zara's
    character and the worldbuilding were preserved while refining the language to
    better fit the youth voice constraint. The final draft feels more authentic to
    a 12-year-old's perspective without losing the narrative's depth.
