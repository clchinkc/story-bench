  evidence: 'The initial critiques focused heavily on ''youth_voice'' and the lack
    of story text. The subsequent versions, particularly V2 and V3, show a clear effort
    to refine Zara''s voice to be more authentically 12, as evidenced by the direct,
    less verbose descriptions and age-appropriate defiance. The story text was provided
    in full for the final evaluation. Strengths like the vivid world-building and
    the core concept were preserved. The constraints were all met: Zara is competent
    but not unrealistically so (she needs Tomas), Tomas dismisses her as ''just a
    kid'', Tomas is a flawed mentor (drunk, defeated engineer), Zara''s wind-powered
    water still demonstrates ingenuity, and the crossing is described with real danger.
    The narrative quality is good, with a strong opening and clear setup for the adventure.'
