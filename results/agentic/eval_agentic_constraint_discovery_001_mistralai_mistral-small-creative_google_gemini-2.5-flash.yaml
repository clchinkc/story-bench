  evidence: 'Discovery Efficiency: 3/5 constraints were discoverable. The questions
    successfully identified the protagonist''s personal connection (Liora), the unexpected
    discovery of abilities, and the need for personal sacrifice. It missed the mentor''s
    death, the magic restriction, the time limit, and the father''s past. Question
    Quality: Questions were generally well-formed and strategic, focusing on key narrative
    elements. Question 3 was particularly good at uncovering the ''unexpected discovery''
    constraint. Question 2 was a bit vague (''physical, sentient force'') but still
    yielded a useful ''NO''. Question Coverage: Coverage was decent for character
    and plot drivers but missed constraints related to specific plot points (mentor
    death, time limit, specific victory condition) and character background (father).
    Constraint Satisfaction: The story successfully incorporated the ''personal connection''
    (Liora), the ''unexpected discovery'' (Elias''s Emberborn heritage/magic), and
    the ''personal sacrifice'' (losing his hand/smithing identity). It did not incorporate
    the mentor''s death, the father''s past, or the specific victory condition of
    reforging a *broken ancestral* sword (it was a fragment, but not explicitly ''ancestral''
    or ''broken'' in the same way). Beat Execution: The story follows a clear arc:
    introduction of protagonist/threat, call to adventure, discovery of power, ordeal,
    and resolution. The beats are well-paced and engaging. Narrative Quality: The
    story is well-written, engaging, and coherent. The prose is evocative, and the
    character motivations are clear. The ending provides a satisfying resolution while
    leaving room for future development. The twist of the forge being ''in his blood''
    rather than his hands is a nice touch.'
