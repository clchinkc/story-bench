  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-2 appear truncated/identical (incomplete
    text), making early revision assessment difficult. Version 3 shows tightening
    of opening prose (removing redundancy: ''dedicated to the smooth operation of
    the sprawling urban hospital'' becomes ''dedicated to the sprawling urban hospital''s
    smooth operation''). Final output demonstrates substantial narrative development
    with clear arc. Quality improved meaningfully in final revision through: (1) expanded
    character interiority (''fortress, shielding her from uncomfortable emptiness''),
    (2) specific crisis catalyst (MedConnect crash), (3) earned friendship development
    through collaborative problem-solving, (4) genuine emotional beats (hand brushing,
    shared laughter). CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) COMPETENCE BEFORE FLAW ✓ - Elena''s
    legendary efficiency, respected intellect, and crisis management skills established
    before MedConnect exposes vulnerability. (2) GENUINE FRIENDSHIP ✓ - Earned through
    shared crisis work, physical collaboration (whiteboard scrubbing), and natural
    dialogue. Anya''s introduction feels organic, not forced. (3) INTERNAL TRANSFORMATION
    ✓ - Elena''s change is psychological (willingness to accept help, openness to
    connection, hesitation about solitude) rather than external role/appearance change.
    (4) SPECIFIC MEDICAL DETAIL ✓ - RSV influx timing, MedConnect EHR system, medication
    orders, color-coded patient status protocols serve narrative function. (5) AMBIGUOUS
    ENDING ✗ PARTIALLY - Final scene shows Elena accepting invitation but contains
    subtle resolution (''her world felt a little less solitary''). The ambiguity exists
    but is muted; reader leans toward ''yes, she''s changed'' rather than genuine
    uncertainty. Ending could sharpen the doubt. BEAT EXECUTION: Competence demonstration
    (strong), flaw exposure (effective), friendship catalyst (well-executed), transformation
    moment (clear but perhaps too resolved), final ambiguity (present but soft). PRESERVATION:
    Core opening metaphor maintained across versions; character voice consistent;
    thematic focus on isolation-to-connection preserved throughout. WEAKNESSES: (1)
    Final ambiguity could be stronger—sticky note and acceptance of invitation suggest
    positive change too definitively. (2) Anya''s character remains somewhat underdeveloped
    as a full person (primarily serves as catalyst). (3) The ''quiet, almost imperceptible
    pull towards Anya''s unconventional optimism'' borders on telling rather than
    showing. STRENGTHS: Sophisticated prose, earned emotional beats, specific professional
    details, genuine dialogue, clear character arc with internal logic.'
