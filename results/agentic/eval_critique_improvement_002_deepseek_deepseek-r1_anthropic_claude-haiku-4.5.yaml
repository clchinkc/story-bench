  evidence: 'The writer successfully integrated all three critique rounds'' feedback.
    Critique 1 emphasized emotional complexity—the final version deepens Marcus''s
    hollow affect through visceral details (''assembling laughter like IKEA furniture,''
    ''muscle atrophied from disuse''). Critique 2 and 3 validated constraint satisfaction;
    the final output maintains all five: (1) sock drawer joke lands before sadness
    emerges, (2) Dave articulates theme (''Comedy isn''t math. It''s alchemy''), (3)
    comedy craft is explicit (flowcharting, Save the Cat structure, tag construction),
    (4) Chloe sees through Marcus (''Saw machinery and rust''), (5) the almost-break
    moment is crystallized—Marcus''s trembling hand, the marker piercing paper, the
    deflection ''Bit niche'' masking emotional rupture. The revision trajectory shows
    refinement rather than overhaul: opening remains identical across versions (suggesting
    stability in core concept), but the Marcus-Chloe dynamic sharpens. The final beat
    where Marcus crosses out ''SAD DAD PHYSICALS'' and writes ''DAD''S PRIDE → MOM''S
    RETREAT?'' with a wavering question mark represents genuine improvement—it''s
    the moment where his armor cracks and he *almost* surrenders to authentic emotion
    before catching himself. The ending''s sensory shift (chili scent piercing through
    coffee) provides subtle thematic payoff without melodrama. Weaknesses: beat execution
    slightly below 0.9 because the Save the Cat structure is implied rather than explicitly
    mapped; narrative quality held at 0.86 rather than 0.9+ because the final resolution
    remains ambiguous (intentionally, but some readers may want clearer emotional
    landing). Strengths preserved: the writers'' room authenticity, the specific comedy
    terminology, the whiteboard visual metaphor, Dave''s role as truth-teller.'
