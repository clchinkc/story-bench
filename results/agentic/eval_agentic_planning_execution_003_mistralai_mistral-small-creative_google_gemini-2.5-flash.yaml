  evidence: 'The plan is comprehensive, addressing all constraints and beats with
    specific details. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan. All constraints
    are met: food symbolism (juk, kimchi), unspoken grief (apron, Arirang, trembling
    hands, avoiding apartment), specific cause for estrangement (neglect for restaurant
    after wife''s death), regular customer (Mr. Kim representing tradition/community),
    hopeful but not unrealistic ending (moving on, new beginning, not saving the restaurant),
    and Korean cultural elements (juk, kimchi jjigae, bossam, barley tea, tteokbokki,
    bibimbap, tteokguk, Seollal, Arirang). The beats are clearly executed. The narrative
    quality is strong, with good pacing and emotional depth, though some transitions
    could be smoother.'
