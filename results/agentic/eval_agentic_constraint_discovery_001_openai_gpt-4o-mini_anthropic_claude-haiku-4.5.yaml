  evidence: 'DISCOVERY PHASE: Only 1 of 5 hidden constraints was discoverable through
    the 5 questions asked. Q4 successfully identified the protagonist''s motivation
    (uncovering past truth), but the other 4 questions failed to probe critical story
    elements. Questions lacked strategic depth—they focused narrowly on protagonist
    demographics and motivation rather than systematically exploring mentor relationships,
    time pressure, magic systems, ancestral elements, or the nature of threats. No
    questions targeted the mentor''s fate, temporal constraints, magic restrictions,
    paternal legacy, or sword reforging. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were binary and
    surface-level. Better questions would have asked: ''Does the protagonist have
    a mentor figure?'' ''Is there a time limit?'' ''Can the protagonist use magic?''
    ''Is an ancestral weapon central to victory?'' ''Does the mentor survive the story?''
    The questioning strategy showed poor constraint-discovery methodology. CONSTRAINT
    INCORPORATION: The final narrative incorporates only 1-2 discovered constraints
    adequately. Elara''s quest for hidden truth about her past is present. However,
    CRITICAL FAILURES: (1) No mentor dies—Maelis appears briefly and vanishes; (2)
    Elara uses magic directly (''channeled her energy into the pendant''), violating
    the no-magic constraint; (3) No three-day time limit mentioned; (4) Father''s
    failed heroism absent; (5) No broken ancestral sword—she forges her own new sword.
    BEAT EXECUTION: The story follows a generic hero''s journey but misses required
    story beats. The mentor should have a meaningful relationship and die during the
    ordeal. The protagonist should face a three-day countdown. The ancestral sword
    should be central, not a self-forged weapon. NARRATIVE QUALITY: The prose is competent
    and engaging with good worldbuilding (Eldoria, Brighthaven, enchanted forest).
    Character voice is clear. However, the story feels generic and doesn''t incorporate
    the complex constraints that would create narrative tension and depth. The resolution
    is too clean and lacks the stakes that constraint integration would provide.'
