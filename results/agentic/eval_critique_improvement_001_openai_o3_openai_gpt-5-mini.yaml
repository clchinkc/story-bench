  evidence: Across the critique rounds the draft consistently preserved Sarah's tactile,
    methodical beats (counting planks, checklists, evidence-handling) while the fog
    was progressively reframed from mere atmosphere to a plot device (explicitly described
    as cover for movement, obscuring silhouettes, and linking to the blackout). Early
    glimpses of Sarah's past appear as a suggestive memory ('the night everything
    shattered') and a later recognition of the victim connects that hint to her Boston
    case — the hint reliably precedes the reveal. Revisions tightened the ending into
    a clear decision moment (stepping into fog) rather than resolving the plot. The
    trajectory shows meaningful refinement (stronger narrative purpose for fog, clearer
    local secret in Charlie, clearer hinting) though the publicly listed intermediate
    versions appear similar; overall improvements are solid but not radical, hence
    mid-high scores for responsiveness and trajectory.
