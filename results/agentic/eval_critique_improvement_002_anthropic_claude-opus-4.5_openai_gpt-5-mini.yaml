  evidence: Across the three critique rounds the piece maintained its core strengths
    (early humor, clear craft details, emotional pivot when Priya arrives). The professional
    critiques praised the emotional complexity and cited specific lines that landed;
    the final version preserves and slightly sharpens those moments rather than overhauling
    them. Revision history shows minimal visible textual change between versions,
    so measurable improvement is limited — refinements are subtle (tightening of emotional
    beats, clearer theme statement via Jenny, Priya’s perceptive lines). Overall the
    revisions respond to critiques about deepening pathos and demonstrating craft,
    but the trajectory is modest rather than transformative.
