  evidence: The critiques consistently highlighted the strong execution of Sarah's
    methodical nature and the narrative purpose of the fog. The revisions maintained
    and even enhanced these elements. The main area of improvement, as seen in the
    trajectory, was the integration of the local character's secret and the hint/reveal
    of Sarah's past case. Early versions hinted at the past case but didn't fully
    integrate it with the local character's secret or the ending decision. The final
    version masterfully weaves these elements together. Eli Moran's evasiveness and
    the paint residue become a subtle hint at his secret, which is then amplified
    by the discovery of the body and the tattoo, directly linking to Sarah's past
    case. The ending decision is strong and directly tied to the revealed past, showing
    excellent responsiveness to the constraint and overall narrative improvement.
