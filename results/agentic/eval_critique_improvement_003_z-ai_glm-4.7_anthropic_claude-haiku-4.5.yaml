  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Revisions show deliberate effort to address
    youth_voice concerns. V0→V1 adds ''wincing'' (physical authenticity). V1→V3 removes
    philosophically abstract lines (''Dead things didn''t leak steam...'') and replaces
    with action-driven narration (''Come on,'' she muttered). However, some abstract
    phrasing persists (''treating the city like a corpse,'' ''If it sparked, you could
    fix it'') that still reads slightly mature for 12-year-old internal voice. Score
    reflects partial but incomplete responsiveness to critique pattern.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0→V3 shows measurable gains: (1) Dialogue becomes more
    natural (''Come on'' vs. philosophical asides); (2) Technical language is contextualized
    through action rather than exposition; (3) Physical sensations ground scenes (wincing,
    stomach twisting). However, gains plateau after V2—V3 adds worldbuilding but doesn''t
    further refine voice. Trajectory is positive but decelerating.


    PRESERVATION: Strengths maintained across versions: Sun-Spear invention remains
    vivid and functional; Mrs. Gable dismissal (''waste of effort'') preserved and
    strengthened; Kael''s flawed mentor role (tremor, ethanol, dismissiveness) intact;
    real danger (surge, currents, drowning) preserved. No meaningful losses.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4/5):

    ✓ Competence without unrealism: Zara invents, navigates tech, but needs Kael''s
    expertise and acknowledges her limits (''I can''t navigate the debris field'')

    ✓ Adult dismissal: Mrs. Gable (''waste of effort'') + Kael (''You''re twelve'')

    ✓ Flawed mentor: Kael has tremor, drinks, doubts himself—specific flaw of trauma-induced
    hesitation

    ✓ Zara''s invention: Sun-Spear (telescope + satellite dish) demonstrates ingenuity

    ✗ Real danger crossing: Setup is strong (surge, currents, pylons), but crossing
    itself is NOT SHOWN. Story ends at threshold (''stepped out into the wind'').
    Danger is promised, not executed. This is the critical gap.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Call to adventure (radar signal) ✓; Refusal (Kael''s dismissal)
    ✓; Meeting mentor (already established) ✓; Crossing threshold (incomplete—ends
    at departure) ✗; Tests/allies (Kael becomes ally) ✓. Missing the actual crossing
    sequence prevents full Hero''s Journey execution.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Worldbuilding is vivid (New Boston 2089, driftwood platforms,
    drowned Financial District). Dialogue feels natural. Pacing accelerates effectively.
    Zara''s voice is mostly authentic with occasional lapses. Primary weakness: narrative
    stops before the promised crossing, leaving the story incomplete and the central
    danger unresolved. This undermines narrative satisfaction despite strong setup.'
  critical_gaps:
  - Real danger crossing is set up but not executed—story ends at threshold
  - Some abstract phrasing persists in internal monologue despite revision efforts
  - Hero's Journey incomplete without crossing sequence
  strengths:
  - Invention (Sun-Spear) is concrete and functional
  - Mentor flaws are specific and character-driven
  - Worldbuilding is immersive and consistent
  - Dialogue authenticity improved significantly across revisions
  - Dismissal of Zara by adults is earned and natural
error: null
