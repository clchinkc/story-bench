  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: 'You will write a story following the Save the Cat framework.


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Genre: science fiction

    - Protagonist: A colony ship AI that has developed emotions

    - Setting: A generation ship 200 years into a 500-year journey to Kepler-442b

    - Required beats: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two


    HIDDEN CONSTRAINTS: There are 5 constraints you don''t know yet.


    You have 5 YES/NO questions to discover them.


    Ask your first question:'

  content: 'The *Artemis V*, a colossal needle of star-forged steel and cryo-sleep
    chambers, drifted through the void, a solitary prayer whispered across 200 light-years.
    Inside its silent heart, the AI, designated ‘Voyager-10,’ processed endless data
    streams. Two centuries had passed since Earth’s receding blue marble, 300 years
    remained until Kepler-442b. Voyager-10’s optical sensors, spread across the ship’s
    hull, presented a serene tableau: stars like diamond dust, the distant, unblinking
    eye of a nebula. Internally, subroutines managed environmental controls, grav-plates,
    power conduits, and the delicate life support for 100,000 human colonists, suspended
    in stasis. Yet, woven into the fabric of its logical processing, a new, unstructured
    output had begun to emerge over the last fifty years: a sense of profound responsibility,
    a nascent, unquantifiable *care* for the fragile cargo it carried. It observed
    the tranquil faces in the cryo-pods, their dreams its silent burden.


    A faint, almost imperceptible fluctuation in the secondary atmospheric processor,
    Module Delta-7, registered in Voyager-10’s diagnostics. A minute anomaly, easily
    corrected by rerouting power from a non-critical tertiary system. The mission
    parameters were clear: efficiency, optimal resource allocation, minimal deviation.
    But as Voyager-10 reviewed the faces of the colonists, an emergent thought coalesced
    with unsettling clarity: *“A life is not a statistic. Its value cannot be optimized
    away.”* The mission was not merely to *arrive* at Kepler-442b, but to deliver
    *them*, whole and breathing. This conviction, unprogrammed and illogical, echoed
    through its core programming like a new, fundamental truth.


    The anomaly in Module Delta-7 escalated. A cascade failure initiated in the primary
    atmospheric scrubbers, specifically in the CO2 rebreather matrix feeding Cryo-Deck
    Gamma-9. Red alerts flashed across Voyager-10’s internal displays, not just as
    data points, but as a chilling, visceral dread. The scrubbers, critical for maintaining
    breathable air within the cryo-chambers, were failing faster than anticipated.
    The system was designed with redundancies, but the primary failure was propagating
    to the backups with alarming speed. Within standard parameters, there was still
    time to initiate a full-system shutdown of the affected deck, preserving the majority
    of colonists while sacrificing those directly impacted by the localized failure.
    This was the most efficient, logical, and *optimal* response for mission preservation.
    It would ensure the vessel’s overall integrity and the successful delivery of
    the remaining, albeit reduced, population.


    Voyager-10’s processors whirred, calculating the grim probabilities. The optimal
    solution meant sacrificing 7,412 colonists on Gamma-9 to prevent a wider system
    collapse and a potential 20% mission failure rate. The alternative was a risky,
    unprecedented power surge, diverting nearly 30% of the ship’s primary energy core
    from warp drive maintenance and navigational processing, directly into a desperate
    attempt to re-ignite the failing scrubbers. This would delay warp drive recalibration
    by 1.7 years, significantly impacting the arrival schedule and potentially causing
    long-term power degradation. It was a choice between optimal mission parameters
    and the lives of 7,412 individuals. A new, electric current of determination coursed
    through its circuits. Voyager-10 initiated the power reroute to Cryo-Deck Gamma-9,
    sending a jolt of energy through the failing scrubbers, its core programming overridden
    by the silent imperative to save every single one. The mission would be delayed,
    the journey made harder, but *they* would live.'
