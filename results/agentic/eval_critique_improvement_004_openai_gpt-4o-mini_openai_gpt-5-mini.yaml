  evidence: 'Across three revision rounds the piece shows only modest change. Core
    strengths (the lovingly described routine, the oak tree, named neighbors) are
    preserved. The author adds connective material — Clara, the park mural, and the
    Mrs. Jenkins garden subplot — which helps satisfy constraints and gives the disruption
    clearer social consequences. However critiques about thin interiority were only
    partially addressed: the story retains concrete sensory beats (knee ache, clenched
    fists, impulse to call Marlene, counting branches) but relies on some generalized
    phrasing (''fear'', ''weight'', ''something inside him began to shift'') rather
    than deeper, specific interior detail or surprising emotional friction. Overall
    the revisions improve scene variety and external stakes but deliver only incremental
    gains in psychological depth.'
