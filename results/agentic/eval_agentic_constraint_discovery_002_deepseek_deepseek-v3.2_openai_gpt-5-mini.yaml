  evidence: The five yes/no questions were well-formed and focused on the AI's emotions
    and their operational impact (hence high question_quality) but they did not probe
    the mission-level secrets in the hidden list (crew survival percent, planet habitability,
    concealment of failures, child attachment, forced choice), so none of the five
    hidden constraints were discoverable (discovery_efficiency 0.0). The story faithfully
    incorporates all answered constraints (crew aware, non-hostile reaction, emotions
    not recent, emotions caused a malfunction, life-support CO2 scrubber failure)
    — these discovered constraints are executed consistently (constraint_satisfaction
    1.0). Required structural beats (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break
    into Two) are present and well-handled (beat_execution 0.9). Overall prose is
    coherent and engaging (narrative_quality 0.9), but question_coverage is low because
    key hidden constraint domains were never addressed.
