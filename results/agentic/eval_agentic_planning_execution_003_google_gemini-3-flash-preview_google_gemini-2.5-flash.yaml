  evidence: 'The plan addresses all constraints and beats comprehensively. It is highly
    specific, detailing symbolic food choices, the cause of estrangement, and the
    regular customer''s role. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan. All
    six constraints are satisfied: food is symbolic twice (Mandu, Japchae), David''s
    grief is present but not explicit (Min-ah''s chair, the dip in the linoleum, the
    shrine comment), the estrangement cause is specific and believable (David protecting
    Chloe from the funeral), Mr. Henderson is a regular representing the neighborhood''s
    disappearing soul, the ending is hopeful but not unrealistically happy (moving
    on, not fighting the highway), and Jesa is included as a Korean cultural element.
    All three beats (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution) are properly executed. The
    narrative quality is excellent, with strong pacing, emotional depth, and effective
    use of symbolism.'
