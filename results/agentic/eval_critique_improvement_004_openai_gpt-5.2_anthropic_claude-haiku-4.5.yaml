  evidence: 'The revisions demonstrate strong responsiveness to critique feedback.
    Critique 1-3 consistently praised character interiority (0.80-0.88 range), and
    the final output preserves and deepens this strength through expanded internal
    monologue (''His stomach tightened with something that wasn''t fear exactly. More
    like reluctance to be surprised'') and the ghost-voice of Lena (''Don''t be stubborn,
    Teddy. People won''t bite unless you ask ''em to''). The trajectory shows improvement
    in constraint satisfaction: (1) Teddy''s routine is rendered with exquisite specificity—6:10
    kettle, 6:12 paper folding, 6:18 windbreaker, 6:23 departure, 6:27 Mrs. Kline''s
    curtains, bench at Alter corner. (2) The disruption (sidewalk closure) reveals
    Teddy''s avoidance of connection and spontaneity—his rigid routine was a defense
    mechanism. (3) Neighbor integration is sophisticated: both Mara (young mother,
    blue house) and Devon (renovator) have intersecting stories that mirror Teddy''s
    own grief and stagnation. (4) Lena''s absence permeates through the empty coat
    hook, the thermos that ''stayed'' after her death, and her internalized voice.
    (5) The new path (alley route, coffee with Devon, human connection) offers what
    the old path couldn''t: genuine relationship and the possibility of moving forward.
    Beat execution is strong: inciting incident (orange sign), rising action (meeting
    Mara, discovering alley), midpoint (Devon''s garage), climax (accepting coffee
    invitation), and the truncated resolution suggests transformation beginning. Subtlety
    is maintained throughout—emotions conveyed through gesture (patting empty pocket),
    sensory detail (sidewalk sounds, sawdust pollen), and action rather than exposition.
    Prose quality is consistently high with memorable images (''concrete had learned
    to listen,'' ''air had teeth,'' ''tiny ones that look like nothing and turn out
    to be everything''). Minor weakness: the ending cuts off mid-sentence, which appears
    unintentional and prevents full evaluation of resolution quality, though the trajectory
    strongly suggests successful completion.'
