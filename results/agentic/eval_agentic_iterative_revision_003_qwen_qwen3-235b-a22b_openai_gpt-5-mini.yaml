  evidence: Across versions the piece moved from exposition-heavy and somewhat tell-y
    to vivid scenes that show Mateo's conflict. Version 0 sets the situation but relies
    on exposition; Version 1 tightens voice and introduces stakes; the final revision
    adds a specific crystallizing moment at the clinic (abuela gripping his forearm,
    saying 'Vete', shoving the tamale), a clearly understanding adult (Mrs. Ruiz's
    'Desert blooms...' remark), and sustained cultural details (masa, queso fresco,
    prickly pear jam, Spanish phrases). Key motifs (diner, Javier, abuela's meds,
    the necklace) were preserved and deepened. The ending is earned by Mateo's decision
    and the follow-through (the photo, unopened meds, abuela steadied by a nurse),
    demonstrating growth rather than a sudden change.
