  evidence: 'None of the five hidden constraints were elicited by the questions. The
    questions focused on gender, general motivations, and the cause of darkness, missing
    the specific hidden beats (mentor death; protagonist cannot use magic; three-day
    deadline; fallen-hero father; reforging ancestral sword). The final story violates
    or omits all five hidden constraints: the mentor (Maelis) survives rather than
    dying in the Ordeal; Elara directly channels/uses magical power via the pendant
    (contradicting ''cannot use magic directly''); there is no three-day time limit
    or ticking clock; the father-as-failed-hero backstory is absent; and victory is
    achieved by merging a pendant with a crystal rather than reforging a broken ancestral
    sword. One non-hidden trait (protagonist seeking her past) was discovered and
    used, but it is not among the hidden constraints. Overall the questions were not
    strategic for uncovering the hidden constraints, and the story, while coherent
    and readable, fails to implement any required hidden beats.'
