  evidence: 'All six constraints are present: false lead (Donovan Price), unconventional
    profiling (digital footprint + weather/data mosaic), ticking clock (killer announced
    next murder time), secondary character betrayal (Price), Midpoint direct confrontation
    (verbal duel with informant), and Marcus explicitly confronting past failure (''I
    failed once'' and memories of partner). Required beats are executed: Catalyst
    (new murder/symbol/announced next time), Debate (whether to involve FBI vs solo),
    Break into Two (Marcus resolves to change approach and uses his own technique),
    Midpoint (non-physical but direct confrontation in interrogation). Plan is detailed
    with concrete scenes, named characters, and specific techniques; the final output
    adheres closely, with strong atmosphere and pacing though some scenes are summarized
    rather than fully dramatized, hence a slightly reduced specificity and narrative
    score.'
