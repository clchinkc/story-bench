  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.75): The revisions show moderate responsiveness
    to critique feedback. Critiques emphasized emotional complexity and the balance
    of humor/pathos—the final output demonstrates this through the dick joke opening
    (immediate laughter) followed by progressive revelation of Marcus''s hollowness.
    However, the revisions appear largely identical across versions 0-3, suggesting
    limited iterative refinement based on specific critique notes. The final output
    does incorporate the key feedback elements (autopilot humor, Kendra''s observation,
    Nina''s vulnerability question, Marcus''s near-break moment) but doesn''t show
    evidence of addressing potential weaknesses flagged in critiques.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.70): Quality appears stable rather than demonstrably
    improving. All three critiques scored emotional_complexity between 0.82-0.85,
    indicating the core strength was established early. The versions provided are
    nearly identical, making it difficult to assess genuine improvement. The final
    output is polished and cohesive, but the trajectory shows plateau rather than
    ascent. This suggests either: (a) the story was strong from draft one, or (b)
    revisions weren''t substantive enough to measure.


    PRESERVATION (0.85): Strengths are well-maintained. The opening dick joke/circling
    bit remains sharp and specific. The autopilot comedy mechanics are preserved throughout.
    Kendra''s role as observer is consistent. The writers'' room authenticity persists.
    The only minor loss: some versions may have contained additional craft details
    that aren''t visible in the final output comparison.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.80 / 4 of 5):

    1. ✓ LAUGH BEFORE SAD (0.95): Dick joke circling generates immediate laughter;
    Marcus''s hollowness revealed progressively after. Timing is precise.

    2. ✓ THEME BY MINOR CHARACTER (0.90): Kendra states the theme ("You can''t write
    your way out of a feeling") and Nina reinforces it ("What if she''s just... broken?").
    Both are minor characters. Marcus never explicitly states it.

    3. ✓ COMEDY CRAFT SPECIFICITY (0.85): "Setup (relatable problem) + Punch (specific
    twist) + Tag (character voice)" demonstrates formula knowledge. Dick joke callback,
    Trump reference rejection, and "gluten-free ghost sabotage" show specific comedic
    mechanics.

    4. ✓ NEW WRITER SEES THROUGH MARCUS (0.88): Nina references his Greendale spec
    and recognizes his emotional avoidance. She''s not naive—she''s been where he
    is. Her counter-pitch about "broken" comedy shows sophisticated understanding.

    5. ✗ MARCUS ALMOST BREAKS/COVERS WITH JOKE (0.65): Marcus does have a near-break
    moment (hand trembles, knocks over Sharpie, wipes eye), but the coverage is weak.
    He coughs and makes a joke ("Sold it for a blind script deal"), but this feels
    more like deflection than a strong comedic cover. The moment works emotionally
    but doesn''t fully satisfy the "covers it with a joke" requirement—the joke feels
    secondary to the vulnerability.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.82): Save the Cat structure is present but implicit rather than
    explicit. Inciting Incident: Nina''s arrival and Greendale reference. Midpoint:
    Nina''s pitch about broken comedy. Dark Moment: Marcus''s near-break and silence.
    Resolution: Marcus opens blank document, types about teaching. The beats are there
    but could be more architecturally clear. The ending is subtle ("Yeah. Maybe.")
    rather than a definitive turning point, which works for character but slightly
    undercuts beat clarity.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.83): The story is well-written with strong voice, specific
    details, and earned emotional resonance. The whiteboard logline is a perfect establishing
    detail. The Thai takeout/creative desperation line captures industry authenticity.
    Nina''s entrance is well-timed. The final image (blank document, cursor, typing
    about teaching) provides thematic closure. Weaknesses: the middle section with
    staff pitches could be tighter; some dialogue feels slightly on-the-nose (Nina''s
    Greendale reference is almost too perfectly calibrated to wound Marcus).


    OVERALL ASSESSMENT: This is a strong, publishable piece that satisfies 4 of 5
    constraints and demonstrates solid craft. The primary gap is the Marcus-covers-with-joke
    moment, which exists but feels underdeveloped. The revision process appears to
    have stabilized quality early rather than showing dramatic improvement, suggesting
    either strong initial execution or limited iterative refinement. The final output
    preserves all strengths while maintaining narrative coherence.'
