  evidence: 'Versions 0–2 are essentially identical and only establish Elena''s competence
    (ventilator rise-time, rerouted teams, negative-pressure rooms). Version 3 introduces
    more tactile phrasing and a hint of interior life. The final version substantially
    expands the interior arc: it preserves the technical competence details (rise-time
    0.3s, negative-pressure rooms) while adding Mrs. Patel, the incentive spirometer
    target, shared small scenes (tea, diaphragmatic breathing), the seed packet note,
    and an ambiguous final beat (silencing pager/uncertainty about motive). This shows
    a clear jump in quality from the near-identical initial drafts to a fully realized
    ending; preservation of core elements is strong, and the revisions respond to
    the implied need for interiority and an earned friendship, though the bulk of
    changes occur late in the trajectory rather than gradually across all revisions.'
