  evidence: The plan is mostly complete and specific, outlining how each constraint
    and beat will be addressed. However, the execution falls short. The story ends
    abruptly after the 'Refusal of the Call' and the introduction of the challenger,
    Dr. Aris Thorne. The 'Meeting the Mentor' and 'Crossing the Threshold' beats are
    not reached. Consequently, several constraints tied to these later beats (unconventional
    mentor, psychological threshold, human connection, alien signal details) are not
    satisfied. The isolation constraint is well-executed early on, and the challenger
    is introduced as planned. The alien signal is mentioned but not fully explored
    as per the plan's detail (gravitational chord, synesthesia). The narrative quality
    is good for the portion provided, but it's incomplete.
