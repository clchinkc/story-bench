  evidence: 'The plan is comprehensive and detailed, covering all constraints and
    beats with specific actions and character descriptions. The final output adheres
    perfectly to the plan. All constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through
    her actions (drone, retinal display, avoiding eye contact); the alien signal is
    genuinely alien (shifting tectonic plates, whale song, drowning machines, metal
    taste); Thorne challenges Yuki''s approach; Elias is an unconventional mentor;
    the threshold is psychological (burning down the apartment); and Maya''s act of
    empathy is a genuine human connection. All four beats (Call to Adventure, Refusal,
    Mentor, Threshold) are clearly executed. The narrative quality is strong, with
    good pacing and tension, though the ending feels a little rushed in its resolution.'
