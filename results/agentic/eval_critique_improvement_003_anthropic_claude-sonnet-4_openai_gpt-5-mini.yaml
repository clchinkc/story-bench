  evidence: Across the three revision rounds the text remains effectively the same;
    the core strengths called out in critiques (age-appropriate lines like "Holy kelp,"
    physical reactions, vivid workshop details) were preserved, but the flagged weaknesses—chiefly
    the occasional sophisticated phrasing that undercuts a wholly authentic 12-year-old
    voice—were not meaningfully addressed. The story satisfies all five explicit constraints
    (competent but plausible protagonist; adults initially dismissive; a mentor with
    a concrete flaw—Marcus's hearing loss and trauma; a clear inventive gadget—Zara's
    water purifier; and a crossing framed as genuinely dangerous with storm, radiation,
    unstable structures, and debris). Hero's Journey beats are present and serviceable
    (ordinary world, call to adventure, refusal, meeting the mentor, threshold crossing
    beginning), though some beats are compacted rather than fully developed. Worldbuilding
    is vivid and consistent with the post-climate setting, and hope is balanced with
    real stakes without tipping into saccharine. Overall, little iterative improvement
    is evident despite repeated critiques; strengths were retained but critiques were
    not substantially incorporated.
