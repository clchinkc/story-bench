  evidence: The revisions consistently improved the prose, particularly in establishing
    Sarah's methodical nature through action and enhancing the narrative role of the
    fog. The initial versions were a bit generic in their descriptions, but by version
    3 and the final output, the language became much more precise and evocative. For
    example, the evolution of 'The fog rolled in like a thief' to 'The fog didn’t
    move like wind—it *unfolded*, peeling back from the dock in slow, deliberate sheets
    as if revealing a stage' shows a clear improvement in descriptive power and narrative
    purpose. Sarah's methodical nature is shown through actions like 'testing each
    move' and 'pulled on latex gloves, the cold making her fingers stiff. Then she
    reached for his hand, turning it slowly, methodically.' The fog serves a narrative
    purpose by obscuring, creating atmosphere, and even being 'tired of' by Mercer,
    hinting at its role in hiding secrets. The local character (Mercer) clearly has
    a secret, hinted at by his deliberate actions and later revealed through the brother's
    photo. Sarah's past case is hinted at early ('The case in Boston—the one where
    the evidence had whispered lies') and then directly linked to the current case
    with the tattoo. The ending is a clear moment of decision, not resolution, with
    Sarah having to choose between running or staying, and then extinguishing her
    flashlight, leaving the outcome ambiguous. Strengths like the atmospheric writing
    and the mystery were preserved and enhanced throughout the revisions.
