  evidence: 'Discovery Efficiency: Only one constraint was discoverable: ''The protagonist
    cannot use magic directly'' (implied by ''Is there a magical element or artifact
    that plays a crucial role in the story?'' and the story stating Eamon uses a sword
    and the Emberstone''s light, not his own magic). The mentor dying, time limit,
    father''s past, and reforging the sword were not discoverable. Question Quality:
    Questions were generally well-formed but lacked strategic depth to uncover the
    specific hidden constraints. They were too generic. Question Coverage: Questions
    covered magic, character relationships (mentor, friendship, romance, non-human),
    but missed key plot points like time limits, specific character backstories (father),
    or specific victory conditions (sword reforging). Constraint Satisfaction: Only
    the ''protagonist cannot use magic directly'' constraint was somewhat satisfied
    by the narrative focusing on the Emberstone''s magic and Eamon''s sword. The mentor
    does not die, there''s no mention of a time limit, no father''s past, and no reforging
    of a sword. Beat Execution: The story clearly follows the hero''s journey beats
    (Call to Adventure, Crossing the Threshold, Ordeal). Narrative Quality: The story
    is coherent and engaging, but somewhat generic. The ending feels a bit abrupt
    and lacks the depth that the hidden constraints could have provided.'
