  evidence: 'Versions 0–3 are essentially identical (no visible revision), so there
    was stagnation across the numbered revisions. The final output, however, introduces
    substantial new material: the medical event (vision blur, nystagmus, IV for dehydration),
    Maria the nurse and the emergent friendship, Elena’s personal backstory (piano,
    mother with dementia), and an ambiguous ending. That represents a clear improvement
    from the unchanged earlier drafts, but the improvement trajectory is uneven (long
    plateau then a strong final revision). Good elements from the opening (Elena’s
    competence and control) were preserved and integrated into the longer piece, while
    new beats were added to satisfy the constraints.'
