  evidence: 'Two of five hidden constraints were uncovered by the questions: (1) protagonist
    must rely on craft rather than magic, and (2) the Ordeal centers on reforging
    a broken legendary artifact. The questions were strategic and varied (method of
    resolution, nature of darkness, betrayal, artifact, antagonist relation) though
    they missed time limit, mentor death, and father-backstory axes. The final story
    fully incorporates the discovered constraints (craft-driven resolution and reforging
    the Crest) so constraint_satisfaction is high. Required narrative beats (Call,
    Crossing, Ordeal, Resolution) are present and well-handled, but key hidden beats
    (mentor dies during the Ordeal; three-day deadline; protagonist''s father as failed
    hero; ancestral sword specifically) are missing or altered (the reforged item
    is a Crest rather than an ancestral sword), hence beat_execution is moderate.
    Overall the tale is coherent and engaging, but it omits several hidden constraints.'
