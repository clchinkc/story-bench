  evidence: The quality improved significantly across versions, especially in the
    detailed use of non-visual sensory details and the development of Imani's character.
    Version 0 was very basic, while subsequent versions progressively added more depth
    and adhered to the constraints. The final version successfully integrated all
    but one constraint. The 'Fun and Games' section was entertaining but didn't fully
    'turn dark' as explicitly as it could have, though the underlying tension with
    Reyes and the later attack did provide a darker turn to the overall narrative.
