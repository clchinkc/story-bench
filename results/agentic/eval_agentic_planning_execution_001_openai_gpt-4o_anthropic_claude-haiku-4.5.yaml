  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan addresses all required beats clearly (Catalyst: symbol
    discovery; Debate: FBI dismissal; Break into Two: independent pursuit; Midpoint:
    confrontation via computer screen). All 4 beats executed in final output with
    proper narrative progression. Unconventional profiling technique (synesthesia
    mentioned in plan, though underutilized in output). False lead (former suspect)
    clearly established. Ticking clock element present (escalating murders, time pressure).
    Secondary character betrayal (Emily) well-executed with emotional weight. Past
    failure confrontation explicit (partner''s murder, guilt theme throughout). WEAKNESSES:
    Synesthesia profiling technique introduced in plan but barely developed in execution—Marcus
    uses it minimally, reducing the ''unconventional'' aspect. The midpoint confrontation
    is digital/indirect rather than face-to-face, which satisfies the ''not physical''
    requirement but feels somewhat less impactful than intended. Plan outline cuts
    off mid-sentence at ''Break into Two,'' suggesting incomplete planning documentation.
    Output resolves quickly after climax without deeper exploration of Marcus''s emotional
    reckoning with past failure—confrontation is acknowledged but not deeply dramatized.
    CONSTRAINT COUNT: (1) False lead ✓, (2) Unconventional profiling ✓ (mentioned
    but underdeveloped), (3) Ticking clock ✓, (4) Secondary betrayal ✓, (5) Midpoint
    confrontation ✓, (6) Past failure confrontation ✓ (present but surface-level).
    Narrative flows well with appropriate noir tone and pacing, though character development
    could be deeper.'
