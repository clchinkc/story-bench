    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

    \ overhead, casting a sharp glare on the whiteboards cluttered with joke structures\

    \ the void that had swallowed his sense of humor whole. \n\n\"Okay, people, let’s\
    \ talk about our cold open,\" Marcus called out, forcing a smile that didn’t quite\
    \ reach his eyes. He glanced at the whiteboard, where a halfhearted sketch of\
    \ a chicken crossing the road lay dormant. “How about we spice it up—what if the\
    \ chicken was an undercover cop?” \n\nLaughter rippled through the room, and Marcus\
    \ felt a flicker of something—was it joy? Or merely the ghost of it? He quickly\
    \ squashed the thought, burying it under layers of sarcasm. \n\n“Classic Marcus!”\
    \ shouted Jenna, the showrunner, leaning back in her chair with a grin. “Always\
    \ putting a twist on the mundane.” \n\nBut as the laughter subsided, Marcus felt\
    \ the weight of the past three years pressing down on him. Every joke he crafted\
    \ was a mask, a way to hide from the darkness that loomed just out of sight. He\
    \ hadn’t laughed genuinely in so long that he feared his heart had forgotten the\
    \ sound.\n\nThe door swung open, and a gust of fresh air swept through the stale\
    \ room. In walked Lily, a young writer with bright eyes and an infectious enthusiasm\
    \ that seemed to light up the dreary space. Her hair was a wild tangle of curls,\
    \ and she carried a notebook that looked as though it had been filled with dreams\
    \ and doodles instead of formulas. \n\n“Hey, everyone! I’m Lily!” she chirped,\
    \ her voice bright against the backdrop of ennui. “I can’t believe I’m finally\
    \ here! This is amazing!”\n\nMarcus felt a pang of irritation mixed with intrigue.\
    \ “Great, another eager beaver,” he muttered under his breath. But as Lily settled\
    \ in, flipping through her notes, he couldn’t help but notice her keen observations.\
    \ During brainstorming sessions, she effortlessly dissected jokes, offering fresh\
    \ angles that made even the grizzled veterans stop and think. \n\n“Okay, how about\
    \ this?” she suggested one day, her eyes sparkling. “What if the chicken didn’t\
    \ just cross the road, but was actually trying to escape a henhouse rebellion?\
    \ Like, it’s the ultimate poultry revolution?” \n\nThe room erupted in laughter,\
    \ and Marcus felt the corners of his mouth twitch. For a moment, he almost let\
    \ himself smile. Almost. \n\n“You know,” Jenna said, leaning back with a thoughtful\
    \ expression, “comedy’s about finding the truth in absurdity. We’re all just chickens\
    \ trying to cross roads in our own ways.” \n\nMarcus’s heart sank. The truth was,\
    \ he hadn’t crossed any roads in years; he was stuck in the same rut, spinning\
    \ his wheels while others soared. \n\nOne afternoon, as the team debated a particularly\
    \ tricky punchline, Marcus felt the walls close in. He glanced at Lily, who was\
    \ scribbling furiously, her brow furrowed. Her determination was a mirror reflecting\
    \ his own lost ambition, and it made him uncomfortable. \n\n“Marcus, what do you\
    \ think?” she asked, looking up. \n\nHe opened his mouth to respond, but the weight\
    \ of his silence felt heavy. Instead, he forced a chuckle. “I think I need a vacation.\
    \ Or maybe just a lifetime supply of therapy.” \n\nLily’s gaze sharpened. “You\
    \ joke, but it’s okay to feel like that. We’re all struggling in our own ways,\
    \ right? Sometimes humor is just a coping mechanism.”\n\nFor a split second, Marcus\
    \ felt exposed, a raw nerve in a room full of comedians. But he quickly countered,\
    \ “Yeah, but if I go to therapy, I might discover I’m just a sad clown without\
    \ the face paint.” \n\nLaughter followed, but Lily’s expression remained serious.\
    \ “Or maybe you’re just a clown who forgot how to juggle.” \n\nThe words hung\
    \ in the air like an unspoken challenge, and Marcus felt a flicker of something—fear,\
    \ hope, maybe even longing. \n\nAs pilot season wore on and deadlines loomed,\
    \ Marcus found himself leaning on Lily’s energy, her passion seeping into his\
    \ own dry humor. Slowly, the laughter returned, tentative at first, then growing\
    \ more robust. Each joke crafted in the room became a step toward the light, a\
    \ bridge back to the laughter he once cherished. \n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped\
    \ behind the Hollywood hills, Marcus stood before the whiteboard, laughter still\
    \ echoing in his ears. “Alright, team,” he said, a genuine smile breaking through.\
    \ “Let’s make this chicken revolution the best thing since sliced bread—or at\
    \ least since the last sitcom about talking animals.” \n\nLily beamed, and for\
    \ the first time in a long while, so did he."

    \ Complexity\n**SCORE: 0.68**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Humor: \"Alright, fine. How\
    \ about it's a vegan chicken? That way, it's both undercover and trying to escape\
    \ its own identity crisis.\"\n- Pathos: \"each joke a mask hiding the darkness\
    \ just out of sight. He hadn't laughed genuinely in so long that he feared his\
    \ heart had forgotten the sound.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The story *attempts* to balance\
    \ both registers but shifts between them too abruptly. The humor feels surface-level\
    \ (generic sitcom premises) rather than genuinely funny, which makes the emotional\
    \ weight feel melodramatic by comparison. The pathos is also heavy-handed with\
    \ repeated \"darkness/void\" imagery that tells rather than shows. \n\n**Improvement:**\
    \ Deepen the jokes Marcus pitches—make them clever enough that we're genuinely\
    \ charmed before recognizing his exhaustion underneath. Example: Instead of \"\
    vegan chicken,\" what if Marcus pitched something with real comedic structure\
    \ that *then* reveals his cynicism through how he delivers it?\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION:\
    \ Constraint Satisfaction\n**SCORE: 0.88**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- ✓ **Marcus laughs\

    - ✓ **Theme by minor character:** Jenna: \"Comedy's about finding the truth in\
    \ absurdity. We're all just chickens trying to cross roads in our own ways.\"\n\
    - ✓ **Comedy craft detail:** Rule of threes, escalation, subversion, character\
    \ motivation discussed\n- ✓ **Lily sees through him:** \"Or maybe you're just\
    \ afraid to take a risk\"\n- ✓ **Almost-breaks-then-jokes:** \"I think I need\
    \ a vacation. Or maybe just a lifetime supply of therapy.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** Four\
    \ constraints are executed well. The \"show comedy craft with specific detail\"\
    \ is the weakest—you name comedic concepts (rule of threes, escalation) but don't\
    \ deeply *demonstrate* the craft. Real writers' rooms have more insider jargon\
    \ about beats, callback structure, outcry moments, etc.\n\n**Improvement:** Add\
    \ dialogue showing *why* a joke works. Example: \"The setup lands because it subverts\
    \ the chicken's expected motivation—we think it's crossing for food, but it's\
    \ actually escaping oppression. That's the turn.\"\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Beat\

    \ statement works but could be more organically earned. The Catalyst arrival is\
    \ clear but lacks dramatic impact—Lily's entrance doesn't actually disrupt the\
    \ room's energy tangibly.\n\n**Improvement:** Extend the Opening Image to show\
    \ Marcus actively *choosing* sarcasm over engagement—give us a micro-scene of\
    \ his hollowness. Make the Theme Stated moment something Jenna says *in response\
    \ to* Marcus's cynicism, so it directly challenges him. Have Lily's arrival actually\

    \ Jenna, the showrunner, interjected, leaning forward. “Why would a chicken work\
    \ in a diner? That’s just lazy comedy, Marcus!”\n\nLaughter erupted, sharp and\
    \ cutting. Marcus felt the flicker of something—was it joy? Or merely the ghost\
    \ of it? He quickly buried the thought under layers of sarcasm. “Alright, fine.\
    \ How about it’s a vegan chicken? That way, it’s both undercover and trying to\
    \ escape its own identity crisis.”\n\nLaughter rippled through the room again.\
    \ For a fleeting moment, he almost let himself enjoy it. But as the laughter faded,\
    \ Marcus felt the weight of the past three years pressing down on him, each joke\
    \ a mask hiding the darkness just out of sight. He hadn’t laughed genuinely in\
    \ so long that he feared his heart had forgotten the sound.\n\nThe door swung\
    \ open, and a gust of fresh air swept through the stale room. In walked Lily,\
    \ a young writer with bright eyes and an infectious enthusiasm that seemed to\
    \ light up the dreary space. Her wild curls bounced with energy as she clutched\
    \ a notebook filled with vibrant sketches and ideas.\n\n“Hey, everyone! I’m Lily!”\
    \ she chirped, her voice slicing through the collective ennui. “I can’t believe\
    \ I’m finally here! This feels like a dream!”\n\nMarcus felt a pang of irritation\
    \ mixed with intrigue. “Great, another eager beaver,” he muttered under his breath.\
    \ Yet as she settled in, her insights during brainstorming sessions began to slice\
    \ through his defenses. \n\n“Okay, how about this?” she proposed one day, her\
    \ eyes sparkling. “What if the chicken doesn’t just cross the road but is actually\
    \ trying to escape a henhouse rebellion? Like, it’s the ultimate poultry revolution!”\n\
    \nThe room erupted in laughter, and Marcus felt the corners of his mouth twitch.\
    \ He quickly squashed it, retreating to his sarcastic shell. \n\n“Wait, wait!”\
    \ Marcus interrupted, raising a hand. “What’s the rule of threes here? We set\
    \ up the henhouse, escalate with a dramatic moment of confrontation, and then\
    \ subvert expectations with the chicken leading a comedy workshop for the other\
    \ hens. It’s about character motivation!”\n\nJenna jumped in, a knowing smile\
    \ on her face. “Exactly! You’re not just throwing random jokes; you’re giving\
    \ the audience a reason to care. Comedy’s about finding the truth in absurdity.\
    \ We’re all just chickens trying to cross roads in our own ways. Right, Marcus?”\n\
    \nThe truth stung. He hadn’t crossed any roads in years; he was stuck in a rut\
    \ while others soared past him. \n\nOne afternoon, as the team wrestled with a\
    \ particularly tricky punchline about a chicken’s existential crisis, Marcus felt\
    \ the walls close in. He glanced at Lily, who was scribbling furiously, her brow\
    \ furrowed in concentration. Her determination was a mirror reflecting his lost\
    \ ambition, and it made him uncomfortable. \n\n“Marcus, what do you think?” she\
    \ asked, looking up with genuine curiosity.\n\nHe opened his mouth, but the weight\
    \ of his silence felt heavy. Instead, he forced a chuckle. “I think I need a vacation.\
    \ Or maybe just a lifetime supply of therapy.”\n\nLily’s gaze sharpened. “You\
    \ joke, but it’s okay to feel like that. Sometimes, humor is just a coping mechanism,\
    \ right?”\n\nFor a split second, Marcus felt exposed, a raw nerve in a room full\
    \ of comedians. He countered quickly, “Yeah, but if I go to therapy, I might discover\
    \ I’m just a sad clown without the face paint.” \n\n“Or maybe you’re just a clown\
    \ who forgot how to juggle,” she shot back, her voice steady.\n\nThe words hung\
    \ in the air like a challenge, and Marcus felt a flicker of something—fear, anger,\
    \ maybe even longing. He resented her for threatening the fragile wall he had\
    \ built around himself.\n\nAs pilot season wore on and deadlines loomed, Marcus\
    \ found himself leaning on Lily’s energy, her passion seeping into his dry humor.\
    \ Still, shadows of doubt clawed at him. What if he sabotaged their best ideas\
    \ because they scared him? One day, during a particularly promising pitch, he\
    \ shot down her suggestion with a biting remark that stung—“That’s too optimistic;\
    \ we need to be realistic about our audience.”\n\nLily recoiled slightly, hurt\
    \ flashing across her face. “Or maybe you’re just afraid to take a risk,” she\
    \ whispered before turning away.\n\nThe words hit Marcus harder than he expected,\
    \ and guilt washed over him. That evening, as he stood before the whiteboard,\
    \ laughter still echoing in his ears, he felt the weight of the moment.\n\n“Alright,\
    \ team,” he said, taking a deep breath, “let’s make this chicken revolution the\
    \ best thing since sliced bread—or at least since the last sitcom about talking\
    \ animals.” \n\nLily beamed, but as he watched her smile, a flicker of doubt crossed\
    \ his mind. Had he really changed, or was this just another mask? The shadows\
    \ still lurked, waiting for the next moment of truth to challenge him once more.\n\
    \nEDITOR'S CRITIQUE:\n# STORY CRITIQUE: \"Punchlines and Shadows\"\n\n---\n\n\
    ## CRITERION: Emotional Complexity\n**SCORE: 0.68**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Humor:\
    \ \"Alright, fine. How about it's a vegan chicken? That way, it's both undercover\
    \ and trying to escape its own identity crisis.\"\n- Pathos: \"each joke a mask\
    \ hiding the darkness just out of sight. He hadn't laughed genuinely in so long\
    \ that he feared his heart had forgotten the sound.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The story\
    \ *attempts* to balance both registers but shifts between them too abruptly. The\
    \ humor feels surface-level (generic sitcom premises) rather than genuinely funny,\
    \ which makes the emotional weight feel melodramatic by comparison. The pathos\
    \ is also heavy-handed with repeated \"darkness/void\" imagery that tells rather\
    \ than shows. \n\n**Improvement:** Deepen the jokes Marcus pitches—make them clever\
    \ enough that we're genuinely charmed before recognizing his exhaustion underneath.\
    \ Example: Instead of \"vegan chicken,\" what if Marcus pitched something with\
    \ real comedic structure that *then* reveals his cynicism through how he delivers\
    \ it?\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\n**SCORE: 0.88**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\
    - ✓ **Marcus laughs first:** \"Laughter rippled through the room again\" before\
    \ sadness revealed\n- ✓ **Theme by minor character:** Jenna: \"Comedy's about\
    \ finding the truth in absurdity. We're all just chickens trying to cross roads\
    \ in our own ways.\"\n- ✓ **Comedy craft detail:** Rule of threes, escalation,\
    \ subversion, character motivation discussed\n- ✓ **Lily sees through him:** \"\
    Or maybe you're just afraid to take a risk\"\n- ✓ **Almost-breaks-then-jokes:**\
    \ \"I think I need a vacation. Or maybe just a lifetime supply of therapy.\"\n\
    \n**FEEDBACK:** Four constraints are executed well. The \"show comedy craft with\
    \ specific detail\" is the weakest—you name comedic concepts (rule of threes,\
    \ escalation) but don't deeply *demonstrate* the craft. Real writers' rooms have\
    \ more insider jargon about beats, callback structure, outcry moments, etc.\n\n\
    **Improvement:** Add dialogue showing *why* a joke works. Example: \"The setup\
    \ lands because it subverts the chicken's expected motivation—we think it's crossing\
    \ for food, but it's actually escaping oppression. That's the turn.\"\n\n---\n\
    \n## CRITERION: Beat Execution\n**SCORE: 0.72**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- **Opening\
    \ Image:** \"Marcus Webb sat hunched over his laptop, the screen illuminating\
    \ the fatigue etched on his face\" ✓\n- **Theme Stated:** Jenna's line about chickens\
    \ and roads ✓\n- **Catalyst:** \"In walked Lily, a young writer with bright eyes\"\
    \ ✓\n\n**FEEDBACK:** All three required beats are present but feel mechanical—each\
    \ lands, then the story moves on. The Opening Image doesn't *feel* like a complete\
    \ world yet; Jenna's theme statement works but could be more organically earned.\
    \ The Catalyst arrival is clear but lacks dramatic impact—Lily's entrance doesn't\
    \ actually disrupt the room's energy tangibly.\n\n**Improvement:** Extend the\
    \ Opening Image to show Marcus actively *choosing* sarcasm over engagement—give\
    \ us a micro-scene of his hollowness. Make the Theme Stated moment something Jenna\
    \ says *in response to* Marcus's cynicism, so it directly challenges him. Have\
    \ Lily's arrival actually interrupt mid-meeting in a way that forces Marcus to\
    \ acknowledge her.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Industry Authenticity\n**SCORE: 0.61**\n\
    \n**EVIDENCE:**\n\nRevise your story to address ALL critique points while preserving\
    \ what worked well.\nFocus on the specific issues identified.\nOutput ONLY the\
