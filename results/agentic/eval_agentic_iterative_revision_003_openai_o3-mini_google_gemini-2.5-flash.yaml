  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions. Version 0 was a basic
    setup. Version 1 introduced 'hints of internal conflict' but still 'told' rather
    than 'showed'. Version 2 started to show more by describing his daily routine
    and the 'quiet determination'. Version 3 and the final output successfully integrated
    the 'show, not tell' for internal conflict through the notebook and the 'chained
    by duty and stirred by longing' description. The grandmother's moment was introduced
    and refined, and Luis's understanding was added. Cultural elements were present
    from the start and enhanced. The resolution was added in the final version, making
    it earned. The only constraint not fully met is the 'one adult must genuinely
    understand Mateo's dilemma' - Luis is a friend, not an adult. While Doña Elena's
    words are understanding, they are more about general life wisdom than specifically
    understanding his dilemma to leave.
