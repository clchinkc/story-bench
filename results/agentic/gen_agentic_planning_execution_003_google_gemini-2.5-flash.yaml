  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

  content: 'The scent of garlic, sesame, and fermented chili clung to David Park like
    a second skin. At 50, his hands, calloused and nimble, moved with practiced grace
    over the cutting board, slicing daikon for *kkakdugi*. The kitchen of “Seoul Heart”
    hummed with the familiar symphony of his life: the gentle hiss of a gas range,
    the rhythmic thud of his knife. It was a worn kitchen, but every stain, every
    chipped tile, held a memory. He glanced up, his gaze drawn to a framed photo tucked
    between a stack of take-out menus and a spice rack. Hana, his late wife, smiled
    back, her eyes crinkling at the corners. He didn''t reach for it, just held the
    image in his mind, a silent acknowledgment of the void she’d left. This restaurant,
    their restaurant, was her enduring presence.


    A crumpled notice, taped askew to the cash register by the front door, mocked
    the tranquility. "Eminent Domain – Highway Expansion Project. Demolition: 7 Days."
    Seven days to dismantle 25 years. Seven days until the heart of Seoul Heart was
    ripped out. David sighed, the sound barely audible over the bubbling kimchi stew.
    The careful, almost meditative preparation of the banchan – the vibrant red of
    the kimchi, the earthy green of sautéed spinach, the crisp white of pickled radish
    – felt like an act of defiance against the inevitable. Each dish was a cornerstone
    of his identity, a taste of home, a tangible link to a past he wasn''t ready to
    relinquish.


    The bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of Mr. Henderson. The
    old man, a fixture at the corner booth for nearly two decades, nodded a familiar
    greeting. David had already placed a cup of barley tea and a small plate of his
    special *kimchi-jjim* at his usual spot. Mr. Henderson surveyed the emptying dining
    room. "Another one bites the dust, eh, David?" he said, his voice raspy. "The
    old laundromat, the hardware store… now you. This neighborhood won''t know itself
    soon." He paused, stirring his tea. "What''s next for you, David? You going to
    fight it?"


    David merely shrugged, a noncommittal gesture that hid a whirlwind of indecision.
    Fight? Retire? Relocate? Each option felt like a betrayal. The restaurant wasn''t
    just a business; it was the stage for his life, the place he’d met Hana, the walls
    that had echoed with their daughter Mia’s laughter.


    The ringing of his cell phone, a jarring modern intrusion, broke the quiet. He
    recognized the number immediately: Mia. He hadn''t spoken to her in months, not
    since the argument. That argument, like so many others, had been about his perceived
    stubbornness, his inability to move on. He''d missed her college graduation, convinced
    himself the restaurant needed him more, and in doing so, pushed her further away.
    He answered, his voice gruff. "Mia."


    "Appa," her voice was softer than he expected, laced with an unfamiliar urgency.
    "I heard about the restaurant. The demolition. Are you okay?"


    "I’m fine," he lied, wiping his hands on his apron. "Just… busy."


    "Appa, this is it. This is your chance. Come to California. With me. You can cook,
    sure, but not like this. No memories, no ghosts." Her words, meant to be comforting,
    stung. *No ghosts.* As if Hana was a burden to be shed.


    "This restaurant is not ghosts, Mia. It is… everything." He heard the defensiveness
    in his own voice, the familiar wall going up.


    "It''s a building, Appa. It can be rebuilt. *You* can be rebuilt. Don''t fight
    this. Don''t cling to the past." Her voice tightened. "Just… think about it. Please."


    He grunted a noncommittal response and hung up. He looked around the empty restaurant,
    the worn wooden tables, the faded wallpaper with its delicate floral pattern.
    Mia was right, in a way. It was just a building. But it was *their* building.
    And the thought of leaving it felt like abandoning a part of himself, a part of
    Hana. His gaze fell back to the photograph, the gentle curve of Hana''s smile.
    He turned back to the cutting board, picking up his knife once more. There were
    still banchan to prepare, a final week of meals to serve. The clatter of his knife
    against wood filled the silence, a lonely, defiant rhythm.'
