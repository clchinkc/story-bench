  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The revision trajectory shows strong engagement
    with feedback. Version 3 demonstrates clear response to constraint concerns by:
    (1) transforming the fog metaphor from passive atmosphere (''like a shroud'')
    to active narrative device (''with the persistence of a crime scene—impossible
    to read, yet full of information she couldn''t access''), directly addressing
    the fog''s narrative purpose. (2) Expanding methodical action sequences (notebook
    cataloging, footprint analysis, body examination) to exceed initial demonstrations.
    (3) Introducing Old Harlan Fisk''s evasiveness and boat damage as concrete secret-bearing
    character work. Critiques 1-3 showed escalating constraint satisfaction scores
    (0.80→0.90→0.95), indicating responsive iteration.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Quality demonstrably improved across revisions. Early
    versions relied on exposition (''her old failure flashing like a faulty deduction'').
    Final version embeds past case hints organically through: the Boston poster Sarah
    ''noted and filed away,'' Victor Hale''s business card triggering recognition,
    and the wrongful arrest backstory revealed through action consequences rather
    than summary. The fog evolved from decorative to functional—it now actively conceals
    evidence, delays discovery, and becomes a suspect variable in Sarah''s analysis.
    The ending shifted from implicit to explicit decision moment (''she decided—she
    would chase this thread''), satisfying the constraint more deliberately.


    PRESERVATION: Strengths maintained throughout: (1) Sarah''s methodical voice preserved
    and deepened—the notebook work, variable cataloging, and logical elimination process
    remain consistent anchors. (2) Atmospheric prose quality sustained—''weathered
    boats bobbed listlessly,'' ''fog-shrouded form,'' ''faces shadowed and wary''
    maintain literary quality. (3) Pacing and structure preserved while adding depth.
    Minor concern: the final paragraph''s decision moment, while explicit, slightly
    rushes the emotional weight (''Logic dictated caution. But the facts demanded
    pursuit'')—could benefit from one more beat of internal conflict.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5): (1) Methodical nature through action: ✓ Notebook
    adjustments, tide/wind cataloging, footprint sketching, body examination, mental
    database cross-referencing all demonstrate methodology without exposition. (2)
    Fog serves narrative purpose: ✓ Fog conceals evidence, delays discovery, becomes
    a calculated variable in Sarah''s analysis, and thematically mirrors her inability
    to ''read'' the past. (3) Local character with secret: ✓ Old Harlan Fisk exhibits
    evasiveness, nervous eye-darting, boat damage inconsistent with weather—clear
    secret-bearing behavior. (4) Past case hinted before revelation: ✓ Boston poster,
    ''old ghosts,'' rain-slicked alley memory, then Victor Hale''s card triggers full
    backstory reveal. (5) Ends on decision, not resolution: ✓ Final paragraph explicitly
    presents three variables and Sarah''s choice to pursue, leaving investigation
    open.


    BEAT EXECUTION (3/3 required beats): (1) Inciting incident (body discovery): ✓
    Executed with methodical detail and fog-based concealment. (2) Complication (past
    case connection): ✓ Victor Hale''s identity and Boston precinct card create immediate
    stakes. (3) Decision point: ✓ Three-variable analysis leading to explicit choice
    to investigate despite emotional bias.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong prose with occasional overreach. Strengths: metaphorical
    fog work, Sarah''s voice consistency, pacing. Weaknesses: the final decision paragraph
    feels slightly rushed after the measured buildup; ''Logic dictated caution. But
    the facts demanded pursuit'' is somewhat tell-y after pages of showing. The phrase
    ''aligning the facts like dominoes'' is slightly mixed metaphor. Overall engagement
    is high—reader is drawn into Sarah''s methodical process and invested in the mystery''s
    personal stakes.'
