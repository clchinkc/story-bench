  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing character
    arcs, symbolic elements, and how each constraint will be met. The final output
    adheres perfectly to this detailed plan. All six constraints are satisfied: food
    symbolism (kimchi, bibimbap), implicit grief (empty chair, Jesa, ''kept her''),
    specific cause for estrangement (thesis show, choosing restaurant over daughter),
    regular customer (Elias representing change), hopeful but not unrealistic ending
    (visit to California, not moving in), and Korean cultural element (Jesa, Dolsot
    Bibimbap, barley tea). All three beats (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution) are
    clearly executed. The narrative quality is very strong, with good pacing and emotional
    depth.'
