  evidence: The quality improved significantly across versions. Version 0 was a basic
    setup. Version 1 added more specific details and hinted at the internal conflict.
    Version 2 refined the language and added the 'crumpled flyer' as a concrete representation
    of his dream. Version 3 further refined the language and added the 'velas and
    saints' for cultural authenticity. The final output successfully integrated all
    constraints and developed a compelling narrative. The internal conflict is shown
    through Mateo's actions and thoughts (tracing the flyer, the ring burning, his
    internal monologue). The grandmother's moment is specific and impactful. Mr. Rivera
    genuinely understands Mateo's dilemma. Cultural elements are authentic and woven
    into the fabric of the story. The resolution is earned through Mateo's growth
    and his decisive actions.
