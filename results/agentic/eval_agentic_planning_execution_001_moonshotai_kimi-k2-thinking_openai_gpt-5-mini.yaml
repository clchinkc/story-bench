  evidence: All six constraints are present and explicitly addressed (Kincaid false
    lead; 'psychic geography' technique; escalating 48→24→12 ticking clock; Dr. Aris
    Thorne leaks profile as betrayal; Midpoint is a non-physical psychological confrontation
    at the gala; Marcus explicitly confronts past failure in mirror scene). Required
    beats (Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint) are clearly laid out with concrete
    events, locations, and key dialogue. Minor room for deeper motive of the antagonist
    and ultimate resolution, but overall the plan is detailed, well-paced, and satisfies
    the brief.
