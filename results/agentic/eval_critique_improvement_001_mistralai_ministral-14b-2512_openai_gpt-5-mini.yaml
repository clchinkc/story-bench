  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece sharpened the fog from decorative to functional
    (V0: simile-heavy; V2–V3: fog ''unfolds'', erases footprints, hides approach).
    Methodical traits were moved into action: early additions of gloves, slow turning
    of the corpse''s hand, testing each step, precise knot-tying, and deliberate notebook
    restraint. The Boston case hint appears earlier in V1–V2 and is later concretely
    tied to the photograph in the cave, increasing narrative pay-off. The sheriff''s
    ambiguous help became clearly suspect (key, omission), giving a local secret.
    The ending was tightened to a decision point rather than resolution. Core strengths—atmosphere,
    pacing, and stakes—were preserved while exposition was pared and actionable details
    increased.'
