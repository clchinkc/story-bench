  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece preserved its strongest elements (Gull-Glider
    invention, vivid post-climate setting, clear danger in the crossing) while addressing
    some critique points: the mentor’s specific flaw (fear/trauma around open water)
    is explicit, the crossing contains real peril (cave-in, siphon, near-drowning),
    and an adult (Birk) initially dismisses Zara. However, responsiveness to the repeated
    youth_voice critiques is partial: more dialogue and physicalized reactions were
    kept or added, but several narrator-level metaphors and observations (e.g., “Each
    fresh page made her ribs fizz…”, some omniscient narration) still read older than
    a fully authentic twelve-year-old voice. Overall revisions produced modest, consistent
    improvements without sacrificing core strengths.'
