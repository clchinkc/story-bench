  evidence: 'The plan is comprehensive, detailing specific behaviors for isolation,
    characteristics of the alien signal, and clear setups for the mentor and colleague.
    The execution largely follows the plan, with minor deviations that enhance the
    story (e.g., Jin as an unconventional mentor, rather than a ''punk rock'' one).
    All constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through actions (nutrient
    paste, back to door, jargon); the signal is genuinely alien (quantum-entangled,
    recursive math, temporal displacement); Dr. Webb challenges Yuki''s approach;
    Jin and her mother serve as unconventional mentors; the threshold is psychological
    (merging consciousness, dissolving isolation); and the moment of human connection
    (Jin holding Yuki''s hand) is surprising and impactful. All beats are clearly
    executed. The narrative quality is high, with good pacing and emotional depth.'
