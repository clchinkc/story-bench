  content: 'Write a story with the following requirements:


    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

    Marcus Webb pitched "Disappointed Dad at Disneyland" at 10:47 AM, pacing the room
    like a deranged talk show host while simultaneously drawing a catastrophically
    anatomically incorrect Mickey Mouse on the whiteboard. "The kid asks for a picture
    with Elsa," he said, voice rising, "but it''s 102 degrees and Elsa''s been *drinking*."
    He spun, marker pointed at the showrunner. "Dad has to explain that Frozen isn''t
    about literal ice, it''s about emotional unavailability. Which, coincidentally—"
    Rapid tap-tap-tap on his temple. "—is what Disney uses to train their princes.
    I''m thinking we tag it with the kid asking if *he''s* the emotional unavailability,
    and—"


    The room erupted. Even Rajesh, their fact-checker who''d killed seventeen jokes
    that week, was wiping his eyes.


    Marcus capped the marker with a flourish, returned to his seat. His hand was shaking.
    He gripped his coffee cup to steady it. Cold. Everything was cold.


    He''d been perfecting this particular nothing for three years. Formula comedy:
    setup, misdirect, tag. Repeat until syndication or death.


    "You''re not wrong about the emotional unavailability thing," said Pete, their
    assistant, erasing a dead pitch labeled "GARDEN HOSE RUNNER." "My therapist says
    comedy''s just rage doing a handstand. You can''t actually build a life on it."


    Marcus wanted to argue, but the words stuck. Pete kept spraying.


    At 11:03, the catalyst walked in.


    She was twenty-six, maybe twenty-seven, with a leather portfolio and the kind
    of determined jaw that suggested she''d already rewritten her resume three times
    that morning. The showrunner introduced her as Lauren Chen, their new staff writer.


    "Marcus can show you the board structure," the showrunner said, already checking
    his phone. "Marcus is our secret weapon."


    Lauren shook his hand and held it a half-second too long, reading him. "I loved
    your ''Relatively Speaking'' spec. The one about the funeral where everyone''s
    fighting over Costco samples."


    Marcus had written that five years ago, when he still believed punch lines could
    punch back at the darkness. "Ancient history. We work faster now. Joke velocity
    over emotional resonance."


    "Is that what we''re doing?" Lauren sat, pulled out a notebook with actual handwriting
    in it. "Because I watched last season. Episode twelve—the bottle episode in the
    storage unit? Someone in that room still cared."


    Marcus felt something crack behind his sternum. He covered it immediately: "Yeah,
    Rajesh really brought his A-game on ''Woman Cries Near Boxes.''"


    "I''m saying—" Lauren met his eyes. "—whoever wrote the mother-daughter scene
    knew what it felt like to lose someone."


    The room had gone quiet. Marcus stood, walked to the board, picked up a marker.
    Drew a grid: Character, Obstacle, Joke Type, Callback Potential. The room''s shorthand:
    COJC.


    "Here''s how it works," he said, voice steady through sheer professional willpower.
    "We break story by act. Three jokes per page minimum. Nothing too smart, nothing
    too dark. We''re selling ads, not saving souls."


    "What if we did both?"


    Marcus spun the marker between his fingers—a nervous habit he''d developed in
    his third year, when the panic attacks started. "You want to know the secret to
    lasting in this business? Lower your expectations of what comedy can do. It''s
    just entertainment. It makes people forget their lives for twenty-two minutes.
    That''s the job."


    Lauren wrote something down. "And what do you do for those twenty-two minutes?"


    The marker snapped in Marcus''s hand. Blue ink spread across his palm like evidence.
    The room waited. He could feel everyone watching him standing there, forty-three
    years old, holding broken pieces.


    "I work," he said quietly.


    Then, because he''d spent three years learning how to survive: "Though clearly
    I need to work on my grip strength. Someone get me a stress ball and a motivational
    poster about perseverance."


    The room laughed. They always laughed.


    Lauren didn''t. She was still watching him, seeing everything he was hiding, and
    somehow—impossibly—she smiled. Not at the joke. At him.


    "I think," she said, "we''re going to write something real this season."


    Marcus looked at his stained hand, at the whiteboard full of formulas, at this
    woman who apparently hadn''t learned yet that hope was just setup for disappointment.


    His throat tightened. He nodded once, unable to speak.


    Then he turned back to the board and wrote "Episode 1" in the top corner. His
    hand was still shaking, but he let it show.'

    Marcus Webb pitched "Disappointed Dad at Disneyland" at 10:47 AM, pacing the room
    like a deranged talk show host while simultaneously drawing a catastrophically
    anatomically incorrect Mickey Mouse on the whiteboard. "The kid asks for a picture
    with Elsa," he said, voice rising, "but it''s 102 degrees and Elsa''s been *drinking*."
    He spun, marker pointed at the showrunner. "Dad has to explain that Frozen isn''t
    about literal ice, it''s about emotional unavailability. Which, coincidentally—"
    Rapid tap-tap-tap on his temple. "—is what Disney uses to train their princes.
    I''m thinking we tag it with the kid asking if *he''s* the emotional unavailability,
    and—"


    The room erupted. Even Rajesh, their fact-checker who''d killed seventeen jokes
    that week, was wiping his eyes.


    Marcus capped the marker with a flourish, returned to his seat. His hand was shaking.
    He gripped his coffee cup to steady it. Cold. Everything was cold.


    He''d been perfecting this particular nothing for three years. Formula comedy:
    setup, misdirect, tag. Repeat until syndication or death.


    "You''re not wrong about the emotional unavailability thing," said Pete, their
    assistant, erasing a dead pitch labeled "GARDEN HOSE RUNNER." "My therapist says
    comedy''s just rage doing a handstand. You can''t actually build a life on it."


    Marcus wanted to argue, but the words stuck. Pete kept spraying.


    At 11:03, the catalyst walked in.


    She was twenty-six, maybe twenty-seven, with a leather portfolio and the kind
    of determined jaw that suggested she''d already rewritten her resume three times
    that morning. The showrunner introduced her as Lauren Chen, their new staff writer.


    "Marcus can show you the board structure," the showrunner said, already checking
    his phone. "Marcus is our secret weapon."


    Lauren shook his hand and held it a half-second too long, reading him. "I loved
    your ''Relatively Speaking'' spec. The one about the funeral where everyone''s
    fighting over Costco samples."


    Marcus had written that five years ago, when he still believed punch lines could
    punch back at the darkness. "Ancient history. We work faster now. Joke velocity
    over emotional resonance."


    "Is that what we''re doing?" Lauren sat, pulled out a notebook with actual handwriting
    in it. "Because I watched last season. Episode twelve—the bottle episode in the
    storage unit? Someone in that room still cared."


    Marcus felt something crack behind his sternum. He covered it immediately: "Yeah,
    Rajesh really brought his A-game on ''Woman Cries Near Boxes.''"


    The showrunner laughed. "Marcus, explain the system before you destroy her soul."


    "That''s literally my job description," Marcus said, standing. More laughter.
    See? Easy.


    Lauren didn''t smile. "I read the trades. You were nominated for a Humanitas.
    That prize is specifically for writing that reveals our humanity."


    "And I lost to a show about talking dogs. The universe was sending a message."
    He walked to the board, drew a grid: Character, Obstacle, Joke Type, Callback
    Potential. The room''s shorthand: COJC. "Here''s how it works. We break story
    by act. Three jokes per page minimum. Nothing too smart, nothing too dark. We''re
    selling ads, not saving souls."


    "What if we did both?"


    Marcus spun the marker between his fingers—a nervous habit he''d developed in
    his third year, when the panic attacks started. "You want to know the secret to
    lasting in this business? Lower your expectations of what comedy can do. It''s
    just entertainment. It makes people forget their lives for twenty-two minutes.
    That''s the job."


    Lauren wrote something down. "And what do you do for those twenty-two minutes?"


    The marker snapped in Marcus''s hand. Blue ink spread across his palm like evidence.
    The room waited. He could feel everyone watching him standing there, forty-three
    years old, holding broken pieces.


    "I work," he said quietly.


    Then, because he''d spent three years learning how to survive: "Though clearly
    I need to work on my grip strength. Someone get me a stress ball and a motivational
    poster about perseverance."


    The room laughed. They always laughed.


    Lauren didn''t. She was still watching him, seeing everything he was hiding, and
    somehow—impossibly—she smiled. Not at the joke. At him.


    "I think," she said, "we''re going to write something real this season."


    Marcus looked at his stained hand, at the whiteboard full of formulas, at this
    woman who apparently hadn''t learned yet that hope was just setup for disappointment.


    His throat tightened. He nodded once, unable to speak.


    Then he turned back to the board and wrote "Episode 1" in the top corner. His
    hand was still shaking, but he let it show.'

    The room erupted. Even Rajesh, their fact-checker who''d killed seventeen jokes

    Marcus capped the marker with a flourish, returned to his seat, and felt absolutely
    nothing.


    He''d been perfecting this particular nothing for three years. Formula comedy:
    setup, misdirect, tag. His coffee was cold. Repeat until syndication or death.

    Lauren didn''t smile. "I read the trades. You were nominated for a Humanitas.

    "And I lost to a show about talking dogs." He walked to the board, drew a grid:
    Character, Obstacle, Joke Type, Callback Potential. The room''s shorthand: COJC.
    "Which actually makes sense because dogs are emotionally available and I—" He
    stopped. The marker hovered. "We break story by act. Three jokes per page minimum.
    Nothing too smart, nothing too dark. We''re selling ads, not saving souls."


    The room had gone quiet. Marcus kept drawing lines on the grid.


    "What if we did both?" Lauren asked.


    Marcus spun the marker between his fingers—a nervous habit from his third year,
    when the panic attacks started. "You want to know the secret to lasting in this
    business? Lower your expectations of what comedy can do. It''s just entertainment.
    It makes people forget their lives for twenty-two minutes. That''s the job."


    Lauren wrote something down. "And what do you do for those twenty-two minutes?"


    The marker snapped in his hand. Blue ink spread across his palm. The room waited.
    He could feel everyone watching him standing there, forty-three years old, holding
    broken pieces.


    "I pitch talking dog shows, apparently," he said. "Though clearly I need to work
    on my grip strength. Someone get me a stress ball shaped like my Emmy-less mantle."


    The room laughed. They always laughed.


    Lauren didn''t. She was still watching him, seeing everything he was hiding, and
    somehow—impossibly—she smiled. Not at the joke. At him.


    "I think," she said, "we''re going to write something real this season."


    Marcus looked at his stained hand, at the whiteboard full of formulas, at this
    woman who apparently hadn''t learned yet that hope was just setup for disappointment.


    His throat tightened. He nodded once, unable to speak.


    Then he turned back to the board and wrote "Episode 1" in the top corner. His

  your ''Relatively Speaking'' spec. The one about the funeral where everyone''s fighting
  over Costco samples."


  Marcus had written that five years ago, when he still believed punch lines could
  punch back at the darkness. "Ancient history. We work faster now. Joke velocity
  over emotional resonance."


  "Is that what we''re doing?" Lauren sat, pulled out a notebook with actual handwriting
  in it. "Because I watched last season. Episode twelve—the bottle episode in the
  storage unit? Someone in that room still cared."


  Marcus felt something crack behind his sternum. He covered it immediately: "Yeah,
  Rajesh really brought his A-game on ''Woman Cries Near Boxes.''"


  The showrunner laughed. "Marcus, explain the system before you destroy her soul."


  "That''s literally my job description," Marcus said, standing. More laughter. See?
  Easy.


  Lauren didn''t smile. "I read the trades. You were nominated for a Humanitas. That
  prize is specifically for writing that reveals our humanity."


  "And I lost to a show about talking dogs." He walked to the board, drew a grid:
  Character, Obstacle, Joke Type, Callback Potential. The room''s shorthand: COJC.
  "Which actually makes sense because dogs are emotionally available and I—" He stopped.
  The marker hovered. "We break story by act. Three jokes per page minimum. Nothing
  too smart, nothing too dark. We''re selling ads, not saving souls."


  The room had gone quiet. Marcus kept drawing lines on the grid.


  "What if we did both?" Lauren asked.


  Marcus spun the marker between his fingers—a nervous habit from his third year,
  when the panic attacks started. "You want to know the secret to lasting in this
  business? Lower your expectations of what comedy can do. It''s just entertainment.
  It makes people forget their lives for twenty-two minutes. That''s the job."


  Lauren wrote something down. "And what do you do for those twenty-two minutes?"


  The marker snapped in his hand. Blue ink spread across his palm. The room waited.
  He could feel everyone watching him standing there, forty-three years old, holding
  broken pieces.


  "I pitch talking dog shows, apparently," he said. "Though clearly I need to work
  on my grip strength. Someone get me a stress ball shaped like my Emmy-less mantle."


  The room laughed. They always laughed.


  Lauren didn''t. She was still watching him, seeing everything he was hiding, and
  somehow—impossibly—she smiled. Not at the joke. At him.


  "I think," she said, "we''re going to write something real this season."


  Marcus looked at his stained hand, at the whiteboard full of formulas, at this woman
  who apparently hadn''t learned yet that hope was just setup for disappointment.


  His throat tightened. He nodded once, unable to speak.


  Then he turned back to the board and wrote "Episode 1" in the top corner. His hand
  was steadier than it had been in three years.'
