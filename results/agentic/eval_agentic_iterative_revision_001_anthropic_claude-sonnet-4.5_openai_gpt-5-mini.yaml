  evidence: 'Versions 0–3 presented the same opening hook but were truncated; the
    final version expands that hook into a complete scene that preserves the original
    opening while adding emotional development, a clear catalyst (Sarah), and a closing
    that leaves the reader uncertain. The SOFA score and the incorrect discharge dosage
    appear early and remain relevant to the plot, satisfying the medical-detail requirement.
    Competence is shown up front (catching the dosage error, meticulous work), then
    a personal flaw (social isolation) is revealed and explored through the Sarah
    friendship arc, which grows organically—coffee, repeated visits, a shared dinner—so
    the friendship feels earned. The transformation is shown internally (surprise
    at laughter, feeling the warmth of a touch, reconsidering priorities) rather than
    through any external makeover. The ending is deliberately ambiguous: Elena sets
    the phone face-down and returns to work, so the reader is left unsure whether
    she has truly changed. Overall quality improved from a fragment to a polished
    scene, retaining good elements (voice, detail) while addressing the story requirements.'
