  evidence: 'The plan is complete and specific, addressing all constraints and beats.
    The final output adheres well to the plan. Most constraints are satisfied: false
    lead, unconventional profiling, ticking clock, secondary character betrayal, midpoint
    confrontation, and past failure confrontation. The only constraint not fully met
    is the ''ticking clock'' which is mentioned but not strongly integrated into the
    narrative''s tension. The beats are all present and executed as planned. The narrative
    quality is good, with decent pacing and tension, though the ticking clock could
    have been more impactful.'
