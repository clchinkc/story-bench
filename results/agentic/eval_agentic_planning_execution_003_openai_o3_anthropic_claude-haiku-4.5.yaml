  evidence: 'PLAN PHASE: Exceptionally detailed outline with clear three-act structure,
    specific day-by-day progression, and explicit callouts for all constraints. Beat-by-beat
    breakdown is concrete (e.g., ''barley tea ritual,'' ''Mr. Alvarez 20-year customer,''
    ''han vs. jeong argument''). Minor gap: plan mentions ''historical review'' resolution
    but doesn''t fully detail the mechanism.


    OUTPUT EXECUTION: Story faithfully follows plan with strong adherence. Opening
    image matches (barley tea, wife''s photo, cold cup). Inciting incident clear (demolition
    notice). Grace''s estrangement cause is specific and believable (refused to leave
    kitchen for eulogy). Mr. Alvarez represents continuity/memory and triggers David''s
    emotional reckoning.


    CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:

    1. Food symbolic (2x): ✓ Barley tea (grief/ritual), jangajji burial (redemption/transformation).
    Both carry thematic weight beyond nutrition.

    2. David''s grief (implicit): ✓ Conveyed through cold tea, wife''s photo, silence
    at meeting, tears during smoke scene. Never stated directly.

    3. Daughter''s estrangement (specific cause): ✓ Grace didn''t attend culinary
    school due to loans; David chose restaurant over eulogy. Believable and concrete.

    4. Regular customer (symbolic): ✓ Mr. Alvarez represents 20 years of continuity;
    his collapse forces David''s reckoning; his memory of proposal anchors the stakes.

    5. Hopeful but realistic ending: ✓ 60-day stay (not full victory), Grace and David
    reconciling but still uncertain (''wherever later is''), shared barley tea suggests
    healing without guaranteeing future.

    6. Korean cultural element beyond food: ✓ ''Han'' and ''jeong'' explicitly discussed
    as philosophical concepts; temple incense simile; kneeling ritual; clay jar burial
    practice.


    BEAT EXECUTION:

    - Act 1 Setup (Days 1-2): ✓ Establishes David''s routine, demolition threat, Grace''s
    distance, Mr. Alvarez''s role, David''s refusal to act.

    - Act 2 Confrontation (Days 3-5): ✓ Grace arrives, cooking tension, philosophical
    clash (han/jeong), Mr. Alvarez''s medical crisis, Grace''s accusation about funeral,
    David''s emotional breakdown (blackened galbi).

    - Act 3 Resolution (Days 6-7): ✓ Sidewalk service goes viral, Grace speaks publicly
    (reclaiming her voice), 60-day stay granted, burial ritual, departure with shared
    tea.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is lyrical and precise (''soy sauce shimmering on the
    verge of boiling over,'' ''hashtags bloomed''). Pacing accelerates appropriately
    through Act 2. Tension between father/daughter feels earned. Sensory details anchor
    emotion. Ending balances hope (stay granted, reconciliation) with realism (uncertainty
    remains, ''wherever later is'').


    MINOR WEAKNESSES: The viral moment (livestream/hashtags) feels slightly convenient—could
    have been more organically earned. The alderman''s sudden reversal lacks one scene
    showing political pressure building. Grace''s character arc is strong but could
    use one more moment of her own vulnerability before the milk crate speech.'
