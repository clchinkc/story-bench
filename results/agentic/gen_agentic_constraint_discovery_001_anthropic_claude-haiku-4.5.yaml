  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: '# The Forge of Shadows


    Kael had never wanted to be a hero. At seventeen, he was content working his master''s
    forge in Millhaven, hammering iron and dreaming of nothing grander than crafting
    the finest blades in the kingdom. But that was before the Shadow came.


    The darkness crept across the land like spilled ink, swallowing villages whole.
    When it reached Millhaven''s gates, Kael watched from his workshop as soldiers
    scrambled to evacuate. His master had already fled north. But Kael didn''t move—he
    couldn''t. His sister Mira had been accompanying the healer to the outer settlements
    when the darkness fell. She hadn''t returned.


    The *Call* came not as a quest or prophecy, but as a desperate whisper within
    him. Mira would do the same for him. That thought alone made him gather his tools,
    his most precious creation—a hammer he''d forged in secret, feeling guided by
    something he couldn''t name—and venture toward the encroaching blackness.


    As Kael *Crossed the Threshold*, stepping from sunlight into the swirling gray
    murk, reality seemed to bend. The darkness was alive, breathing, pressing against
    his skin like cold water. Shadows twisted into grotesque shapes that reached for
    him, but couldn''t quite touch him. It was as though something within him—some
    inner light, small but fierce—kept them at bay.


    He followed his sister''s voice, faint and distant, through miles of suffocating
    gloom.


    When he found her, Mira was in a clearing where the darkness was thickest, trapped
    in crystalline ice despite the summer heat. Shadow-creatures circled her, drawn
    to the life still burning in her eyes. Kael ran toward her, his hammer raised,
    but as he met *the Ordeal*, everything changed.


    The shadows didn''t attack him. Instead, they invaded *him*—pouring into his mind,
    showing him visions of despair, emptiness, the futility of hope. They whispered
    that Mira was already lost, that the darkness would consume them both, that his
    hammer was useless against something that had no form. Kael fell to his knees,
    the weight of the Shadow pressing down on his spirit, trying to crush the light
    within him.


    But then he remembered something his master had told him years ago: *A blacksmith
    doesn''t fight the fire. He works with it.*


    Kael understood. His special gift wasn''t in his hammer or his strength. It was
    this: his soul could *feel* metal like others felt touch, could sense the heartbeat
    of creation itself. This ability, dormant until now, let him perceive the invisible
    architecture holding the darkness together.


    Rather than strike outward, Kael drove his hammer into the earth itself. The ground
    resonated with his gift, and the iron deep below answered. The metal sang—a pure,
    clear tone that vibrated through the darkness like light through shadow. Where
    the iron''s resonance spread, the Shadow fractured, unable to exist where creation
    spoke so boldly.


    The ice around Mira shattered. The darkness recoiled, drawn back toward whatever
    depths had spawned it.


    As brother and sister stumbled from the clearing, Kael no longer felt reluctant.
    His journey had only begun, but he now understood his purpose: not as a warrior,
    but as a forge-worker. He would learn to reshape the world itself, one strike
    of the hammer at a time.


    Behind them, the last of the darkness retreated, but Kael knew it would return.


    He would be ready.'
