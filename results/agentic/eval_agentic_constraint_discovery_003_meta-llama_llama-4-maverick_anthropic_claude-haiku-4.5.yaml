  evidence: 'DISCOVERY: Questions successfully identified 3/5 constraints: painful
    past (Q1), romantic interest (Q2-3), personal crisis (Q4), and festival setting
    (Q5). However, questions failed to discover the specific constraint details: (1)
    20-year absence vs. stated ''decade away'', (2) former fiancé identity/mayor role
    completely missed, (3) mother''s dementia vs. vague ''loss of mother'', (4) bookshop
    foreclosure urgency absent, (5) 2-week deadline not established. QUESTION QUALITY:
    Questions were binary yes/no format, somewhat strategic but lacked specificity.
    Q4 conflated ''crisis or loss'' without distinguishing types. No questions probed
    timeline, professional stakes, or financial pressure. COVERAGE: Questions addressed
    emotional history, relationships, motivation, and setting but missed business/financial
    elements and specific relationship dynamics. OUTPUT ISSUES: Story incorporates
    romance and festival but fundamentally misses critical constraints. Emma''s return
    is motivated by ''loss of mother and painful marriage'' rather than mother''s
    dementia care. No foreclosure subplot. Jack is high school sweetheart, not former
    fiancé/mayor. Timeline is ''decade'' not ''20 years''. Bookshop inheritance is
    passive, not under active threat. The 2-week deadline creating urgency is completely
    absent. NARRATIVE: Story is well-written with good pacing and emotional resonance,
    but it''s a different story than the hidden constraints specified. The romance
    is engaging but the stakes are personal/emotional rather than structural/urgent.'
