  evidence: The revisions successfully integrated the feedback, particularly regarding
    the emotional complexity and the new writer's role. The initial versions lacked
    the depth and the specific moments requested. Version 3 clearly shows Marcus making
    us laugh before revealing his sadness, the theme is stated by Pete (a minor character),
    the craft of comedy writing is detailed, Zoe is not naive, and Marcus almost breaks
    but covers it with a joke. The story's emotional arc became much clearer and more
    impactful, demonstrating a strong improvement trajectory. The core strengths of
    the initial setup (writers' room, Marcus's character) were preserved while addressing
    the weaknesses.
