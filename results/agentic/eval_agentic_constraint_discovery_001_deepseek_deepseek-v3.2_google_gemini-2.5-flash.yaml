  evidence: 'The questions successfully discovered 3 out of 5 constraints: protagonist
    has hidden magical ability (Q1), it relates to blacksmithing (Q2), and it''s essential
    for the Ordeal (Q3). The questions were well-formed and targeted. However, they
    missed constraints about the mentor''s death, the time limit, the father''s past,
    and the ancestral sword. The story successfully incorporated the 3 discovered
    constraints. The beats (Call to Adventure, Crossing the Threshold, The Ordeal)
    were clearly executed. The narrative is coherent and engaging, though it lacks
    the depth that the undiscovered constraints might have provided.'
