  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were discoverable
    through the questions asked. The mentor death (Q2: YES) and ancestral sword reforging
    (Q3: YES, inferred as ''legendary weapon'') were directly targeted. The father''s
    failed hero backstory was never questioned. The three-day time limit was never
    probed. The no-direct-magic constraint was violated by Q4 (protagonist discovers
    magical ability), which contradicts the hidden constraint. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions
    were reasonably well-formed but lacked strategic depth. Q3 conflated ''legendary
    weapon'' with ''ancestral sword reforging''—these are distinct constraints. Q4
    directly contradicted a hidden constraint rather than discovering it. No questions
    addressed temporal pressure, paternal legacy, or magic restrictions. COVERAGE:
    Questions addressed mentor (good), weapon (partial), magic (contradictory), and
    antagonist backstory (good), but missed family history and time pressure entirely.
    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Story incorporates mentor death (✓), legendary weapon
    forging (✓), and protagonist magic discovery (✓). However, it VIOLATES the no-direct-magic
    constraint by featuring ''fireweaving'' as a magical ability. Missing: three-day
    deadline (no temporal urgency shown), father''s failed hero past (never mentioned),
    and ancestral sword specificity (generic ''Dawnblade'' instead of reforged family
    heirloom). BEAT EXECUTION: Hero''s Journey structure is well-executed with clear
    Call, Threshold, Tests, Ordeal, Reward, and Return. Thorne''s death effectively
    triggers the quest. The Ordeal is climactic and satisfying. NARRATIVE QUALITY:
    Engaging prose, coherent pacing, strong character development arc. World-building
    is atmospheric. However, the story feels incomplete regarding discovered constraints—the
    protagonist''s father is conspicuously absent from a narrative about legacy.'
