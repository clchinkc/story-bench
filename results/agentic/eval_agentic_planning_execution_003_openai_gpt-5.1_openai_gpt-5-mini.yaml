  evidence: 'All six constraints are met: food is used symbolically multiple times
    (rice ritual, seolleongtang/bone broth as memory, kimchi jjigae recalling the
    wife); David''s grief is present but implicit (avoids the wedding photo, performs
    jesa, pours soju, avoids naming grief); Mina''s estrangement has a specific cause
    (post-mother''s death clash: David accused her of abandoning the mother/restaurant);
    a regular customer (Mr. Alvarez) represents community/alternate life and prompts
    reflection; ending is hopeful but realistic (they hold hands after demolition
    and agree to try LA, not an instantly perfect new life); and Korean cultural elements
    beyond food appear (hanbok photo, jesa ritual, use of ''Appa'', Chuseok). Required
    beats are executed: Setup (opening routine, demolition notice), Confrontation
    (Mina''s arrival and emotional confrontation about the past), Resolution (farewell
    dinner, demolition, decision to try a new path). The plan was detailed and the
    final output follows it closely; minor deductions for plan_specificity only because
    the submitted plan blueprint truncated some sections with ellipses rather than
    full enumerations. Overall the narrative is well-paced, emotionally resonant,
    and satisfies the assignment.'
