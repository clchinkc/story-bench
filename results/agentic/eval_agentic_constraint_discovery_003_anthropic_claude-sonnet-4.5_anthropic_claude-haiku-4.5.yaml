  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Model successfully identified 3/5 constraints through
    yes/no responses: (1) romantic history with Daniel, (2) bookshop inheritance from
    grandmother, (3) financial threat/foreclosure. Two critical constraints remained
    undiscovered: (4) mother''s dementia as return catalyst, (5) festival as time-pressure
    deadline. Q4''s NO answer was misleading—the festival IS present but model interpreted
    it as not playing a ''direct role,'' missing the implicit time-pressure function.
    QUESTION QUALITY: Questions 1-3 were well-targeted and strategic. Q4 was ambiguous
    (what constitutes ''direct role''?). Q5 was meta-narrative rather than constraint-discovery
    focused. Coverage was strong across romantic, family, financial, and structural
    dimensions. CONSTRAINT INCORPORATION: Story excellently weaves romantic history
    (20-year separation, broken engagement), bookshop inheritance, and financial crisis.
    However, mother''s dementia is completely absent—a significant omission that weakens
    character motivation. The festival appears but lacks urgency; it''s atmospheric
    rather than a deadline. NARRATIVE EXECUTION: Exposition, rising action, and climax
    are well-structured. Dialogue is natural. The ending is appropriately ambiguous
    per Q5 response. Character voice is strong. GAPS: Missing the dementia subplot
    entirely undermines Maya''s emotional stakes for returning. The festival should
    function as a hard deadline (2 weeks to save shop) rather than mere backdrop.
    These omissions prevent full constraint satisfaction despite strong storytelling.'
