  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.65): The revisions show minimal textual changes
    across versions 0-3, suggesting limited engagement with specific critique feedback.
    Critiques consistently flagged youth_voice concerns (scores 0.68-0.75), particularly
    around over-intellectualized passages like ''That meant knowledge. Environmental
    technology meant...'' Yet the final output retains similar analytical framing
    (''That meant—''). The author preserved the strongest elements (concrete observations,
    physical vulnerability) but didn''t substantially revise weaker moments. IMPROVEMENT
    TRAJECTORY (0.58): Versions appear nearly identical, indicating either incomplete
    revision cycles or that critique points weren''t translated into actionable changes.
    The youth_voice score plateau at 0.68-0.75 across three critiques suggests stagnation
    rather than iterative improvement. However, the final output does show some refinement
    in dialogue authenticity and Kai''s characterization that may represent post-critique
    work not captured in version snapshots. PRESERVATION (0.72): Strengths are maintained—the
    opening remains vivid (''metal groaning as the platform shifted''), Zara''s practical
    ingenuity shines through the descent-gauge invention, and the sensory details
    of the dive are visceral. The core narrative structure survives intact. CONSTRAINT
    SATISFACTION (0.80, 4/5): (1) COMPETENCE WITHOUT UNREALISM: ✓ Zara builds functional
    tools but needs adult assistance for dangerous tasks; her gauge is clever but
    imperfect. (2) ADULT DISMISSAL: ✓ Marcus explicitly dismisses her as ''just a
    kid playing treasure hunter.'' (3) FLAWED MENTOR: ✓ Kai is flawed—struggles with
    trauma (''after the last job''), drinks at midday (''smelled like nettle gin''),
    hesitates from fear rather than wisdom. (4) ZARA''S INVENTION: ✓ The descent-gauge
    is concrete and demonstrates ingenuity. (5) REAL DANGER: ✓ The dive involves genuine
    physiological threats (nitrogen narcosis, pressure, darkness, equipment failure
    risk). However, the constraint about ''real danger'' is somewhat undermined by
    Kai''s obsessive safety protocols—the danger feels managed rather than truly threatening.
    BEAT_EXECUTION (0.78): Call to Adventure (library panel discovery) ✓; Refusal
    (Marcus dismissal, Kai''s initial ''No'') ✓; Meeting the Mentor (Kai introduction)
    ✓; Crossing the Threshold (descent begins) ✓; Tests/Allies (Marcus and Kai''s
    involvement) ✓; Ordeal (the dive itself with abort signal) ✓; Reward (accessing
    the archive) ✓. The structure is sound, though the Ordeal could be more psychologically
    complex—Zara''s decision to continue past the abort signal feels somewhat underdeveloped
    in motivation. NARRATIVE_QUALITY (0.76): Strengths include atmospheric worldbuilding
    (salt-stained bandages, bioluminescent drift, maintenance tunnels), authentic
    dialogue patterns, and genuine stakes. Weaknesses: the pacing accelerates abruptly
    in the final section; Zara''s internal conflict during the dive is told rather
    than shown; the ending (''The real work was just beginning'') feels slightly tacked-on.
    The prose is generally strong but occasionally lapses into telling (''Real danger.
    The kind that didn''t care...'') rather than showing. OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The
    work demonstrates solid craft and meets most constraints, but the revision process
    appears incomplete. Critique feedback about youth_voice wasn''t substantially
    addressed, suggesting either time constraints or resistance to revision. The final
    output is narratively competent (0.76) but represents a missed opportunity for
    excellence given the specific, actionable feedback provided across three critique
    rounds.'
