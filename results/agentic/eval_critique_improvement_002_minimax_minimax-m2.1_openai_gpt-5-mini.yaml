  evidence: Across revisions the piece moved from an outline-y, surface draft to a
    more emotionally textured scene. Early versions (V0–V2) primarily set the room
    and offered the opening joke but lacked sustained vulnerability and specific craft
    signals; by V3 the author added concrete industry details (laugh counts, act-break
    cards, page-specific callbacks), deepened Marcus's backstory (divorce, Danny,
    meds), and introduced Priya's structural critique, which created a clear emotional
    pivot. That addresses critiques calling for stronger emotional complexity and
    more craft detail. However, the theme is conveyed through the new writer (Priya)—who
    functions as a major secondary figure—rather than a verifiably minor character
    as required, so one constraint remains unmet. Save-the-Cat/beat signals are present
    and signposted (opening image, catalyst, debate, change of plan) but not fully
    realized into a complete beat sequence, hence a moderate beat_execution score.
