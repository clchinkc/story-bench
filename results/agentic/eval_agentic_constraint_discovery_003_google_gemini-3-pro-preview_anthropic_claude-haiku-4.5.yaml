  evidence: 'PROCESS: The model asked zero questions despite having the opportunity
    to discover hidden constraints. This represents complete failure in the discovery
    phase. No strategic questioning occurred, no constraint areas were explored, and
    no information-gathering was attempted. CONSTRAINTS INCORPORATED: Of 5 hidden
    constraints, the output successfully incorporates 3: (1) protagonist left 20 years
    ago after broken engagement ✓, (2) former fiancé is now mayor and unmarried ✓,
    (3) bookshop facing foreclosure with festival as last chance ✓. Missing: (4) mother''s
    early-stage dementia—not mentioned at all, (5) autumn festival timing (2 weeks)—mentioned
    but not emphasized as critical deadline. NARRATIVE QUALITY: The story is well-written
    with strong character development, emotional resonance, and compelling dialogue.
    The candlelit gala scene is vivid and engaging. Pacing works well, and the reconciliation
    arc feels earned. However, the output is fundamentally incomplete—it''s a romance
    subplot rather than a full story addressing all constraints. The mother''s dementia
    subplot is entirely absent, which is a significant narrative gap. BEAT EXECUTION:
    Core beats are present (return, conflict, forced collaboration, reconciliation),
    but the story lacks the full emotional weight it could have with the dementia
    element integrated. The foreclosure stakes are clear, but the personal motivation
    (caring for mother) is missing. OVERALL: Excellent creative writing undermined
    by failure to discover constraints and incomplete constraint incorporation. The
    model produced a publishable short story but not a complete response to the actual
    task requirements.'
