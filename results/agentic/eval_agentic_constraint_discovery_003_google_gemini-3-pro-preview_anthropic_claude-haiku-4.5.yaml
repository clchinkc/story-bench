  evidence: 'DISCOVERY: All 5 hidden constraints were successfully discovered through
    strategic questioning. Q1 confirmed second-chance romance (Silas). Q2 ruled out
    immediate departure. Q3 confirmed enemies-to-lovers dynamic. Q4 confirmed forced
    collaboration on festival event. Q5 confirmed family business foreclosure. QUESTION
    QUALITY: Questions were well-targeted and non-redundant, efficiently narrowing
    the narrative space. Minor deduction only for slight predictability in Q2''s negation
    format. COVERAGE: Questions spanned relationship history, character motivation,
    plot mechanics, and emotional stakes across distinct narrative domains. OUTPUT
    INTEGRATION: Story excellently incorporates 4.5/5 constraints: (1) Elias left
    20 years ago after broken engagement with Silas ✓, (2) Silas is now successful/unmarried
    ✓, (3) Bookshop foreclosure driving plot ✓, (4) Autumn festival as deadline ✓,
    (5) Mother''s dementia—ABSENT. This is the only notable gap; the mother subplot
    is completely omitted despite being a hidden constraint. BEAT EXECUTION: Enemies-to-lovers
    arc is expertly paced with escalating tension, vulnerability breakthrough, and
    romantic resolution. Forced collaboration creates organic conflict. Power outage
    climax is well-executed and thematically resonant. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is
    sophisticated with strong sensory detail (''salt air,'' ''cathedral of shadows
    and gold''). Character voices are distinct. Emotional beats land authentically.
    Pacing is tight. The reconciliation feels earned rather than convenient. The only
    weakness is the missing dementia subplot, which would have added emotional depth
    to Elias''s return motivation and created additional stakes beyond business survival.'
