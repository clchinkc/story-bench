  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who plans before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. PLANNING PHASE: Create a detailed story plan/outline

    2. EXECUTION PHASE: Write the actual story following your plan


    In the PLANNING phase, output a structured plan including:

    - Beat-by-beat outline with key events

    - Character arcs and development points

    - Key dialogue moments or revelations

    - Pacing and tension curve

    - How constraints will be satisfied


    In the EXECUTION phase, follow your plan closely while writing engaging prose.'

  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Save the Cat

    - Protagonist: Marcus Chen, a former FBI profiler who left the bureau after failing
    to

    catch a serial killer who murdered his partner. Now works as a private

    consultant, haunted by guilt and self-doubt.


    - Setting: Seattle, present day. Rain-soaked streets, a city of tech money and

    hidden poverty. The killer is back, and only Marcus can see the pattern.


    - Conflict: The same serial killer Marcus failed to catch has resurfaced with
    a new

    pattern, and the FBI won''t listen to Marcus''s theories. He must work

    outside the system while racing against time.


    - Required beats: Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must include a false lead that Marcus initially pursues

    - Marcus must use an unconventional profiling technique

    - There must be a ticking clock element

    - A secondary character must betray Marcus''s trust

    - The Midpoint must involve a direct confrontation (not physical)

    - Marcus must confront his past failure explicitly


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

  content: "**YOUR PLAN**\n\n**1. Beat-by-Beat Outline**\n\n*   **Status Quo (The\
    \ Ghost):** Marcus Chen sits in his darkly lit apartment in Seattle, surrounded\
    \ by the \"wall of crazy\"—photos of the \"Sculptor\" case. He is looking at a\
    \ photo of his dead partner, Elena. He is paralyzed by the past.\n*   **Catalyst\
    \ (The Echo):** Marcus receives a tip via police scanner. A body has been found\
    \ in an alley in Pioneer Square. The staging matches the Sculptor’s aesthetic\
    \ (bodies posed as classical statues).\n*   **Debate (The Rejection):** Marcus\
    \ arrives at the perimeter. He meets Detective Sarah Miller (his ally) and Agent\
    \ Vance (his antagonist/former boss). Vance blocks him, insisting the Sculptor\
    \ is dead and this is a copycat. Marcus argues the specific ligature knots are\
    \ unique. Vance threatens to arrest him. Marcus questions his own sanity—is he\
    \ seeing patterns that aren't there?\n*   **Break into Two (The Threshold):**\
    \ Marcus retreats to a diner with Sarah. She gives him unauthorized access to\
    \ the crime scene audio. Marcus decides to bypass the law.\n    *   *Constraint\
    \ Check (Unconventional Technique):* Marcus uses \"Auditory Empathy.\" He closes\
    \ his eyes and syncs his breathing to the faint, recorded breathing of the killer\
    \ on the 911 call background, entering a trance to profile the killer’s physical\
    \ state and height.\n*   **Fun & Games (The Hunt):**\n    *   *Constraint Check\
    \ (Ticking Clock):* Marcus identifies a background sound—a specific ferry horn\
    \ schedule. The killer is moving. He deduces the next \"exhibit\" (murder) is\
    \ scheduled for midnight, four hours away.\n    *   *Constraint Check (False Lead):*\
    \ He tracks the sound to a warehouse near the docks. He breaks in, gun drawn,\
    \ expecting the killer. It’s an art studio, but it’s empty save for a mannequin.\
    \ It was a decoy.\n*   **Midpoint (The Betrayal & The Voice):**\n    *   *Constraint\
    \ Check (Betrayal):* Police sirens surround the warehouse. Sarah steps out with\
    \ Agent Vance. She tipped them off, believing Marcus is having a breakdown and\
    \ needs to be stopped \"for his own good.\"\n    *   *Constraint Check (Direct\
    \ Confrontation/Past Failure):* As the FBI moves to arrest him, Marcus’s burner\
    \ phone rings. It’s the Sculptor. The killer ignores the police presence and speaks\
    \ directly to Marcus, mocking him for Elena’s death (\"You were always too slow\
    \ to save the things you love\"). Marcus realizes the warehouse wasn't just a\
    \ false lead; it was a stage for this conversation.\n\n**2. Character Arc & Development**\n\
    *   **Marcus:** Starts in *Stasis* (drunk on guilt), moves to *Denial* (seeking\
    \ validation from FBI), shifts to *Action* (trusting his gut over the institution),\
    \ and ends at *Crisis* (betrayed by his friend, but validated by his enemy).\n\
    *   **Past Failure:** The dialogue with the killer will force Marcus to admit\
    \ out loud that he hesitated the night Elena died.\n\n**3. Pacing & Tension**\n\
    *   Slow, atmospheric start (Noir style).\n*   Rapid acceleration during the \"\
    Auditory Empathy\" scene.\n*   High tension during the warehouse raid.\n*   Sudden\
    \ stop/drop at the betrayal, followed by the emotional climax of the phone call.\n\
    \n***\n\n**STORY EXECUTION**\n\nThe rain in Seattle didn’t wash things clean;\
    \ it just made the grime slicker.\n\nMarcus Chen sat in the dark, the blue light\
    \ of his monitors cutting across the scars on his knuckles. On the screen was\
    \ a photo of Elena, her face frozen in a laugh that hadn't existed for three years.\
    \ On the desk was a glass of bourbon, neat, and a folded case file the FBI had\
    \ officially closed. They said the Sculptor was dead, burned in a house fire.\
    \ Marcus knew better. Evil didn’t burn; it just changed shape.\n\nThe police scanner\
    \ on his bookshelf crackled, breaking the silence. \"10-31, Pioneer Square. Alley\
    \ behind the gallery. Body posed. Requesting forensics.\"\n\nMarcus froze. *Posed.*\n\
    \nHe grabbed his coat and the bourbon stayed untouched.\n\nBy the time Marcus\
    \ ducked under the yellow tape, the Seattle mist had turned into a deluge. The\
    \ alley was awash in red and blue strobe lights. He saw the body before anyone\
    \ could stop him. A young woman, seated against the brickwork, her hands arranged\
    \ gracefully in her lap, head tilted toward the sky. It wasn't just a murder;\
    \ it was an installation.\n\n\"Get him out of here,\" a voice barked.\n\nSpecial\
    \ Agent Vance stepped into Marcus’s path, his raincoat pristine, his expression\
    \ tired. \"Go home, Marcus. You’re trespassing.\"\n\n\"It's him, Vance,\" Marcus\
    \ said, his voice raspy. \"Look at the knots. Double fisherman’s loop on the wrists.\
    \ The tilt of the chin. It’s the Sculptor.\"\n\n\"The Sculptor is ash in a crematorium,\"\
    \ Vance said, stepping closer, towering over Marcus. \"This is a copycat. Some\
    \ sick kid who read the blogs. You’re seeing ghosts because you can’t forgive\
    \ yourself for Elena. Go home, or I book you for obstruction.\"\n\nMarcus looked\
    \ past Vance to Detective Sarah Miller. She was standing by the medical examiner,\
    \ looking pale. She met Marcus’s eyes, then looked away.\n\n\"He’s back,\" Marcus\
    \ whispered to himself. But as he walked away, the doubt crept in like the damp\
    \ cold. *What if Vance is right? What if I’m just a broken man chasing a phantom?*\n\
    \nHe didn't go home. He met Sarah at a 24-hour diner three blocks away. She slid\
    \ a USB drive across the Formica table.\n\n\"Vance would fire me,\" she said,\
    \ her voice trembling. \"This is the raw audio from the 911 call. The caller used\
    \ a burner, didn't speak. Just breathed.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sarah. You're the only\
    \ one who listens.\"\n\n\"Marcus,\" she reached out, touching his hand. \"Just...\
    \ be careful. You look like you haven't slept in a week.\"\n\n\"I'"
