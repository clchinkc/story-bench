  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: The plan outline is well-structured and addresses narrative
    framework comprehensively. The output demonstrates strong atmospheric writing,
    effective character establishment, and clear thematic resonance. The Catalyst
    beat is executed excellently with the discovery of the new murder and Marcus''s
    recognition of the RSK signature. The Opening Image/Setup is vivid and establishes
    Marcus''s isolation, guilt, and obsession convincingly. CRITICAL GAPS: (1) FALSE
    LEAD - Plan mentions it will be included but output contains NO false lead; Marcus
    immediately recognizes the true signature without pursuing a misleading theory.
    (2) UNCONVENTIONAL PROFILING TECHNIQUE - Not demonstrated in output; no unique
    methodology shown. (3) TICKING CLOCK - Absent; no time pressure or deadline established.
    (4) SECONDARY CHARACTER BETRAYAL - Not present; Lena is mentioned but no betrayal
    occurs or is set up. (5) MIDPOINT CONFRONTATION - Not reached in output; story
    ends at Catalyst. (6) PAST FAILURE CONFRONTATION - Alluded to thematically but
    not explicitly confronted. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening Image/Setup (strong), Catalyst
    (strong), Debate (missing), Break into Two (missing), Midpoint (missing). The
    output is essentially a prologue that establishes the inciting incident but doesn''t
    progress into the story proper. While the writing quality is high and atmospheric,
    the execution is incomplete relative to requirements. The plan promised these
    elements but the output only delivers the opening act.'
