  evidence: The initial versions were identical, indicating no iterative changes until
    the final output. The final output, however, shows significant development and
    addresses most constraints. The 'competence before flaw' is well-established.
    The friendship feels genuine and earned through shared vulnerability. Elena's
    transformation is internal, focusing on her internal conflict and decision-making.
    The medical detail (18-gauge into basilic vein, capnography) is specific and serves
    the story. The ending is ambiguous. The only constraint not fully met is the 'friendship
    must feel genuine and earned' as it feels a bit rushed into deep vulnerability,
    though the 'stolen twenty minutes' helps. The narrative quality is good, with
    a clear arc and character development.
