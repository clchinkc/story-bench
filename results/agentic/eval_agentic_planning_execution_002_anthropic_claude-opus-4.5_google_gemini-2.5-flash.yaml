  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing character
    behaviors, signal characteristics, and specific interactions for each beat. The
    final output adheres perfectly to the plan. All constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation
    is shown through specific behaviors (cold rice, unread messages, dead plant, no
    photos, talking to herself, empty lecture hall, retreating to quarters, not seeing
    humans for 40 hours); the alien signal is genuinely alien (gravitational fluctuations,
    spacetime distortions, evolving pattern, loops, grief crystallized into mathematics,
    gaps as empathy); Samuel Okonkwo challenges Yuki''s approach; Marcus is an unconventional
    mentor (maintenance engineer, jazz musician, talks about listening to pipes and
    wife); the threshold is psychological (understanding empathy through Emi''s grief
    and applying it to the signal); and the moment of human connection is Yuki placing
    her hand on Emi''s shoulder, surprising Yuki and leading to her breakthrough.
    The narrative quality is very high, with strong characterization, good pacing,
    and a compelling emotional arc.'
