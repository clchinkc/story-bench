  evidence: 'Plan completeness/specificity: The planning phase explicitly includes
    the false lead (Calvin Zhou), the unconventional pluviometric/synesthetic profiling,
    betrayal foreshadowed (Owen), and a timed storm/clock element; the outline is
    concrete with named locations and scenes. Minor blemish: the plan text is slightly
    truncated in one spot but intent is clear. Plan adherence: The final output closely
    follows the plan—opening image, Catalyst (Hanged Man and Janus link), Debate (Marcus''
    PTSD and initial false-lead chase), Break into Two (Baxter dismisses him; he goes
    rogue with Park and Owen), and Midpoint (shipyard phone/stream confrontation with
    Janus and the countdown) all appear. Constraint satisfaction: All six constraints
    are satisfied in the final output—false lead (Calvin Zhou), unconventional profiling
    (pluviometric/synesthesia), ticking clock (Janus'' countdown), betrayal (Owen
    livestreams/tips vans), Midpoint confrontation is verbal/direct (Janus hijacks
    stream/phone), and Marcus explicitly confronts his past failure (admits waiting
    47 minutes and vows not to repeat it). Beat execution: Catalyst, Debate, Break
    into Two, Midpoint are present and functional. Narrative quality: Strong imagery,
    tension, and pacing; the ticking clock and betrayal raise stakes effectively.
    Small weaknesses: a couple of planned beats (e.g., widow visit) were elided in
    the final prose, and a physical grab occurs alongside the Midpoint confrontation
    (which could blur the ''non-physical'' requirement if interpreted narrowly), but
    the required direct verbal confrontation is still present. Overall—very good execution
    with minor omissions.'
