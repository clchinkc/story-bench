  evidence: "The plan is mostly complete, covering all beats and constraints, though\
    \ the 'Korean cultural element' is only vaguely mentioned as 'banchan' and 'kimchi'\
    \ which are also food. The plan is specific enough to guide the writing. The final\
    \ output adheres well to the plan for Act 1. \n\nConstraint Satisfaction: \n1.\
    \ Food used symbolically twice: Yes, 'kimchi and banchan' representing stability/heritage,\
    \ and 'each dish was a cornerstone of his identity'. (2/2)\n2. David's grief present\
    \ but not explicit: Yes, 'He didn't reach for it, just held the image in his mind,\
    \ a silent acknowledgment of the void she’d left. This restaurant, their restaurant,\
    \ was her enduring presence.' (1/1)\n3. Daughter's estrangement believable cause:\
    \ Yes, 'He'd missed her college graduation, convinced himself the restaurant needed\
    \ him more, and in doing so, pushed her further away.' (1/1)\n4. Regular customer\
    \ represents something: Yes, Mr. Henderson represents the 'loyal community, the\
    \ old neighborhood'. (1/1)\n5. Ending hopeful but not unrealistically happy: This\
    \ is Act 1, so not applicable yet. (N/A)\n6. At least one Korean cultural element\
    \ beyond food: This is the weakest point. While 'banchan', 'kimchi-jjim', 'kkakdugi',\
    \ and 'barley tea' are mentioned, they are all food items. The plan mentioned\
    \ 'banchan' and 'kimchi' as the cultural element, which is food. The output doesn't\
    \ introduce a non-food cultural element. (0/1)\n\nBeat Execution: \n1. Setup (Act\
    \ 1): Fully executed, introducing David, the restaurant, the demolition, his grief,\
    \ Mr. Henderson, and Mia's call. (1/1)\n2. Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint): The\
    \ call with Mia serves as a confrontation, but it's placed at the end of Act 1,\
    \ not the Act 2 midpoint. The plan only outlined Act 1. (0/1)\n3. Resolution (Act\
    \ 3): Not applicable as only Act 1 was written. (N/A)\n\nNarrative Quality: The\
    \ writing is strong, evocative, and establishes the character and conflict well.\
    \ The pacing is good for an opening act. The dialogue feels natural. The implicit\
    \ grief is handled skillfully."
