  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing character
    traits, isolation behaviors, and the nature of the alien signal and mentor. The
    final output adheres perfectly to the plan. All constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation
    is shown through specific behaviors (haptic gloves, scheduling socialization,
    swiping away invites), the alien signal is genuinely alien (gravity fluctuation,
    4D cubes, synesthetic flood, loneliness creating gravity), Elias challenges Yuki''s
    approach (''Stop looking for grammar... Start looking for a payload''), Silas
    is an unconventional mentor (blind synesthetic composer, ''sees'' sound, teaches
    feeling), the threshold is psychological (removing gloves, opening mind to empathy),
    and the moment of human connection is surprising (Yuki grabbing Elias''s hand,
    his empathetic response). All beats are executed: Call to Adventure (Halloway''s
    arrival, the signal), Refusal of the Call (Yuki''s insistence on theory, ''cosmic
    phenomenon''), Meeting the Mentor (Silas''s introduction and advice), Crossing
    the Threshold (removing gloves, entering tank, experiencing signal). The narrative
    quality is very high, with strong pacing, tension, and evocative language. The
    ending is particularly impactful.'
