  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 6 constraints executed flawlessly. (1) False lead: Dr.
    Thorne is a sophisticated misdirection—Marcus pursues him for 20 hours before
    revelation. (2) Unconventional profiling: Sensory Mimicry is creative and well-integrated,
    showing Marcus aligning heartbeat/senses to killer''s psychology. (3) Ticking
    clock: 48-hour cycle established in Debate, compressed to 12 hours at climax—creates
    escalating urgency. (4) Secondary betrayal: Elias''s betrayal is emotionally earned;
    his motivation (concern for Marcus''s mental health) makes it complex rather than
    arbitrary. (5) Midpoint confrontation: Museum warehouse scene is non-physical
    verbal/psychological confrontation via phone—killer reveals knowledge of Pete''s
    death, forcing Marcus to confront his failure directly. (6) Past failure: Marcus
    explicitly admits ''You chose the wrong door, Marcus. You let him die in the dark''—this
    is direct, visceral confrontation with his trauma. All 4 Save the Cat beats present:
    Catalyst (body at museum), Debate (SAC Miller rejection + self-doubt), Break into
    Two (decision to go rogue, stealing data), Midpoint (phone confrontation revealing
    false lead + betrayal). MINOR WEAKNESSES: Plan mentions ''B-Story'' and ''Fun
    and Games'' sections but execution compresses these slightly—Elias relationship
    could have one more scene to deepen betrayal impact. The transition from Thorne
    confrontation to phone call is slightly abrupt, though narratively justified.
    Sensory Mimicry scene, while creative, could benefit from slightly more sensory
    detail to fully justify its ''unconventional'' label. PACING: Excellent. Rain
    motif bookends opening and climax. Dialogue is sharp. Reveals are staggered effectively.
    The final image (Marcus vanishing into Seattle night) provides strong momentum
    into Act 3.'
