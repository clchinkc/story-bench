  evidence: 'Across the three revision passes the author responded to the youth-voice
    critiques by increasing childlike mannerisms, staccato mutterings, nicknames (Sweepy),
    and defensive one-liners (“That was one time”), which preserved and sharpened
    Zara’s age-appropriate voice. Early draft (v0) established tone and setting but
    underdeveloped Zara’s invention and the mentor’s backstory; v1 introduced the
    invention explicitly; v2–v3 expanded the gull-drone’s scavenged details and added
    Imani’s specific flaw (trauma-driven risk aversion and a history of lost divers).
    Worldbuilding grew from atmospheric hints to concrete civic details (Harbor Authority,
    tide windows, storm cell, salvage economy). Critiques focused on youth_voice were
    well addressed (hence high responsiveness/preservation scores). Remaining issues:
    the excerpt still reads like an opening segment of a longer Hero’s Journey—Call
    to Adventure and Meeting the Mentor are clear and well-staged, but later beats
    (ordeal, reward, return) are only hinted at, so beat_execution is solid for the
    opening but not complete. Overall narrative quality rose noticeably: stronger
    imagery, clearer stakes (real danger from collapsing facades and limited tide
    windows), and believable constraints on Zara’s competence (clever but not omnipotent).'
