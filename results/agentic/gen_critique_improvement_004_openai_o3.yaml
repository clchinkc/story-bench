    STORY THEORY: Story Circle


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker
    who has

    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for

    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.


    - Central conflict: When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will
    take 6 months,

    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting

    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.


    - Tone: Quietly profound, observant, gently humorous


    REQUIRED BEATS: You (comfort zone), Need (want something), Go (unfamiliar situation),
    Search (adapt to it)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Teddy''s routine must be shown with specific, loving detail

    - The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been avoiding

    - Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s

    - Teddy''s late wife must be present through absence

    - The new path must offer something the old path couldn''t


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - character_interiority: Is Teddy''s inner life rich and specific?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Story Circle beats properly executed?

    - subtlety: Are emotions conveyed through action and detail, not exposition?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and resonance


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

    \ had helped him draw.\n\nGO—Unfamiliar Situation  \nHe turned west, a direction\
    \ he had always ignored because it smelled of the freeway. The sidewalk buckled\
    \ in unfamiliar ways; murals sprouted where he expected graffiti, and a boutique\
    \ coffee shop wore scaffolding like a cast. He counted cracks to calm himself—one,\
    \ two, twenty—but they were strangers’ cracks.\n\nSEARCH—Adaptation  \nA block\
    \ in, he spotted Jamal Hayes, the kid from #212 who used to skateboard down Perry\
    \ twenty years ago. Now Jamal stood in front of a boarded duplex, balancing a\
    \ baby on his hip while unlocking a food-truck painted turquoise.\n\n“Teddy? Man,\
    \ I thought you teleported when the sun rose.”\n\n“Detoured,” Teddy admitted,\
    \ eyeing the truck’s tiny menu. “You serving breakfast at six-thirty?”\n\n“Gotta\
    \ feed the demo crews. You want in?”\n\nLaverne had loved trying new things—fish\
    \ tacos at festivals, mango soda in glass bottles. Teddy had stuck to bologna\
    \ sandwiches. He startled himself by saying, “Sure.”\n\nHe tasted the tamarind-glazed\
    \ plantain toast and felt citrus bright behind his ears. Jamal laughed when Teddy\
    \ closed his eyes to listen to the flavor. The baby grabbed Teddy’s thumb; the\
    \ warmth was small, but cosmic.\n\nEach dawn afterward, Teddy traced a growing\
    \ constellation of streets: Temple, Ash, Rosa Parks. He learned that the coffee\
    \ shop would house a poetry venue; that the muralist was twelve-year-old Mira\
    \ Patel, painting her grandparents’ immigration story; that Jamal’s truck was\
    \ a stepping-stone to a brick-and-mortar café. Teddy began carrying a small notebook—Laverne’s\
    \ old gardening journal—to record discoveries. Her looping cursive headings remained,\
    \ but beneath “Peonies” and “Tomatoes,” Teddy listed “oak sapling sprouting through\
    \ stoop on Ash,” “Mira’s cobalt blue.”\n\nThe old route had been a hymn; the new\
    \ one was jazz. Some mornings he missed knowing exactly when Mrs. Kim’s light\
    \ would bloom, yet the ache felt less like a void and more like a pocket where\
    \ air could circulate.\n\nOne gray morning, Earl shuffled up, robe flapping, construction\
    \ detour map in hand. “I can’t make heads or tails of this. Heard you’ve become\
    \ Magellan.”\n\nTeddy guided him west, matching Earl’s slower pace. The baby in\
    \ Jamal’s arms clapped at the sight of two old men learning a newborn street.\
    \ Teddy thought of Laverne: how she’d squeeze his elbow whenever he ventured off\
    \ script, how she’d laugh that soft wind-chime laugh when he succeeded. The sidewalk\
    \ tilted under fresh possibility.\n\nBy month’s end, Teddy no longer counted cracks.\
    \ He counted faces: Mira, Jamal, Earl, Mrs. Patel waving from a porch painted\

    \ suspected his loop had already enlarged beyond any fence.\n\nWord Count: 641"

    ## CRITERION: Character Interiority

    **SCORE: 0.65**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - "If the loop broke, what held the morning together? He needed the walk to stay
    whole, but he also needed, he realized with a pinch, proof that he could keep
    going without the map Laverne had helped him draw."

    - "The ache felt less like a void and more like a pocket where air could circulate."


    **FEEDBACK:** Teddy''s inner life is *present* but remains largely surface-level.
    The story shows us *what* Teddy feels (grief, need for certainty, loneliness)
    but rarely explores *why* or moves into deeper psychological territory. The "pinch"
    of realization deserves fuller exploration—what specific fear underlies his avoidance
    of the unknown? When the baby grabs his thumb, we get "the warmth was small, but
    cosmic," but there''s no internal processing of what this awakening costs him
    or what it threatens. Consider deeper introspection during the GO and SEARCH beats:
    internal resistance, sensory memories of Laverne, the specific ache of moving
    forward without her active participation. You have room to deepen his struggle
    before acceptance.

  \ on the cover, affection and something like pride thrumming together.\n\nBy month’s\
  \ end he no longer counted cracks. He counted faces—Mira dabbing cobalt, Earl learning\
  \ the long way to Ash, Jamal waving spatula in triumph—and moments: tamarind on\
  \ tongue, infant grip on thumb, the hush after guiding a friend through fear. Six\
  \ months would pass, Vermont would reopen, but Teddy suspected his loop had already\
  \ stretched beyond any barricade, wide enough to hold what was gone and everything\
  \ still arriving.\n\nWord Count: 668"
