  evidence: The quality did not improve across revisions. All revisions were identical
    to the initial version, only adding a few words at the end of the sentence. This
    indicates no actual revision process took place. The final output is a complete
    story, but the iterative revisions provided were not actual revisions of the story's
    content or structure.
