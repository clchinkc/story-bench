  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece clearly improves: V0 establishes atmosphere
    but is visually framed and brief; V1 introduces tactile tech (refreshable Braille
    display) and shifts emphasis to non-visual cues; V2 deepens the server-hum and
    tactile imagery; V3/final sharpens sensory language (fermenting citrus, churro
    grease), adds mechanical detail (pins snapping up and down), and crucially introduces
    and repeats the audio clue "click-scrape" both in the recording and in the real-world
    chase. Good elements—Imani''s audio expertise, the soundproofed closet, the podcast
    framing—are preserved and amplified. The bodega scene functions as an entertaining
    ''Fun and Games'' with clever audio-based sleuthing before the mood turns dark
    when the same audio clue returns in person. Detective Miller initially underestimates
    Imani, satisfying that constraint. Minor deductions from perfect scores reflect
    small rough edges in pacing and a couple of slightly on-the-nose phrasings, but
    overall the final version meets the brief strongly.'
