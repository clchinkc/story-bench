  evidence: 'Version 1 established strong tactile and auditory grounding (humidity
    as a ''wet wool blanket'', headphones, ''world screaming'') but was fragmentary.
    By Version 3 the piece preserved those strengths and added richer non-visual detail
    (smell of hot asphalt and bakery yeast, foam-padded walls, sweat), a concrete
    framing device (''Episode fifty''), and a clear demonstration of Imani''s expertise
    (screen reader speed, waveform fluency). The final output builds further: a specific
    audio clue (''click-drag'' scraping, loose ball bearing in a fidget spinner) that
    becomes crucial, a named skeptic (Detective Miller) who initially underestimates
    Imani, and an explicit ''Fun and Games'' sequence where she playfully isolates
    layers of sound—entertaining before tension rises. Minor issues: the final excerpt
    is slightly truncated (ends on ''Miller''), and the darker turn is implied rather
    than fully played out in the provided text. Overall, each revision increases specificity,
    sensory richness, and narrative focus while keeping the strongest earlier elements.'
