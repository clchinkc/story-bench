  evidence: The initial versions were very short and only covered the opening image.
    The revisions progressively added more content, expanding on the character, setting,
    and introducing the plot beats. The final version successfully incorporates all
    the required elements and constraints. The expansion from V0 to V1 added more
    sensory details. V2 and V3 were identical to V1, indicating a pause in revision,
    but the final output shows significant expansion beyond V3, addressing the full
    prompt. The core elements from the initial versions (Imani's world of sound, the
    specific sounds) were well-preserved and built upon.
