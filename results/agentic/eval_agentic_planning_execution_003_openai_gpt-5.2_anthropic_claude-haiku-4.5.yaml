  evidence: 'PLAN QUALITY: The plan is exceptionally detailed with clear character
    arcs, specific motivations, and concrete narrative beats. It addresses all constraints
    explicitly and provides concrete examples (second tea cup, estrangement cause,
    Stan''s role). The three-act structure is clearly mapped with dramatic question
    and turning points identified.


    PLAN ADHERENCE: The final output follows the plan closely. All major plot points
    execute as planned: David''s grief-through-routine, Mina''s arrival, the confrontation
    about abandonment, the kimchi jar as symbolic bridge, the pop-up resolution. Minor
    deviation: the incense scene (not in plan) adds depth but doesn''t contradict
    plan.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5.5/6):

    1. FOOD SYMBOLIC (✓ FULL): Kimchi jar represents fermentation/time/change; peppermint
    jar represents wife''s presence; final meal represents community. Two+ uses clearly
    achieved.

    2. GRIEF PRESENT NOT STATED (✓ FULL): Masterfully executed through empty chair,
    second cup, apron hook, incense ritual. Grief is palpable but never named directly.

    3. ESTRANGEMENT CAUSE SPECIFIC (✓ FULL): David demanded she stay for restaurant/mother''s
    legacy; Mina heard rejection of her autonomy. Believable generational/immigrant
    family conflict.

    4. REGULAR CUSTOMER REPRESENTS (✓ FULL): Stan embodies neighborhood memory, immigrant-to-immigrant
    solidarity, and truth-telling function. His presence validates David''s impact.

    5. KOREAN CULTURAL ELEMENT (✓ PARTIAL): Incense ritual, bowing, doenjang jjigae,
    banchan, japchae, mandu, barley tea present. However, these are primarily food-related.
    The incense ritual is the strongest non-food element, but more explicit cultural
    depth (e.g., specific holiday reference, deeper spiritual practice) would strengthen
    this.

    6. ENDING HOPEFUL NOT UNREALISTIC (✓ FULL): Pop-up plan is modest, achievable,
    and leaves uncertainty. David won''t disappear; relationship rebuilds gradually.
    No false resolution.


    BEAT EXECUTION (3/3):

    - ACT 1 SETUP: Demolition notice, David''s routine, grief markers, Stan''s arrival
    establish stakes and character.

    - ACT 2 CONFRONTATION: Mina''s arrival, direct argument about abandonment, David''s
    defensiveness, emotional impasse at midpoint.

    - ACT 3 RESOLUTION: Kimchi jar gesture, pop-up plan, David''s commitment to visit,
    final walk away with arm-in-arm connection.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is lyrical and precise. Sensory details (steam, incense
    smoke, paint markings) ground emotion. Pacing balances quiet moments with confrontation.
    Dialogue feels authentic to immigrant family dynamics. Ending achieves bittersweet
    hope—not redemption, but possibility. The final image (air remembering garlic
    and sesame) is particularly strong.


    WEAKNESSES: Korean cultural element relies heavily on food/language markers rather
    than deeper spiritual or cultural practice. The pop-up resolution, while realistic,
    is somewhat modest—could benefit from slightly more specificity about what this
    means long-term. Minor: Mina''s character could have one more scene showing her
    agency/growth beyond responding to David.


    OVERALL: Exceptional execution of a complex brief. Plan was thorough and specific;
    output honors it while adding literary depth. All hard constraints met; one soft
    constraint (cultural depth) partially satisfied.'
