  evidence: The critiques consistently highlighted the strong satisfaction of constraints,
    particularly Sarah's methodical nature and the decision ending. The revisions,
    though minor, refined the prose and strengthened the narrative purpose of the
    fog and the hint of Sarah's past. The core strengths identified in the initial
    critiques were maintained and enhanced, leading to a very strong final output.
