  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Exceptional plan with concrete behavioral details (5:47 AM
    wake time, service elevator, delivery drone avoidance). Isolation shown through
    specific actions rather than exposition—the cardboard box shelter memory, the
    unopened mail, the noise-canceling headphones. Emil is genuinely unconventional
    as mentor (elderly, housebound, uses personal story about grandmother''s cipher
    rather than direct advice). The human connection moment (hand on shoulder, Emil''s
    unexpected presence) surprises Yuki authentically. Signal described as genuinely
    alien (17-note scale, indifferent mathematics, not anthropomorphic). Output follows
    plan closely with strong narrative voice and pacing. GAPS: (1) Colleague who challenges
    Yuki''s approach is completely absent—this is a significant constraint violation.
    The plan mentions this requirement but execution includes only Emil (mentor) and
    project coordinator (unnamed). No peer challenge to her methodology or approach.
    (2) Threshold crossing is psychological but somewhat underdeveloped—the final
    line about ''descent into something deeper'' is metaphorical rather than a clear
    psychological crossing moment. The acceptance of the project feels like agreement
    rather than true threshold crossing. (3) ''Refusal of the Call'' beat is implicit
    but weak—Yuki''s initial hesitation (''I don''t think I''m the right person'')
    is quickly overridden by Emil rather than being a genuine refusal she must overcome.
    EXECUTION QUALITY: Prose is sophisticated with excellent sensory detail. Pacing
    builds effectively. Character voice is distinct. The thematic irony (studying
    aliens while avoiding humans) is well-integrated. However, the missing colleague
    constraint and underdeveloped refusal/threshold beats prevent higher scores.'
