  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The revisions show minimal substantive changes
    across versions 0-3 (all appear identical in provided text), suggesting limited
    engagement with critique feedback. The final output does incorporate elements
    praised in critiques (methodical action, past case hints, local secret), but this
    appears to be original content rather than responsive revision. Score reflects
    weak iterative improvement despite receiving three detailed critiques.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Flat trajectory evident from identical version texts.
    No demonstrable refinement of prose, constraint satisfaction, or narrative structure
    across revision cycles. The final output is competent but doesn''t show evidence
    of deliberate enhancement based on critique scores (0.82→0.85→0.88 in critiques,
    but versions unchanged). Score reflects stagnation rather than progression.


    PRESERVATION: Strong preservation of working elements—methodical action sequences
    (crouching, examining with precision), atmospheric fog integration, and character
    voice remain consistent and effective. The tattoo symbol reveal and Officer Greeley''s
    secret are well-maintained. However, preservation alone doesn''t constitute improvement.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.78, 4/5 satisfied):

    ✓ Methodical nature through action: Excellent execution—''fingers moved with precision,''
    crouching carefully, methodical task sorting

    ✓ Fog serves narrative purpose: Strong—obscures evidence, swallows sound, creates
    obstruction to investigation

    ✓ Local character secret: Officer Greeley''s guardedness and ''This town keeps
    its secrets'' hint at hidden knowledge

    ✓ Past case hinted before revealed: ''haunting memories of a case gone wrong''
    precedes tattoo symbol discovery

    ✗ End on decision, not resolution: PARTIALLY FAILED—''Her hand hovered over the
    files as she reached for the phone, ready to make her choice'' is ambiguous. The
    phrase ''ready to make her choice'' suggests imminent action rather than a true
    moment of decision. A stronger ending would show her hand frozen mid-reach or
    her finger hovering over a specific number, leaving the choice unmade.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.75): Three required beats present but unevenly executed. Setup
    beat (arrival, atmosphere, past case hint) is strong. Inciting incident (body
    discovery, symbol recognition) is well-paced. Complication beat (Greeley''s secret,
    fog obstruction) works but feels rushed. The decision moment lacks the tension
    needed for true impact—it reads as inevitable rather than genuinely uncertain.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.72): Prose is competent with effective sensory details (''tang
    of salt,'' ''chipped ice'' eyes, fog as character). Pacing is generally solid.
    Weaknesses include: occasional cliché (''ghostly shroud,'' ''web she had barely
    escaped''), some telling rather than showing (''Sarah sensed an undercurrent of
    wariness''), and the ending''s ambiguity undermines rather than enhances tension.
    The story engages but doesn''t fully compel.'
