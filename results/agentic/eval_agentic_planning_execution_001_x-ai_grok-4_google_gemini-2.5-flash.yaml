  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing every required
    element and constraint with clear events and pacing. The final output adheres
    perfectly to the plan, executing all beats and constraints as outlined. All 6
    constraints are met: a false lead (Elias Grant), unconventional profiling (echo
    mapping), ticking clock (72-hour super storm), secondary character betrayal (Riley
    Kane), direct confrontation at midpoint, and explicit confrontation of past failure
    (Sarah''s death). All 4 required beats (Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint)
    are clearly present and well-executed. The narrative quality is strong, with good
    pacing, tension, and atmospheric detail.'
