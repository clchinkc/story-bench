  evidence: The initial critiques highlighted good character interiority but also
    pointed to areas for deeper emotional resonance. The revisions, particularly the
    final one, significantly deepened Teddy's inner life, especially regarding Lena's
    absence and his avoidance of grief. The specific details of his routine became
    more loving and poignant. The introduction of Delia and Mr. Alvarez in the new
    path effectively wove in the neighbor constraint and showed the new path offering
    something the old couldn't. The disruption clearly revealed Teddy's avoidance
    of grief. The prose quality remained strong throughout and improved in emotional
    depth.
