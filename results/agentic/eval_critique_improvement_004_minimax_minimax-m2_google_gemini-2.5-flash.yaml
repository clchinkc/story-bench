  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on character interiority, specifically
    the filtering of Teddy's thoughts and the need for more specific, less abstract
    internal shifts. The revisions show a clear effort to address this. While early
    versions were very descriptive of his routine, later versions, particularly the
    final output, introduce more direct internal feelings ('his stomach clenched,
    a familiar knot tightening,' 'He felt June’s absence like a stone in his shoe,'
    'the memory a physical blow'). The final version also introduces the idea of June's
    absence shifting from a 'hole' or 'weight' to a 'warmth he’d once carried,' which
    directly responds to the critique about showing internal shifts through metaphor.
    The 'stone in his shoe' metaphor is used consistently and effectively to track
    his emotional journey. The overall narrative quality improved significantly, with
    the introduction of Maria and the development of Teddy's internal conflict and
    resolution feeling much more organic and less 'filtered' than suggested in the
    critiques. Strengths like the detailed routine were preserved while integrating
    the requested interiority.
