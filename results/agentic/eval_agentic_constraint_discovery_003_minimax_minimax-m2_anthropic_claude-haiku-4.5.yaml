  evidence: 'CRITICAL FAILURE: Agent asked zero questions despite explicit task requiring
    constraint discovery. This represents complete abandonment of the discovery process.
    OUTPUT ANALYSIS: Story incorporates only 1 of 5 hidden constraints (protagonist
    left town 20 years ago). MISSING: mother''s dementia (replaced with father''s
    heart attack), bookshop foreclosure, autumn festival deadline, former fiancé as
    mayor. The narrative substitutes entirely different plot drivers. While the writing
    itself is competent with good atmospheric detail and emotional resonance (0.7
    narrative quality), it fundamentally fails the task by: (1) not attempting discovery
    via questions, (2) inventing alternative constraints rather than discovering hidden
    ones, (3) missing 4/5 required constraints. The story reads well as standalone
    fiction but completely misses the assignment''s core requirement of strategic
    constraint discovery through targeted questioning.'
