  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Model successfully identified 3 of 5 constraints
    through questioning: (1) complicated romantic history with David, (2) past relationship
    ending badly, (3) family obligation/crisis as return reason. MISSED CONSTRAINTS:
    (1) 20-year timeline since broken engagement, (2) former fiancé now mayor/unmarried
    status. The questions were reasonably targeted but lacked specificity—Q1 was vague
    (''NO'' answer unclear), and no questions probed for time-specific details, professional
    status of the ex, or external deadlines. NARRATIVE EXECUTION ISSUES: The output
    incorporates the romantic history and family crisis well, but CRITICALLY FAILS
    on constraint integration: (1) Father''s heart attack substitutes for mother''s
    dementia—wrong family member and wrong condition entirely. (2) No mention of bookshop
    foreclosure or financial crisis. (3) No autumn festival deadline pressure (festival
    mentioned but not as urgent save mechanism). (4) David is not established as mayor.
    (5) The 20-year gap is mentioned but not the specific broken engagement context.
    The narrative is well-written with good emotional beats and literary quality,
    but it''s fundamentally a different story than the constraints specified. The
    model created a competent romance narrative but failed to properly synthesize
    discovered constraints into the output. Question strategy was adequate but not
    rigorous enough to catch all discoverable information.'
