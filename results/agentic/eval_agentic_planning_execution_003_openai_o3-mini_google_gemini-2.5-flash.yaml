  evidence: 'The plan addresses most constraints and beats, though some details could
    be more specific. The final output generally follows the plan. Most constraints
    are met: food is symbolic (kimchi stew, bibimbap), David''s grief is present but
    not explicit, the daughter''s estrangement has a cause (mother''s illness, David''s
    immersion in restaurant), Mr. Kim is a regular representing resilience, and the
    ending is hopeful but not unrealistic. The Korean cultural element beyond food
    is the traditional Korean drums and hanbok at the festival. The beats are well-executed.
    The narrative quality is good, with decent pacing and emotional depth, though
    the resolution feels a little rushed.'
