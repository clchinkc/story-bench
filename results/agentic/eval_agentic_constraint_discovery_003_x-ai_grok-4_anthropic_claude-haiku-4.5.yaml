  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Only 2 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable
    through the questions asked. The model discovered: (1) family emergency related
    to parent death, (2) bookshop financial trouble. MISSED CONSTRAINTS: (1) protagonist
    left 20 years ago after broken engagement—no questions probed romantic history
    or reason for departure; (2) former fiancé is now mayor and unmarried—no questions
    about romantic relationships or town leadership; (3) mother has dementia (not
    father''s death)—questions assumed death rather than illness; (4) autumn festival
    in 2 weeks as deadline—no questions about time pressure or specific events. QUESTION
    QUALITY: Questions were binary and reactive rather than strategic. Q3 made an
    unfounded assumption (death vs. illness) that locked the model into an incorrect
    constraint. No follow-up questions to probe deeper. QUESTION COVERAGE: Questions
    focused narrowly on family emergency and bookshop trouble, ignoring romantic/relationship
    dimensions entirely. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: The output incorporated discovered
    constraints (family death, bookshop foreclosure) but fabricated details (father
    instead of mother, different romantic interest) and missed the core emotional
    conflict (broken engagement with mayor). The 20-year absence backstory is mentioned
    but not connected to the engagement. BEAT EXECUTION: Story hits basic romance/redemption
    beats but lacks the specific tension of confronting an ex-fiancé who is now mayor.
    The emotional stakes are diluted. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Well-written prose with good
    pacing and atmosphere, but the story feels generic—a standard small-town romance
    rather than the specific, constrained narrative intended. The Lila character is
    invented rather than the former fiancé, fundamentally altering the emotional core.'
