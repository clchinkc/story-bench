  evidence: 'The revision trajectory shows strong responsiveness to critique feedback
    on character_interiority. Early critiques (0.68-0.78) identified that Teddy''s
    inner life was ''suggested through habit'' but ''rarely explored directly'' and
    ''unevenly distributed.'' The final output addresses this through: (1) expanded
    interiority during the disruption moment—''His thumb presses the glass shard until
    the edge bites. The prickle of guilt surprises him''—showing direct emotional
    exploration rather than metaphor alone; (2) consistent distribution of internal
    moments throughout (the thermos ritual, the Saturday throat-catch, the trembling
    hand with the marker); (3) deepened specificity in grief processing (''as if turning
    right would be a small betrayal''). All 5 constraints are satisfied: Teddy''s
    routine is shown with loving detail (6:07 ritual, worry-stone, thermos, crack-counting);
    the disruption (fence/water main) reveals avoidance of the garden/Irene; Maya
    serves as intersecting neighbor whose story (new to block, teaching, garden volunteer)
    mirrors Teddy''s need for renewal; Irene''s absence permeates through the thermos,
    the garden memory, and culminates in the named bed; the new path (community garden,
    shared labor, naming Irene publicly) offers connection and purpose the solitary
    route couldn''t. Story Circle beats execute cleanly: status quo (routine walk),
    inciting incident (fence blocks path), crisis (choice between left/right), climax
    (entering garden, writing Irene''s name), new equilibrium (kneeling, teaching,
    sharing coffee). Prose quality strengthens through revision—sensory specificity
    increases, emotional beats land through action rather than exposition, and the
    final image (circle of faces, shared thermos) resonates with earned weight. Minor
    weakness: the alley detour feels slightly rushed compared to the deliberate pacing
    elsewhere, but this serves narrative momentum. The output demonstrates calibrated
    improvement: not overcorrecting into melodrama, but deepening interiority while
    maintaining the subtle, action-driven style that made early critiques note ''strong
    moments'' existed.'
