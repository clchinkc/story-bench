  evidence: "The agent discovered 3 out of 5 constraints. It correctly identified\
    \ that it's not a second-chance romance, the love interest is a local, and the\
    \ festival is central to the romance. It also correctly identified family conflict.\
    \ However, it missed the specific nature of the family conflict (mother's dementia)\
    \ and the reason for the protagonist's return (mother's dementia), and the bookshop\
    \ foreclosure/saving it. The questions were generally strategic, but the follow-up\
    \ questions didn't dig deep enough into the 'family conflict' to uncover the specific\
    \ nature of the conflict or the mother's dementia. The final question about staying\
    \ in town was a good attempt to uncover a key plot point, but the 'NO' answer\
    \ was misleading given the actual constraints. \n\nFor constraint satisfaction,\
    \ the story correctly avoids a second-chance romance, features a local love interest\
    \ (Jo), and uses the festival as a central element for the romance and family\
    \ reconciliation. It also incorporates family conflict with the brother. However,\
    \ it completely misses the mother's dementia, the reason for the protagonist's\
    \ return (which is tied to the mother), and the bookshop being in foreclosure\
    \ and needing to be saved. Instead, the protagonist is opening a new bookshop.\
    \ \n\nBeat execution is good; the story has clear exposition, rising action, and\
    \ climax. The narrative quality is decent, with engaging prose and a clear emotional\
    \ arc, despite missing key plot elements."
