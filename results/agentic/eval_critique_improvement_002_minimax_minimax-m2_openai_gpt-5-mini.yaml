  evidence: Across versions 0–3 changes were largely cosmetic and polishing (punctuation,
    tightening sentences, minor phrasing) rather than structural. The core emotional
    beats and craft-of-comedy details were present from the start and were preserved;
    later rounds clarified language and sharpened the emotional payoff (the erasing-the-board
    moment and the executive beat), but the revisions did not materially alter scene
    structure or address the single failing constraint (Marcus laughs only after his
    sadness is signaled). Overall clarity and emotional immediacy improved modestly,
    strengths were preserved, but responsiveness to critique requests for larger structural/constraint
    fixes was limited.
