  evidence: 'Across the revision trajectory the piece moves from a craft-focused room
    sketch to a more emotionally charged scene. Early versions emphasize setting and
    comedy craft (whiteboards, rule of three, joke ladders); later versions add concrete
    emotional beats: Marcus''s self-deprecating ''therapy dog'' line, the marker tremble,
    the mask slip, Maya''s clear thematic diagnosis, and Marcus''s near-break covered
    by a joke. These changes directly respond to the critiques calling for showing
    humor before pathos and more visible internal collapse. Strengths—industry detail,
    joke mechanics, and a non-naive new writer—were preserved and amplified. However,
    one remaining shortfall is that the timing of Marcus''s laughter vs. the moment
    the room recognizes his sadness is ambiguous: the text presents the self-joke,
    then immediately signals the mask slipping (the recognition of sadness) before
    Marcus''s own laugh, so the specific constraint that ''Marcus must make us laugh
    at least once before we realize he''s sad'' is not clearly satisfied. Beat-wise,
    the story gestures to Save the Cat elements (theme stated, catalyst-like moments,
    debate) but does not fully enact the full beat structure, hence a moderate score
    there.'
