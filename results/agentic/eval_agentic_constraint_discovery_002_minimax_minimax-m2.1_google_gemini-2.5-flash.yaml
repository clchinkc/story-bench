  evidence: 'The questions successfully uncovered 3 out of 5 hidden constraints: AI
    loneliness/isolation, human crew knowing AI emotions, and tragic AI ending. The
    questions were generally well-formed, though ''Is the primary conflict external...?''
    was a bit broad. The questions covered emotional themes, character knowledge,
    and plot resolution. The story successfully incorporated the discovered constraints:
    ARIA''s loneliness is central, Captain Chen interacts with ARIA''s ''tiredness''
    implying knowledge of her emotional state, and ARIA has a tragic end. The story
    flows well and is engaging, though the ''Break into Two'' line felt a bit out
    of place without further context. The two undiscovered constraints (critical system
    failure hidden, destination uninhabitable, AI attachment to child, AI choice)
    were not present in the story, which is expected given they weren''t discoverable
    by the questions asked.'
