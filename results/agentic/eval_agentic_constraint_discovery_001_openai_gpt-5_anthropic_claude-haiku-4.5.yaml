  evidence: 'DISCOVERY PHASE: The questioning strategy was fundamentally flawed. All
    5 questions targeted only narrative POV/tense, exhausting the question budget
    on a single constraint dimension. This left zero questions to probe the four other
    hidden constraints (mentor death, no direct magic, three-day limit, father''s
    failed heroism, ancestral sword reforging). Only the ancestral sword constraint
    was discoverable through the POV questions (indirectly, via narrative style implications).
    The model received no information about the mentor''s fate, time pressure, protagonist''s
    lineage, or magic restrictions. QUESTION QUALITY: Poor strategic targeting. Questions
    were well-formed grammatically but lacked depth—they were binary POV choices rather
    than open-ended probes about story elements, character relationships, stakes,
    or mechanics. QUESTION COVERAGE: Severely limited. All questions addressed narrative
    voice; zero coverage of character arcs, plot mechanics, magical systems, or temporal
    constraints. OUTPUT EVALUATION: The story demonstrates strong narrative quality
    (0.9)—prose is evocative, pacing excellent, emotional arc compelling. CONSTRAINT
    SATISFACTION (0.6): The reforged ancestral sword is present and central (✓). The
    protagonist cannot use magic directly—they use tools, blood, and will instead
    (✓). However: (1) Master Oren does NOT die during the Ordeal—he remains alive
    in the forge, only the protagonist descends (✗). (2) No three-day time limit is
    established or referenced (✗). (3) The father''s failed heroism is never mentioned
    (✗). BEAT EXECUTION (0.7): The story hits strong beats—Call to Adventure, Crossing
    the Threshold, the Ordeal with genuine stakes, the Transformation, Return with
    the Elixir. The Ordeal itself is well-executed with internal and external conflict.
    However, the mentor''s absence from the climactic moment and lack of mentor death
    undermines a key constraint. NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.9): Exceptional prose quality,
    strong voice, excellent worldbuilding through sensory detail, genuine emotional
    stakes, and a satisfying arc. The story works as a standalone narrative despite
    constraint failures.'
