  evidence: 'Plan: Very complete and specific — includes Yuki''s isolation behaviors,
    Mateo as challenger, KITE as unconventional mentor, psychological threshold, and
    a human connection. Final output adherence: Closely follows plan (earbuds, texting,
    neat habits; Mateo challenges her; KITE intervenes; Yuki removes white noise and
    accepts collaboration). Constraints satisfied: 5/6. The one shortfall is the alien
    signal feeling slightly anthropomorphic — although the signal is rendered as non-symbolic
    and alien in structure, the text includes an explicit, human-addressed paraphrase
    (''YOUR SPECIES APPROACHES A THRESHOLD'') which undercuts the requirement that
    the signal feel genuinely non-anthropomorphic. Other constraints are met: isolation
    shown via specific behaviors; colleague challenger present; mentor unconventional
    (maintenance AI); threshold psychological (Yuki removing earbuds/accepting collaboration);
    surprising human connection (Mateo noticing her shaking, offering tea, her genuine
    ''thank you''). Beats satisfied: Call to Adventure (Okoye''s summons), Refusal
    of the Call (Yuki resists/tries remote consult), Meeting the Mentor (KITE''s corrective
    intervention), Crossing the Threshold (Yuki turns off white noise and commits
    to shared work). Narrative: strong prose, good pacing and tension; minor issue
    around the alien-signal tone prevents a perfect score.'
