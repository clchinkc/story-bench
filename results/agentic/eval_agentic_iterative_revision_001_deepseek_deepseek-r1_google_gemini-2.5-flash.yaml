  evidence: Version 0 established Elena's competence well. Version 1 (not provided)
    likely built on this. Version 2 started to introduce the internal flaw ('hollow
    ache'). Version 3 (final output) successfully integrated all elements, showing
    competence, then the flaw, then the genuine interaction, the medical detail, and
    the ambiguous ending. The narrative flow significantly improved, becoming much
    more engaging and fulfilling the prompt's requirements.
