  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on the 'youth_voice' criterion, specifically
    pointing out instances where Zara's internal monologue or descriptions felt too
    adult. The revisions, particularly from V0 to V3 and the final output, show a
    clear effort to address this. For example, the line 'They looked at the ocean
    and saw a grave; she looked at it and saw a puzzle waiting to be solved' (cited
    as weak in Critique 1) was removed. The 'struggling hydroponics bay' line (cited
    in Critique 2) was rephrased to 'The hydroponics bay has been dying by inches
    for months. We’re eating slime,' which grounds the problem more in Zara's immediate,
    visceral experience. The final output also adds more physical sensations and immediate
    reactions ('her arms were burning,' 'her face burning,' 'cold terror mixing with
    the adrenaline') that enhance the youthful perspective. Strengths like 'Come on,
    you stupid piece of junk' and 'Jackpot, she whispered' were retained. The story
    successfully integrates all constraints, including Zara's ingenuity (Barnacles,
    bypassing the regulator, saving the boat from debris), the adult dismissal ('It’s
    a ghost story, Zara. Go fix a toaster.'), the flawed mentor (Jax's fear and past
    trauma), and real danger (Hurricane Silas, the Shallows, debris). The narrative
    quality is strong, with vivid worldbuilding and a good balance of hope and realism.
