  evidence: The critical issue of incompleteness was highlighted in all three critiques,
    yet the story remains incomplete in the final output. No substantive changes were
    made to address the core problem. The only change was a minor wording tweak in
    the opening sentence, which does not address any of the critical feedback. The
    story still cuts off mid-sentence, preventing evaluation of most criteria.
