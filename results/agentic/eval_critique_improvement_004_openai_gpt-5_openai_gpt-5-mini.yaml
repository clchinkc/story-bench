  evidence: 'Early versions presented strong surface details (the thermos, the green
    glass shard, the door groan) but stayed short and suggested interiority only in
    isolated lines. Across revisions the author added a clear disrupting obstacle
    (water-main closure), a concrete detour that introduces Maya and the Bartlett
    Community Garden, and a scene in which Teddy names a bed ''IRENE.'' These additions
    turn habit into choice, reveal the grief he''s been avoiding, and create the new-path
    payoff (community, purpose, and the opportunity to memorialize his wife) that
    the old route could not offer. The final draft preserves the original small, loving
    details while adding sustained interior moments (guilt, physical sensations, the
    thumb biting the glass, the tremor when writing), clearer beat progression (comfort
    → disruption → unfamiliar route → encounter → decision → small transformation),
    and stronger intersection with a neighbor''s story. Remaining limits: some interior
    beats are still conveyed more by implication than explicit reflection, which keeps
    emotion subtle but unevenly distributed.'
