  evidence: 'Only 1/5 hidden constraints was directly discoverable from the questions
    (that a specific magical item must be forged). Questions were reasonable but missed
    key constraint areas (mentor death, magic-use prohibition, time limit, ancestral
    reforging). The story does use the forging as the Ordeal (executed well) but fails
    every other hidden constraint: the mentor survives, the protagonist directly channels
    magical flame, there is no three-day time limit, the father-as-failed-hero is
    absent, and no broken ancestral sword is reforged. Prose and pacing are strong,
    but constraint adherence is poor.'
