  evidence: 'All six constraints are demonstrated: Yuki''s isolation is shown via
    concrete behaviors (ignoring calls, turning from neighbor, snapping at a tech);
    the alien signal is described as non-linear fractal echoes/quantum resonances
    (non-anthropomorphic); Dr. Raj Patel challenges her approach; Elias the janitor
    is an unconventional mentor; the Threshold is internal (fear of vulnerability,
    choosing to collaborate); and a surprising human connection occurs when Yuki accepts
    Elias''s tea and warmth. All four required beats appear (Call: summons to Antarctica;
    Refusal: Yuki''s retreat and ''I can''t connect...'' / snapping at others; Meeting
    the Mentor: Elias in blackout; Crossing the Threshold: deciding to collaborate).
    The story is well-paced and effective, though not highly literary—hence narrative_quality
    = 0.8.'
