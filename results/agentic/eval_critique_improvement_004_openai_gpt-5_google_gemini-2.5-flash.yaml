  evidence: The initial critiques highlighted a need for deeper exploration of Teddy's
    inner life, moving beyond mere suggestion. The revisions, particularly in the
    final output, significantly address this. Details like 'He counts cracks the way
    other men count blessings,' 'His mouth works around Saturday. The word feels like
    a door,' and the internal conflict around turning right ('as if turning right
    would be a small betrayal') directly respond to the feedback for more explicit
    interiority. The moment he writes 'IRENE' on the sign is a powerful culmination
    of this. The core strengths of the initial descriptions (the thermos, the worry
    stone, the routine) were maintained while weaving in more internal thought and
    emotional processing, showing a clear improvement trajectory.
