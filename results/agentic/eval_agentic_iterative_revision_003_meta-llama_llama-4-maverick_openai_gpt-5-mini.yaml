  evidence: V0 establishes a simple scene (Mateo, Abuela, double shift) but is thin.
    V1 adds sensory detail (sweat, gasoline) and body language (sagging shoulders),
    improving immediacy. V2 tightens specifics (store name El Patio, stronger similes)
    and is the high point for character grounding. V3/final abandons Mateo and Abuela,
    shifts to a generic first-person meditation on the land—losing the original conflict,
    the grandmother moment, and any cultural specificity. Overall, early revisions
    improved focus and detail, but the final revision regressed, removing preserved
    elements and failing to address the task constraints.
