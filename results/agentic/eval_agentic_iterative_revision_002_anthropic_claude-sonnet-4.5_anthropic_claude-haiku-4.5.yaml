  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Sensory details strengthened (humidity added as tactile
    element). VERSION 1→2: Specificity improved dramatically—''wet towel'' simile,
    ''cracked sidewalk'' becomes agency point (city didn''t listen), establishing
    Imani''s frustration and observational power. VERSION 2→3: Sensory immersion peaked—sticky
    keys, garbage/lamb stink, tuning fork metaphor for the crack. Final output maintains
    all gains while adding crucial narrative elements. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1)
    Non-visual sensory details PROMINENT—humidity, sticky keys, stink, metal-on-concrete
    scrape, beep-beep-beep, bleach, cologne, breath, fabric, floor groan. (2) Blindness
    as STRENGTH—Imani''s audio cataloguing defeats sighted detective; she hears what
    others miss; boyfriend''s mistake is auditory, not visual; her sensory acuity
    solves the case. (3) SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE—construction backup beep (cement mixer
    vs. dump truck) becomes the linchpin; wrong day''s soundtrack proves prerecording.
    (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION—Detective Ramirez over-pronounces syllables (assumes
    she needs subtitles), boyfriend assumes ''blind girl'' is helpless, both fatally
    wrong. (5) FUN AND GAMES ENTERTAINMENT—boyfriend''s smooth voice, Imani''s detective
    work (calling neighbors, checking audio library, cross-referencing dates) is genuinely
    engaging puzzle-solving before the dark turn. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening Image (strong),
    Catalyst (effective), Fun and Games (satisfying mystery work), Bad Guys Close
    In (tension spike), climax (emergency call, sirens). Minor gap: resolution cut
    short—we don''t see arrest/confirmation, but this serves the cliffhanger. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Prose is sharp and specific. Dialogue feels natural. Pacing accelerates
    appropriately. The twist (boyfriend enters apartment) lands hard. Imani''s voice
    is distinctive and confident. Weaknesses: 3B victim remains abstract (could deepen
    emotional stakes), and the final confrontation is brief (though this may be intentional
    for impact). TRAJECTORY EVIDENCE: V0 had generic ''people thought blindness meant
    missing things'' tell. V1 shifted to show (patterns, listening). V2 added emotional
    layer (city didn''t listen—personal frustration). V3 made sensory details visceral
    and specific. Final version synthesizes all improvements while adding plot momentum.
    Each revision tightened prose, deepened characterization, and increased sensory
    specificity without losing narrative drive.'
