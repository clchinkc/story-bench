  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions, especially from V0
    to V1, and then V1 to V2/V3. The initial versions were very sparse, only setting
    up the premise. The final version fully develops the scene, characters, and conflict.
    The core elements (Mateo's internal conflict, Berkeley vs. ASU, Abuela's role)
    were preserved and expanded upon. All constraints appear to be met. Mateo's internal
    conflict is shown through his actions (gripping paintbrush, staring at paint chips,
    feeling like garbage) and his eventual outburst. The moment with Abuela is specific
    and crystallizes his choice, moving from guilt to understanding. Mr. Chen genuinely
    understands Mateo's dilemma, offering a poignant parallel. Cultural elements (fideo,
    quinceañera, albondigas, 'mejor') are woven in authentically. The resolution is
    earned through Abuela's powerful speech, shifting Mateo's guilt into a more complex
    emotion of gratitude and hope, demonstrating his growth.
