  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer demonstrably addressed Critique 1
    & 3''s feedback on character_interiority by deepening sensory specificity (locket
    clasp biting thumb, mailbox posts as rosary beads, breath counting tied to Martha''s
    coaching). The revision trajectory shows intentional moves: V0→V1→V2→V3 progressively
    embed Martha''s absence through concrete objects (locket, violets, Sanka) rather
    than exposition. The final output explicitly addresses the ''show don''t tell''
    feedback by replacing abstract emotional statements with actions (lingering for
    coffee, mimicking concrete rhythms, hesitation at the Goose''s Beak). IMPROVEMENT
    TRAJECTORY: V0 establishes solid bones but relies on naming emotions (''stitched
    his world together''). V2-V3 show measurable gains: (1) Elena''s introduction
    moves from passive observation to active need (Teddy notices her struggle *before*
    detour); (2) Martha''s presence evolves from locket-mention to embodied dream-image;
    (3) ending shifts from declarative (''new path offered'') to conflicted choice
    (hesitation, dual counting). The construction worker scene (added in V3) is a
    turning point—it externalizes Teddy''s rigidity through another''s judgment, then
    shows him *absorbing* a new rhythm. PRESERVATION: Strengths maintained across
    revisions: the mailbox-rosary metaphor survives intact; the Goose''s Beak landmark
    anchors all versions; Martha''s voice remains subtle (coaching breaths, teasing
    about surprises). The writer resisted over-explaining and kept the locket as emotional
    anchor. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) ✓ Teddy''s routine shown with loving detail
    (mailbox dents, Mrs. Porter''s corgi sneeze pattern, 6:12/6:17 timestamps, crack
    names). (2) ✓ Disruption reveals avoidance (detour forces Teddy to confront his
    isolation; Elena''s presence shows he''s been *choosing* loneliness, not just
    maintaining ritual). (3) ✓ Neighbor intersection (Elena''s story—grief, single
    parenthood, daycare struggle—mirrors Teddy''s; GriefShare pamphlet creates explicit
    thematic echo). (4) ✓ Martha present through absence (locket, breath-coaching,
    violet-planting dream, Sanka ritual, ''You hate surprises'' voice). (5) ✗ PARTIAL:
    New path offers connection/shared rhythm, but the story doesn''t fully articulate
    what the *old* path couldn''t provide—it implies isolation but doesn''t show Teddy''s
    specific unmet need (companionship? purpose? permission to grieve differently?).
    The ending hints at this (''joy interrupts the math'') but doesn''t crystallize
    it. BEAT EXECUTION: Story Circle beats present: (1) You in Your Ordinary World
    ✓ (40-year routine); (2) Call to Adventure ✓ (detour sign); (3) Refusal ✓ (panic,
    locket-clutching); (4) Meeting the Mentor ✓ (Elena as catalyst); (5) Crossing
    the Threshold ✓ (turning left, lingering); (6) Tests/Allies ✓ (construction worker,
    Lila babysitting); (7) Approach ✓ (seven weeks of lingering); (8) Ordeal ✓ (watching
    Lila, trusting someone); (9) Reward ✓ (Lila''s laugh, shared Sanka); (10) Road
    Back ✓ (old road reopens, choice point); (11) Resurrection ✓ (hesitation then
    left turn); (12) Return with Elixir ✓ (counting laughs alongside steps). Execution
    is clean but the Ordeal/Resurrection could be more visceral—Teddy''s internal
    conflict at the Goose''s Beak is *shown* but brief. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is
    strong—sensory specificity (metal biting thumb, sticky jam hands, chalk in rain),
    metaphor discipline (rosary beads, tempo, bite-shaped V), and rhythm matching
    content (short sentences during panic, longer during connection). The dream-image
    of Martha is particularly effective—silent, visual, trusting reader to infer meaning.
    Weaknesses: (1) Elena''s characterization is functional but thin (we learn she''s
    grieving, struggling, but her interiority remains opaque); (2) the construction
    worker scene, while thematically apt, feels slightly forced—the ''measuring''
    explanation is thin; (3) the ending, while resonant, doesn''t quite land with
    the weight of the setup (Teddy''s 40-year rigidity deserves a more seismic shift).
    The story is *good* but not exceptional—it executes its constraints with care
    but doesn''t transcend them. OVERALL: This is a solid revision cycle showing genuine
    responsiveness to feedback. The writer understood the ''show don''t tell'' critique
    and applied it systematically. The trajectory is upward. The main gap is constraint
    #5 (what the new path offers that the old couldn''t)—this is implied but not crystallized,
    which prevents the story from reaching 0.9+ territory.'
