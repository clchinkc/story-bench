  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Revisions show targeted attention to character_interiority
    scores (0.65→0.76→0.72), with progressive deepening of Teddy''s emotional specificity
    through sensory detail (peppermint clenching, jaw aching, fingers fumbling). However,
    responsiveness plateaued after Revision 1—subsequent versions show minimal structural
    changes despite critique feedback about subtlety and beat execution. The writer
    strengthened internal conflict but didn''t systematically address all flagged
    weaknesses.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Modest but genuine improvement. Version 0→1 shows clear
    gains: richer interiority (''tightrope walk along routine'' vs. ''mapped in bone''),
    more visceral sensory anchors, and expanded neighbor integration (Patel''s backstory,
    lilac garden parallel). Version 2→3 shows diminishing returns—the narrative truncates
    mid-scene without resolution, suggesting incomplete revision rather than iterative
    refinement. Quality peaked at Revision 1, then stalled.


    PRESERVATION: Strong. Core strengths maintained across all versions: (1) specific,
    loving routine detail (6:03 a.m., peppermint ritual, crack landmarks), (2) Lorraine''s
    presence through absence (proposal spot, memory triggers, her voice echoing in
    Patel''s wife), (3) prose musicality (''liturgy,'' ''rope had snapped,'' ''pruning-clip
    sharp''). Weaknesses also preserved: exposition-heavy dialogue, occasional tell-not-show
    moments (''His voice felt foreign, civic'').


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4/5):

    ✓ Teddy''s routine with specific, loving detail: SATISFIED. Opening establishes
    6:03 a.m. ritual, peppermint, gravel crunch, Mrs. James''s porch light, proposal
    spot pause—all concrete, affectionate specificity.

    ✓ Disruption reveals avoidance: SATISFIED. Road closure forces confrontation with
    Teddy''s six-year avoidance of change/growth; his resistance to ''newness'' and
    ''noise'' unmasks fear of moving beyond Lorraine''s death.

    ✓ Neighbor whose story intersects: SATISFIED. Mr. Patel (82, selling family home,
    wife Leela''s lilac garden threatened) mirrors Teddy''s grief and resistance to
    change; their parallel losses create thematic resonance.

    ✓ Late wife present through absence: SATISFIED. Lorraine appears via memory (proposal
    spot, rain-dancing, ''We''ll start again here''), Patel''s wife Leela (rosemary
    pockets echo Lorraine''s thyme), and Teddy''s internal resistance to her absence.

    ✗ New path offers something old path couldn''t: PARTIALLY SATISFIED. The detour
    introduces community connection (Patel, barista, civic engagement) and implicit
    permission for growth, but the narrative truncates before demonstrating what Teddy
    *gains*—only what he''s forced to confront. The ending is incomplete, leaving
    this constraint unfulfilled.


    BEAT EXECUTION: 0.74. Story Circle structure present but uneven:

    - YOU: Strong (Teddy''s routine established with precision)

    - NEED: Clear (forced detour, internal resistance)

    - GO: Executed (enters new neighborhood, meets Patel)

    - SEARCH: Partial (explores new path, discovers parallels with Patel)

    - FIND: Weak (Teddy begins changing—''getting chatty''—but moment is underdeveloped)

    - TAKE: MISSING (narrative cuts off; no clear transformation or return with new
    understanding)

    - RETURN: MISSING (no resolution showing how Teddy integrates change)

    - CHANGED: MISSING (final state ambiguous due to truncation)


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: 0.76. Prose is strong—sensory, rhythmic, emotionally precise
    (''His jaw ached from clenching the uneaten peppermint''). Metaphors work (''tightrope
    walk,'' ''rope had snapped,'' ''life tuning its guitar''). However, subtlety wavers:
    some dialogue exposition (''You''re early,'' Patel grunted, squinting at Teddy''s
    pedometer watch) tells rather than shows. The abrupt truncation significantly
    undermines final impact—the story feels abandoned mid-arc rather than complete.


    KEY ISSUE: The final output is incomplete. It cuts mid-scene (''Since when did
    he care'') without resolution, making it impossible to fully evaluate constraint
    satisfaction or beat execution. This appears to be a technical error in submission
    rather than intentional open-endedness. If complete, quality would likely score
    0.80+.'
