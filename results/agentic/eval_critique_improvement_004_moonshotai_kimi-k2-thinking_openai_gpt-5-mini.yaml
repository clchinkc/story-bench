  evidence: 'Early critiques focused on Teddy''s interiority feeling remote and largely
    surface-level. Across the revision rounds the core, evocative lines were preserved
    (the knee pop, the rosary-like sidewalk, the clockwork timing), but the intermediate
    versions appear largely unchanged from the excerpts provided. The final output,
    however, expands the scene substantially: it layers in more interior detail (the
    three-mile loop measured in memories, his avoidance of the cemetery, Marianne''s
    remembered laugh, his daughter''s weekly calls), introduces the detour as a concrete
    disruption (the ''Street Closed'' sign and the cemetery), and adds a neighbor
    (Sarah) whose project thematically intersects with Teddy''s preservation/avoidance.
    These changes show responsiveness to the critiques by deepening context and adding
    intersecting character action, but they stop short of fully resolving the critique
    that Teddy''s inner life remain somewhat distant—many interior states are still
    reported rather than fully dramatized. Similarly, the Story Circle is evident
    in broad strokes (comfort/routine → disruption → unfamiliar path → encounter/revelation)
    but lacks a clear, paid-for turn or decisive change by the end, so beat execution
    is partial rather than complete.'
