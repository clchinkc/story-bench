  evidence: Across the three revision markers the piece retained its core opening
    (Teddy's precise wake time, sneakers, three-mile walk) while gradually adding
    connective detail and characters. Early critiques flagged thin interiority and
    'telling' language. The final version responds by adding more sensory specifics
    (aroma of roasted coffee, vibrant murals, begonias, the cream stirred three times)
    and a concrete neighbor-arc (Carla and her daughter) that intersects with Teddy
    (teaching the child to tie shoes). This strengthens the constraint work (routine,
    neighbor, Margaret's absence, construction disruption, new path benefits). However,
    some passages still resort to explicit exposition of feeling (“the ache... begin
    to dissolve,” “felt like a betrayal”), so interiority improved but remains partly
    told rather than fully shown. Overall the revisions preserved strengths (routine
    specificity, community texture) and added new beats (park, Carla), producing modest
    but incomplete remediation of the original critiques.
