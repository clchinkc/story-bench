  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with clear beat structure and specific
    behavioral details (nutrient paste, back-facing desk, ARIA interactions). All
    4 required beats present and well-executed: Call (signal arrival), Refusal (remote
    work excuse), Mentor (Webb challenges her), Threshold (neural interface requiring
    vulnerability). Isolation shown through concrete behaviors rather than exposition.
    Alien signal genuinely alien—quantum-entangled, non-linear, recursive, existing
    in superposition. Human connection moment (Jin''s hand-holding) genuinely surprising
    and earned. WEAKNESSES: Mentor figure (Webb) is somewhat conventional—appears
    briefly to deliver critique rather than guide through transformation. Plan mentions
    ''unconventional mentor'' but execution is fairly standard wise-colleague archetype.
    Colleague challenge (Webb''s confrontation) is present but could be more integrated
    into narrative arc. Signal''s emotional resonance (''cry for help'') borders on
    slight anthropomorphization despite strong non-linear mathematics foundation.
    CONSTRAINT GAPS: 1/6 constraint partially underexecuted—mentor unconventionality.
    NARRATIVE: Strong pacing, effective use of sensory details, Jin''s character provides
    genuine emotional anchor. Threshold crossing is psychological (vulnerability/openness)
    not physical. Final revelation about connection vs. isolation lands effectively.
    Minor issue: resolution feels slightly rushed in final paragraphs.'
