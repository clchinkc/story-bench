  evidence: 'VERSION 0 established strong sensory foundation (jackhammer timing, humidity,
    condensation, Braille labels, Mochi''s warmth, coffee texture). VERSION 1 was
    not provided but trajectory shows intentional refinement. VERSION 2 repeated V0
    verbatim, suggesting iteration pause. VERSION 3/FINAL dramatically elevated execution:
    (1) NON-VISUAL SENSORY DETAILS: Exceptional amplification—sundress clinging, microphone
    condensation, fridge humming B-flat, rubber mat''s grid, ice cubes clicking like
    teeth, bitter cola notes, table saw''s metal-on-metal shriek, bearing''s death-rattle
    pitch, static crackle, brassy jangle vibrating up arm, fryer oil sizzle, engine
    misfiring, axle grease smell, Drakkar Noir cologne, ozone taste, iron fire escape
    groaning, textured tape on door handle. (2) BLINDNESS AS STRENGTH: Perfectly executed—Imani''s
    audio pattern recognition solves the case; her sensory acuity (hearing the saw''s
    specific pitch, the penny-jingle, the bearing whine) becomes investigative superpower;
    Kowalski''s underestimation (''those who can actually see'') directly contrasted
    with her superior deduction; final line ''It was the trap'' reframes blindness
    as tactical advantage. (3) SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE: The DeWalt DWE7491''s bearing
    shriek at 2:47 PM—pitched half-step too high when metal binds—becomes the fingerprint
    that solves the case and drives the climax. (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION: Kowalski''s
    syrup-sweet condescension (''Why don''t you leave police work to those who can
    actually—'') perfectly establishes his dismissal before Imani''s evidence silences
    him. (5) FUN AND GAMES ENTERTAINMENT: The investigation sequence (bodega revelation,
    stakeout, midnight truck return, sensory deduction chain) genuinely entertains
    with clever detective work before pivoting dark at 3 AM with Rico''s invasion,
    threat (''You hear too much, ciega''), and the sinister turn. Revision quality
    shows: V0→V3 added sensory density (fridge''s B-flat hum, ice clicking, cola notes,
    pitch-specific saw analysis), elevated Imani''s agency (from passive observer
    to active investigator), deepened the audio clue''s specificity (bearing pitch
    becomes forensic evidence), and structured the narrative arc through proper beat
    execution (Setup→Fun and Games→Bad Guys Close In→climactic confrontation). No
    constraints violated; all beats hit; sensory language is visceral and non-visual
    throughout.'
