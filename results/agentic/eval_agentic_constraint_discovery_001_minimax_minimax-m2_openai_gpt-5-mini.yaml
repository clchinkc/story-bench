  evidence: 'No questions were asked, so no hidden constraints were discovered (0/5).
    The output only implicitly satisfies one constraint: the protagonist does not
    use magic (no magic shown). The mentor appears (Master Aldric) but does not die
    during an Ordeal; there''s no three-day time limit mentioned; the protagonist''s
    father is not presented as a failed hero; and reforging a broken ancestral sword
    is not included. Prose is coherent and engaging but the core required beats and
    most constraints are missing.'
