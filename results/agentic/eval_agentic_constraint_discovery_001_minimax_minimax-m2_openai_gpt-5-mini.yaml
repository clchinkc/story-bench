  evidence: None of the five hidden constraints were revealed by the questions or
    answers. Questions asked about family, the nature of the darkness, personal stake,
    a sacrifice, and a selfless victory — these are reasonable narrative probes but
    they did not target the specific hidden mechanics (mentor death, no direct magic
    use, three-day time limit, failed-hero father, reforging an ancestral sword).
    The produced story does incorporate the family and non-physical darkness elements
    (consistent with some Q/A), but it fails to include any of the five required hidden
    constraints, so constraint satisfaction and beat execution are 0. Narrative quality
    is middling-to-good (engaging opening, clear mood and stakes) hence 0.7.
