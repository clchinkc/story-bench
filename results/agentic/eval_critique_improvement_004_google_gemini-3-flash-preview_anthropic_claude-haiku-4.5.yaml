  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer systematically addressed the primary
    weakness flagged across all three critiques—vague interiority. Early versions
    contained abstract rumination (''his mind was often elsewhere''). Final version
    deepens this with specific, sensory details: the rehearsed words at the coffee
    shop, the reflexive check for Martha''s grocery list, the hollow tick of the wall
    clock. The barista scene now reveals concrete social anxiety rather than stating
    it. Score: 0.85 (strong response, though some abstract language remains in ''the
    silence of the last three years'').


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Across revisions, prose tightened significantly. V0→V1:
    Eliminated redundancy (''worn thin''→''worn into''), sharpened sensory language
    (''sour-sweet scent''→''sour-sweet breath''). V1→V2: Converted passive construction
    to active (''were shaved''→''were shaved into''), added specificity (''Detroit
    air''). V2→V3: Removed ''damp'' before ''Detroit air'' (tightening), added the
    crucial final sentence about feet remembering hazards. Final version adds the
    entire coffee shop scene and Sarah subplot, demonstrating willingness to expand
    rather than merely polish. Score: 0.82 (clear improvement, though some early versions
    already contained strong bones).


    PRESERVATION: The opening image—worn shoe heels as topographic record—remained
    intact and strengthened. The ''grit-click'' percussion metaphor evolved naturally
    across versions. The paper thwack, trash bins, buckled sidewalk all preserved.
    The core emotional architecture (routine as safety, grief as avoidance) maintained
    while adding specificity. The final addition of Sarah and the milkweed subplot
    builds organically from existing themes rather than replacing them. Score: 0.88
    (excellent preservation with meaningful expansion).


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. ''Teddy''s routine shown with specific, loving detail'' - SATISFIED (0.95):
    The opening five sentences establish the routine with extraordinary specificity:
    6:05 AM departure, grit-clicking knees, paper thwack timing, trash bin scent,
    buckled sidewalk. The loving detail emerges through the worn shoe heels and the
    phrase ''his feet remembered the hazard''—affection conveyed through embodied
    knowledge.

    2. ''Disruption reveals something Teddy has been avoiding'' - SATISFIED (0.90):
    The construction site forces Teddy off his path. This reveals his avoidance of
    grief, change, and human connection. The reflexive check for Martha''s grocery
    list is particularly strong—a physical manifestation of denial. The alley forces
    confrontation with what he''s been avoiding.

    3. ''Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s'' - SATISFIED (0.95):
    Sarah is introduced with clear intersection: she tends her grandfather''s garden
    corridor while Teddy avoided his wife''s gardening legacy. Both are maintaining/breaking
    chains of memory. The photograph of her grandfather mirrors Teddy''s own loss.

    4. ''Teddy''s late wife present through absence'' - SATISFIED (0.92): Martha appears
    through: the single plate in drying rack, the hollow clock, the unhung grocery
    list, the untended backyard, the milkweed memory, the straw sun hat detail. Her
    absence is palpable and specific, not generic.

    5. ''New path offers something old path couldn''t'' - SATISFIED (0.88): The old
    path offered safety through repetition and avoidance. The new path (the alley,
    the garden, Sarah''s companionship) offers: shared grief, purposeful action, sensory
    engagement (''cool and soft against his palms''), connection without the barrier
    of his kitchen''s emptiness, and forward movement (''simply holding his ground'').


    BEAT EXECUTION (Story Circle):

    - YOU: Teddy in routine (0.90) - Established with precision

    - NEED: Disruption forces confrontation (0.88) - Construction site works, though
    could be slightly more dramatic

    - GO: Teddy enters alley/meets Sarah (0.85) - Functional but somewhat abrupt transition

    - SEARCH: Kneeling in garden, learning about milkweed corridor (0.88) - Strong
    sensory and emotional work

    - FIND: Recognition of Martha''s legacy, realization he''s not checking his watch
    (0.90) - Subtle and earned

    - TAKE: Teddy kneels, engages with earth, breaks the cycle (0.85) - Resolution
    is understated (strength or weakness depending on intent)

    - RETURN: Implied but not explicit (0.75) - The final image suggests return to
    neighborhood but transformed; could be clearer

    - CHANGE: Teddy moves from avoidance to engagement (0.88) - Clear but subtle


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: 0.88

    STRENGTHS: Exceptional sensory specificity (''grit-click,'' ''sour-sweet breath,''
    ''cool and soft against his palms''). Metaphors are earned and recurring (percussion,
    topography, paths). The coffee shop scene reveals character through action and
    hesitation rather than exposition. Sarah''s introduction is natural and her dialogue
    carries thematic weight. The final image (''simply holding his ground'') is resonant
    without being heavy-handed.


    WEAKNESSES: The transition to the alley (''He turned into it'') feels slightly
    mechanical. The phrase ''the silence of the last three years'' lapses into abstraction
    after pages of concrete detail. Sarah''s backstory arrives somewhat quickly—could
    use one more beat of discovery. The resolution, while subtle and earned, might
    leave some readers wanting slightly more explicit transformation.


    OVERALL: This is a well-executed revision that demonstrates strong critique responsiveness.
    The writer identified the core weakness (vague interiority) and systematically
    replaced abstraction with specific, sensory detail. All five constraints are satisfied.
    The prose quality is consistently strong, with particular excellence in the opening
    and closing images. The story earns its emotional beats through action and detail
    rather than telling. The improvement trajectory shows both tightening and meaningful
    expansion—a sign of mature revision practice.'
