  evidence: 'Plan: clear hero''s-journey structure with concrete scenes (anechoic
    chamber, cargo jet, mentor as child prodigy, psychological threshold), so completeness
    and specificity are high. Final output closely follows the plan (adherence 1.0).
    Constraints: all explicit constraints are addressed except one borderline issue
    — the alien signal is described with strongly alien technical details (fractal
    waveforms, golden-ratio intervals) but is also repeatedly labeled as a ''song''/''singing''
    and aligned with human lullaby intervals, which risks anthropomorphizing the signal;
    therefore counted as not fully satisfied (5/6). All four required beats (Call
    to Adventure, Refusal, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing the Threshold) are present
    and well executed. Narrative quality is high: good pacing, tension, and an effective
    surprising human connection (Kapoor humming and Yuki answering).'
