  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on the 'youth_voice' criterion, highlighting
    instances where Zara's internal monologue or descriptive language felt too adult.
    The revisions (V1-V3 and Final) show a clear effort to address this by simplifying
    language and focusing more on Zara's actions and direct dialogue. For example,
    phrases like 'The air was thick with cynicism' were removed or rephrased. The
    final version is much better in this regard, though some adult-like phrasing still
    occasionally slips in (e.g., 'a new spark of hope flickered into life, fueled
    by the belief of a girl who refused to let the world drown in darkness'). The
    'hope_balance' and 'worldbuilding' aspects were largely preserved, as they weren't
    heavily critiqued. The constraint satisfaction improved, particularly with the
    explicit mention of Zara's invention and the mentor's flaw. However, the 'real
    danger' constraint is still a bit weak, as the storm feels more like a plot device
    than a truly perilous, sustained threat.
