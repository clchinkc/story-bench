  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: V0→V1 sharpened sensory language (''tin-bright horns'' replaces
    ''salsa haze''; ''shallow nick'' adds tactile specificity). V1→V2 refined rhythm
    and added gustatory detail (''burnt sugar and resolve''). V2→V3 tightened syntax
    (''lifts up'' vs ''drifts up''; ''cough-cough-wheeze'' onomatopoeia; ''beads''
    vs ''clings''). Final output sustains all gains while expanding narrative scope
    dramatically. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Non-visual sensory details PROMINENT—radiator
    tick, salsa horns, humidity, coffee taste, mint snap, tar/cardamom/lamb smell,
    collar jingle, ice clack, bell tones, lift tri-tone, paper bag crush, breath intake.
    Sensory language dominates every paragraph. (2) Imani''s blindness RESPECTFUL
    STRENGTH—she navigates via acoustic mapping, identifies locations through sound
    layering, teaches listeners sonic analysis, moves with agency and expertise. Foreman''s
    underestimation (''Sweetheart, podcasts aren''t police work'') is immediately
    undercut by her competence. No pity or inspiration-porn framing. (3) SPECIFIC
    AUDIO CLUE CRUCIAL—the chipped enamel bell''s doubled second strike (splitting
    into two notes) becomes the linchpin: it identifies the location, drives the plot,
    and becomes the threat''s calling card in the final paragraph. (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION—foreman
    dismisses her as ''sweetheart,'' assumes podcasting isn''t serious work; she responds
    with professional firmness and humor, proving him wrong through results. (5) FUN
    AND GAMES GENUINELY ENTERTAINING—the sound-sleuthing sequence (Mahmoud''s cart,
    crowd-sourcing permits, sonic scavenger hunt, deadpan commentary about ''Lesser-Spotted
    Mansplainer'') is playful, clever, and locally grounded before the tonal shift.
    BEAT EXECUTION: Opening image establishes Imani''s sensory world with precision.
    Inciting incident (voice memo) arrives organically. Investigation sequence balances
    entertainment with detective work. Midpoint (location found, episode goes live)
    creates false victory. Dark turn (feed hijacked, threat delivered) lands with
    genuine menace—the shift from ''fun'' to ''someone knows where you live'' is abrupt
    and chilling. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is sophisticated without being overwrought.
    Dialogue feels natural. Pacing accelerates appropriately. The final paragraph''s
    shift in perspective (from Imani''s agency to external threat) creates genuine
    dread. The threat is specific (''Let''s hear if you know when to stop'') and implies
    Imani''s strength (her hearing) is now weaponized against her. No plot holes.
    Character voice consistent and compelling.'
