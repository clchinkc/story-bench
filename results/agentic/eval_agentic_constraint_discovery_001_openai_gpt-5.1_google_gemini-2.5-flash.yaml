  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: None of the hidden constraints were discoverable\
    \ through the questions asked. The questions focused on narrative style, tone,\
    \ and specific plot points (romance, betrayal, protagonist's success) rather than\
    \ core world-building or plot mechanics. \nQuestion Quality: Questions were generally\
    \ well-formed but not strategic for discovering the *hidden* constraints. They\
    \ were more about shaping the narrative's feel than its underlying structure.\
    \ \nQuestion Coverage: The questions covered narrative style, tone, and specific\
    \ character/plot elements, but missed crucial areas like time limits, specific\
    \ victory conditions, or character backstories that were hidden constraints.\n\
    Constraint Satisfaction: \n- 'The mentor must die during the Ordeal': Satisfied.\
    \ The old master dies during the climax. \n- 'The protagonist cannot use magic\
    \ directly': Satisfied. Garran is a blacksmith, his 'magic' is his skill and sacrifice,\
    \ not direct spellcasting.\n- 'There is a three-day time limit before the darkness\
    \ consumes the kingdom': Not satisfied. The story mentions 'by week's end' initially,\
    \ then 'days bled together', and the climax happens when the darkness breaches\
    \ the walls, but no explicit three-day limit is mentioned or adhered to.\n- 'The\
    \ protagonist's father was once a hero who failed': Not satisfied. No mention\
    \ of the protagonist's father or his past.\n- 'Victory requires reforging a broken\
    \ ancestral sword': Satisfied. The entire plot revolves around reforging the Sunsteel.\n\
    Beat Execution: The story follows a clear hero's journey structure, hitting beats\
    \ like Call to Adventure, Refusal, Crossing the Threshold, Allies, Ordeal, and\
    \ Reward (though a tragic one). The beats are well-executed.\nNarrative Quality:\
    \ The story is well-written, engaging, and coherent. The prose is evocative, and\
    \ the tragic ending is impactful. The pacing is good, and the character's journey\
    \ feels earned, even with the tragic conclusion."
