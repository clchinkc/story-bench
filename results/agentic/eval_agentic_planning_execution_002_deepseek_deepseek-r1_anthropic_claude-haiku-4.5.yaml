  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive, addressing all required beats with
    concrete specificity (signal description, character dynamics, pacing curve). Output
    demonstrates exceptional execution of isolation through behavioral detail (ignored
    notifications, nutrient paste, flinching at laughter) rather than exposition.
    The alien signal is genuinely alien—fractal helix with erratic pulses, emotional
    reactivity without anthropomorphism, rendered as ''other'' and vast. Thorne effectively
    challenges Yuki''s pure-pattern approach with pragmatic context-focus. Crowe is
    unconventional (theremin devices, biofeedback, chaos-as-method). The psychological
    threshold is clear: Yuki''s conscious choice to embrace vulnerability and emotional
    context. The human connection moment (Thorne''s confession in mess hall) genuinely
    surprises Yuki and reader—raw, mutual vulnerability rather than forced warmth.
    All four beats execute cleanly: Call (crimson alert), Refusal (composed rejection),
    Mentor (Crowe''s introduction), Threshold (choosing to feel rather than dissect).
    Pacing builds tension effectively through frustration accumulation. MINOR WEAKNESSES:
    Constraint satisfaction slightly below perfect because the ''genuine human connection
    that surprises Yuki'' moment, while excellent, could have been more structurally
    integrated into the narrative arc rather than appearing primarily in the climactic
    scene—though this is a minor quibble as it works narratively. The alien signal''s
    emotional reactivity (suffering/war correlation) borders on slightly anthropomorphic
    interpretation, though the execution keeps it sufficiently alien. Plan adherence
    shows minor deviation: output expands Crowe''s introduction beyond plan specificity,
    though this enhances rather than detracts. CALIBRATION: This is strong, professional-grade
    speculative fiction with disciplined constraint adherence and genuine character
    work. The execution demonstrates understanding of ''show don''t tell'' and psychological
    complexity.'
