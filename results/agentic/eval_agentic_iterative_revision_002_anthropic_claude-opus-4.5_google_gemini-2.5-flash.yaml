  evidence: The revisions consistently improved the opening image, adding more sensory
    details and refining the language. The core elements were preserved well. The
    final output satisfies most constraints, though the 'Fun and Games' section could
    be more explicitly entertaining before turning dark. The audio clue is crucial,
    Imani's blindness is portrayed respectfully, and the underestimating character
    is present. The non-visual sensory details are prominent.
