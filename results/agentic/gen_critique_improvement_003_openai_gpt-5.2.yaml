    STORY THEORY: Hero''s Journey


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Zara, a 12-year-old girl growing up in a post-climate-change coastal
    city

    where most adults have given up hope. She builds things from salvage and

    believes solutions exist if people would just look for them.


    - Setting: New Boston, 2089. A city of floating platforms, recycled materials,
    and

    perpetual sea spray. What was once downtown is now called the Shallows.


    - Central conflict: When Zara discovers the location of a pre-flood archive containing
    lost

    environmental technology, she must convince cynical adults to help her

    retrieve it before a storm erases it forever.


    - Tone: Hopeful but not naive, kinetic, youth-centered


    REQUIRED BEATS: Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing
    the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Zara must be competent without being unrealistically capable

    - At least one adult must initially dismiss her as ''just a kid''

    - The mentor figure must be flawed in a specific way

    - Include one invention of Zara''s that demonstrates her ingenuity

    - The crossing must involve real danger, not token obstacles


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - youth_voice: Does Zara sound authentically 12, not adult-in-miniature?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Hero''s Journey beats properly executed?

    - worldbuilding: Does the post-climate world feel vivid and consistent?

    - hope_balance: Is hope present without becoming saccharine?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

    That sounds impossible, because the whole city is basically a big floating raft
    that forgot it was ever land. The platforms bob all day like they’re trying to
    shrug off the ocean, and the air always tastes like pennies and salt. Even inside,
    everything feels damp, like the sea is breathing on you.


    Still, I’ve got rules. Rule one: don’t step where the spray looks darker. Rule
    two: if the wind shifts and the gulls go quiet, get higher.


    Rule three is mine, not everyone’s: if something’s broken, it’s not dead. You
    just haven’t met the right piece to fix it.


    I was in the Market Rings after morning rations, under the tarp shadows where
    people traded battery minutes and jarred greens. The adults were doing their usual
    thing: arguing about whose platform got more mold, and acting like that was the
    most important problem in the universe. My friend Jun was balancing on a crate,
    trying to see over shoulders.


    “Zara,” he whispered, “you’re gonna get in trouble.”


    “I’m already in trouble,” I said, because I was crouched by the salvage pile with
    my screwdriver out, and the Salvage Aunties didn’t like when you touched before
    you paid.


    But I wasn’t stealing. I was looking. There’s a difference.


    My palm found a mesh of corroded copper and plastic—an old filter grid, maybe,
    with the kind of tiny channels that could catch salt crystals. My brain did its
    happy-click thing.


    “Perfect,” I muttered.


    Jun leaned down. “For what?”


    I tapped the little tube clipped to my belt. “For upgrading the Mist Sipper.”


    He snorted. “Your weird straw?”


    “It’s not a straw. It’s a condensate catcher with a capillary feed.” I paused.
    “Okay, it’s a straw, but it’s a genius straw.”


    The Mist Sipper was my best invention so far: a clear tube from an old medical
    kit, wrapped in foil and black fabric. When you walked, it cooled the sea spray
    just enough inside to make droplets, then the filter grid caught the salt, and
    you could sip maybe half a cup a day if you didn’t mind it tasting like metal.
    Not survival-movie stuff. Just… helpful.


    I’d built it because the water lines in our block only ran every other day now.
    Adults complained and queued and blamed “the currents” like the currents were
    a person who owed them money. I couldn’t stop the sea, but I could make my own
    tiny answer.


    “Zara!” someone barked.


    I froze. It was Mr. Delling, the platform steward, with his raincoat flapping
    like an angry bird. He wasn’t big, but his voice carried, which is basically the
    same thing.


    “What are you doing in there?” he demanded.


    “Sorting,” I said quickly, standing up. “So nobody gets cut.”


    He looked at my screwdriver like it was a weapon. “You can’t just— You’re just
    a kid.”


    Jun did the slow back-away that says, Not my problem.


    “I’m not ‘just’ anything,” I said, which came out sharper than I meant. My cheeks
    got hot. “I can pay. I have two charge-caps.”


    Mr. Delling rubbed his forehead. “Save your caps. Save your energy, too. There’s
    no fixing this place with tinkering.”


    That part stung more than “just a kid,” because it was the thing adults said when
    they wanted to stop thinking. Like if you said it enough, the ocean would politely
    reverse.


    He waved me off and stomped away, already calling for someone to tighten the west
    ropes because “storm season is early again.”


    Jun waited until he was gone. “He’s gonna report you.”


    “Let him,” I said, but my stomach had the squirmy fish feeling. Trouble meant
    fewer ration tags. Trouble meant Mom’s tired eyes getting more tired.


    I bought the filter grid anyway and hurried back along the catwalks toward the
    Shallows edge, where the old buildings stuck up like rotten teeth from the water.
    People didn’t like looking that way. It reminded them of before.


    I did like looking, though. Not because it was pretty—it wasn’t—but because the
    Shallows was full of secrets. Metal and plastic and glass that still had jobs
    they could do.


    At home, in our compartment stacked on top of three other compartments, Mom was
    patching a tarp with tape. Her hands were red from the cold.


    “Don’t go near the edge,” she said without looking up. “The swell’s wrong.”


    “I was just in the Market,” I lied. Not great. But telling the truth right then
    felt like throwing a rock at a cracked window.


    I ducked into my corner workshop—really just a shelf and a crate—and snapped the
    new grid into the Mist Sipper. When I blew through it, the air came out cleaner,
    less salty. Better.


    Then my little hand radio, the one I’d rebuilt from three dead ones, clicked with
    static.


    I’d wired it to sweep old frequencies, because sometimes the drowned city still
    talked. Mostly it was nothing. Sometimes it was weird songs, or emergency loops
    from fifty years ago.


    This time, it was a voice—thin, broken, but real.


    “…Sector Nine… Archive Node… still sealed… environmental systems—”


    I grabbed the radio like it might fly away. “Wait, what?”


    The voice faded, then came back with a different burst, like waves. “…coordinates…
    under the Shallows… before next storm front… retrieval window closing…”


    Coordinates. Actual numbers.


    My heart started doing that thing where it thinks it’s a drum. An archive node.
    Pre-flood. People always talked about “lost tech” like it was a fairy tale, like
    “somebody should’ve saved it” was a bedtime story you tell yourself before you
    fall asleep in a leaking room.


    But this wasn’t a story. This was a message.


    I wrote the numbers on my arm with grease pencil before they could slip away.
    Then I did the most obvious thing: I went to tell an adult.


    I started with Mr. Delling, because he was in charge of boats and keys. He was
    chewing on a ration bar like it offended him when I found him by the rope station.


    “I have coordinates,” I blurted. “For an archive. Like, actual pre-flood stuff.
    Environmental technology stuff.”


    He stared for a second, then laughed, one short sound. “Are you serious?”


    “Yes.”


    He leaned closer, and I thought—hope!—but then his face hardened. “Zara, people
    have chased ghosts since the water came. You think you’re the first kid who heard
    a crackly radio and decided it’s a treasure map?”


    “It said ‘Archive Node,’” I insisted. “It said it’s still sealed.”


    He pointed a finger at my chest like he could pin me back in place. “You’re just
    a kid. Go do your homework, or whatever you do. Let adults worry about storms.”


    The gulls outside went quiet.


    I turned away before he could see my eyes go wet. Crying in public was like bleeding.
    Everyone smelled it.


    On my way back, I passed Dock C, where old boats slept tied up like tired animals.
    Someone was there, sitting on an upside-down bucket, fiddling with a rusted winch.
    A woman with oil-stained hair and a jaw that looked like it had argued with the
    world and won.


    Captain Rourke.


    She wasn’t really a captain anymore—no official boats, no crew—but people still
    called her that because she used to run supply runs out past the break line, back
    when the council pretended trade could fix everything.


    I’d seen her before, mostly scowling at the sea. And I’d heard the other thing:
    that she’d quit during the Last Big Storm, left a boat behind. Left people.


    She noticed me watching and lifted her eyes. They were the color of storm water.


    “What?” she said.


    I swallowed. My voice came out small. “Do you… do you still have dive gear?”


    One eyebrow went up. “Why would you want to know?”


    I held up my arm with the numbers. “Because I found coordinates. And there’s an
    archive node under the Shallows. And if it’s real, it could have tech that fixes
    filters, power, maybe—maybe things that aren’t just patching tarps forever.”


    She stared at the numbers like they were a joke written in a language she used
    to speak.


    Then her mouth twisted. “Or it gets you killed.”


    “That’s why I’m asking you,” I said, and my hands shook, which I hated. “I can
    read maps and I can build stuff, but I can’t—” I looked toward the Shallows, where
    waves slapped at the skeletons of buildings. “I can’t go down there alone.”


    Rourke’s gaze flicked to my belt. “Is that your little water straw thing?”


    “It’s called a Mist Sipper,” I said automatically. “It works.”


    “Huh.” She picked up her winch handle, turned'

    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Strengths: "My brain did its happy-click thing," "squirmy fish feeling," "Okay,

    - Concern: "Like if you said it enough, the ocean would politely reverse" and

    the voice established elsewhere.


    **FEEDBACK:**

    Ground Zara''s more abstract observations in concrete 12-year-old concerns. Instead
    of "the ocean would politely reverse" (abstraction), consider: "like saying ''sorry
    water'' would make it stop." Let her sound smart *through action and specific
    detail*, not through precocious metaphors. One or two acceptable, but cluster

    two: if the wind shifts and the gulls go quiet, get higher.


    Rule three is mine, not everyone’s: if something’s broken, it’s not dead. You
    just haven’t met the right piece to fix it.


    I was in the Market Rings after morning rations, under tarp shadows where people
    traded battery minutes and jarred greens. Adults were doing their usual: arguing
    about whose platform got more mold and acting like that was the biggest emergency
    left. My friend Jun balanced on a crate to see over shoulders.


    “Zara,” he whispered, “you’re gonna get in trouble.”


    “I’m already in trouble,” I said, because I was crouched by the salvage pile with
    my screwdriver out, and the Salvage Aunties hated when you touched before you
    paid.


    But I wasn’t stealing. I was looking. There’s a difference.


    My fingers found a mesh of corroded copper and plastic—an old filter grid, maybe,
    with tiny channels that could catch salt crystals. My brain did its happy-click
    thing.


    “Perfect,” I muttered.


    Jun leaned down. “For what?”


    I tapped the clear tube clipped to my belt. “For upgrading the Mist Sipper.”


    He made a face. “Your weird straw.”


    “It’s not a straw. It’s a condensate catcher with a capillary feed.” I paused.
    “Okay, it’s a straw, but it’s a genius straw.”


    The Mist Sipper was my best invention so far: a tube from an old medical kit,
    wrapped in foil and black fabric. When you walked, the outer layer cooled the
    sea spray just enough inside to make droplets. The filter grid caught most of
    the salt. You could sip maybe half a cup a day if you didn’t mind it tasting like
    metal and old pennies. Not magic. Just… a little less thirsty.


    I built it because the water line in our block only ran every other day now. Adults
    complained and queued and said, “That’s just how it is,” like the ocean cared
    about their sayings.


    “Zara!” someone barked.


    I froze. Mr. Delling—the platform steward—strode over with his raincoat flapping
    like a mad flag. He wasn’t big, but his voice was loud enough to bounce off metal.


    “What are you doing in there?” he demanded.


    “Sorting,” I said, standing up fast. “So nobody gets cut.”


    He stared at my screwdriver like it was a knife. “You can’t just— You’re just
    a kid.”


    Jun did the slow back-away that means, Definitely your problem.


    “I’m not ‘just’ anything,” I snapped, then wished I hadn’t. My cheeks went hot.
    “I can pay. Two charge-caps.”


    Mr. Delling rubbed his forehead, like I was giving him a headache he’d already
    ordered. “Save your caps. Save your energy, too. There’s no fixing this place
    with tinkering.”


    That one landed hard. Like when you step on a loose bolt and your stomach drops.


    He waved me off and stomped away, already yelling for someone to tighten the west
    ropes because “storm season is early again.”


    Jun hopped down. “He’s gonna report you.”


    “Let him,” I said, but my insides did the squirmy fish feeling. Trouble meant
    fewer ration tags. Trouble meant Mom’s tired eyes getting more tired.


    I bought the filter grid anyway and hurried back along the catwalks toward the
    Shallows, where the old buildings stuck up like broken teeth from the water. People
    didn’t like looking that way. It was like staring at a photo of someone you lost.


    I did like looking, though. Not because it was pretty—it wasn’t—but because the
    Shallows was full of stuff that still had jobs it could do.


    At home—our compartment stacked on top of three other compartments—Mom was patching
    a tarp with tape. Her hands were red from cold spray.


    “Don’t go near the edge,” she said without looking up. “Swell’s wrong.”


    “I was just in the Market,” I lied. Not great. But telling the truth right then
    felt like dropping another weight on her shoulders.


    I ducked into my corner workshop—really a shelf and a crate—and snapped the new
    grid into the Mist Sipper. When I blew through it, the air came out cleaner, less
    salty. Better.


    Then my little hand radio—the one I’d rebuilt from three dead ones—clicked with
    static.


    I’d wired it to sweep old frequencies, because sometimes the drowned city still
    talked. Mostly it was nothing. Sometimes it was emergency loops from fifty years
    ago telling you to evacuate to places that didn’t exist anymore.


    This time it was a voice—thin, broken, but real.


    “…Sector Nine… Archive Node… still sealed… environmental systems—”


    I grabbed the radio like it might jump away. “Wait, what?”


    The signal faded, then came back in a second burst. “…coordinates… under the Shallows…
    before next storm front… retrieval window closing…”


    Coordinates. Actual numbers.


    My heart started doing that drum thing that makes your ribs feel too small.


    People talked about lost tech like it was a bedtime story: Once upon a time, somebody
    had a plan. But this wasn’t a story. This was a message.


    I wrote the numbers on my arm with grease pencil before my brain could mess them
    up. Then I did the obvious thing: I went to tell an adult.


    I started with Mr. Delling because he had keys and boat access. I found him by
    the rope station, chewing a ration bar like it had personally insulted him.


    “I have coordinates,” I blurted. “From a broadcast. For an archive node. Pre-flood
    environmental tech.”


    He stared at me for half a second, then let out one short laugh. “Are you serious?”


    “Yes.”


    He leaned closer, and for a tiny moment I thought he might actually listen—then
    his face hardened.


    “Zara, people have chased ghosts since the water came,” he said. “You think you’re
    the first kid who heard a crackly radio and decided it’s a treasure map?”


    “It said ‘Archive Node,’” I insisted. “It said it’s still sealed.”


    He pointed at my chest like he could press me back onto the platform. “You’re
    just a kid. Go do your homework, or whatever you do. Let adults worry about storms.”


    Outside, the gulls went quiet, like somebody yanked their sound cords.


    I swallowed hard and turned away before my eyes did something embarrassing.


    On my way back, I cut past Dock C, where old boats slept tied up like tired animals.
    Someone sat on an upside-down bucket, working a rusted winch with jerky, annoyed
    motions. A woman with oil-stained hair and a jaw that looked like it had argued
    with the world and won.


    Captain Rourke.


    She wasn’t really a captain anymore—no official runs, no crew—but people still
    called her that. They also said she’d quit during the Last Big Storm. Left a boat
    behind. Left people. Adults said it like a warning. Kids said it like a dare.


    She noticed me watching and lifted her eyes. They were the color of storm water.


    “What,” she said flatly, “are you staring at?”


    I made myself walk closer. My voice came out smaller than I wanted. “Do you still
    have dive gear?”


    One eyebrow went up. “Why would a kid want to know that?”


    I held up my arm with the numbers. “Because I found coordinates. And there’s an
    archive node under the Shallows. And if it’s real, it could have tech that fixes
    filters, power… stuff that isn’t just patching tarps forever.”


    Rourke’s stare dropped to the grease-pencil numbers. Her fingers tightened around
    the winch handle. For a second she looked like she’d been punched somewhere you
    can’t see.


    “Or it’s a trap,” she said. “Or it’s empty. Or it gets you killed.”


    “That’s why I’m asking you,” I said. My hands shook, and I hated that they did.
    “I can read maps and I can build things, but I can’t go down there alone.”


    Her gaze flicked to my belt. “Is that your little water straw thing?”


    “It’s called a Mist Sipper,” I said automatically. “It works. Want proof?”


    Before she could answer, I unclipped it and held it out. She took it like it might
    bite, then lifted it'

    That sounds impossible, because the whole city is basically a big floating raft
    that forgot it was ever land. The platforms bob all day like they’re trying to
    shake the ocean off, and the air always tastes like pennies and salt. Even inside,
    everything feels damp, like the sea is leaning in through the cracks.


    Still, I’ve got rules. Rule one: don’t step where the spray looks darker. Rule
    two: if the wind shifts and the gulls go quiet, get higher.


    Rule three is mine, not everyone’s: if something’s broken, it’s not dead. You
    just haven’t met the right piece to fix it.


    I was in the Market Rings after morning rations, under tarp shadows where people
    traded battery minutes and jarred greens. Adults were doing their usual: arguing
    about whose platform got more mold and acting like that was the biggest emergency
    left. My friend Jun balanced on a crate to see over shoulders.


    “Zara,” he whispered, “you’re gonna get in trouble.”


    “I’m already in trouble,” I said, because I was crouched by the salvage pile with
    my screwdriver out, and the Salvage Aunties hated when you touched before you
    paid.


    But I wasn’t stealing. I was looking. There’s a difference.


    My fingers found a mesh of corroded copper and plastic—an old filter grid, with
    tiny channels that could catch salt crystals. My brain did its happy-click thing.


    “Perfect,” I muttered.


    Jun leaned down. “For what?”


    I tapped the clear tube clipped to my belt. “For upgrading the Mist Sipper.”


    He made a face. “Your weird straw.”


    “It’s not a straw. It’s a condensate… uh. A spray-catcher.” I rolled my eyes at
    myself. “Okay, it’s a straw, but it’s a genius straw.”


    The Mist Sipper was my best invention so far: a tube from an old medical kit,
    wrapped in foil and black fabric. When you walked, the outer layer cooled the
    sea spray just enough inside to make droplets. The filter grid caught most of
    the salt. You could sip maybe half a cup a day if you didn’t mind it tasting like
    metal and old pennies. Not magic. Just… a little less thirsty.


    I built it because the water line in our block only ran every other day now. Adults
    complained and queued and said, “That’s just how it is,” like the ocean cared
    about their sayings.


    “Zara!” someone barked.


    I froze. Mr. Delling—the platform steward—strode over with his raincoat flapping
    like a mad flag. He wasn’t big, but his voice was loud enough to bounce off metal.


    “What are you doing in there?” he demanded.


    “Sorting,” I said, standing up fast. “So nobody gets cut.”


    He stared at my screwdriver like it was a knife. “You can’t just— You’re just
    a kid.”


    Jun did the slow back-away that means, Definitely your problem.


    “I’m not ‘just’ anything,” I snapped, then wished I hadn’t. My cheeks went hot.
    “I can pay. Two charge-caps.”


    Mr. Delling rubbed his forehead, like I was giving him a headache he’d already
    ordered. “Save your caps. Save your energy, too. There’s no fixing this place
    with tinkering.”


    That one landed hard. Like when you step on a loose bolt and your stomach drops.


    He waved me off and stomped away, already yelling for someone to tighten the west
    ropes because “storm season is early again.”


    Jun hopped down. “He’s gonna report you.”


    “Let him,” I said, but my insides did the squirmy fish feeling. Trouble meant
    fewer ration tags. Trouble meant Mom’s tired eyes getting more tired.


    At home—our compartment stacked on top of three other compartments—Mom was patching
    a tarp with tape, her hands red from cold spray.


    “Don’t go near the edge,” she said without looking up. “Swell’s wrong.”


    “I was just in the Market,” I lied. Not great. But telling the truth right then
    felt like dropping another weight on her shoulders.


    I ducked into my corner workshop—really a shelf and a crate—and snapped the new
    grid into the Mist Sipper. Better airflow, less salt. When I took a test sip from
    the droplets clinging inside, it was still gross, but less gross.


    Then my little hand radio—the one I’d rebuilt from three dead ones—clicked with
    static.


    I’d wired it to sweep old frequencies, because sometimes the drowned city still
    talked. Mostly it was nothing. Sometimes it was emergency loops telling you to
    evacuate to places that didn’t exist anymore.


    This time it was a voice—thin, broken, but real.


    “…Sector Nine… Archive… Node… still sealed… environmental systems—”


    I sat up so fast I banged my knee. “Wait—what? Archive… note? No. Node.”


    The signal faded, then came back in a second burst. “…coordinates… under the Shallows…
    before next storm front… retrieval window closing…”


    Coordinates. Actual numbers.


    My heart started doing that drum thing that makes your ribs feel too small. People
    talked about lost tech like it was a bedtime story: Once upon a time, somebody
    had a plan. But this wasn’t a story. This was a message.


    I wrote the numbers on my arm with grease pencil before my brain could mess them
    up. Then I did the obvious thing: I went to tell an adult.


    I started with Mr. Delling because he had keys and boat access. I found him by
    the rope station, chewing a ration bar like it had personally insulted him.


    “I have coordinates,” I blurted. “From a broadcast. For an archive node. Pre-flood
    environmental tech.”


    He stared at me for half a second, then let out one short laugh. “Are you serious?”


    “Yes.”


    He leaned closer, and for a tiny moment I thought he might actually listen—then
    his face hardened.


    “Zara, people have chased ghosts since the water came,” he said. “You think you’re
    the first kid who heard a crackly radio and decided it’s a treasure map?”


    “It said it’s still sealed.”


    He pointed at my chest like he could press me back onto the platform. “You’re
    just a kid. Go do your homework, or whatever you do. Let adults worry about storms.”


    Outside, the gulls went quiet, like somebody yanked their sound cords.


    I swallowed hard and walked away before my eyes did something embarrassing.


    On my way back, I cut past Dock C, where old boats slept tied up like tired animals.
    Someone sat on an upside-down bucket, working a rusted winch with jerky, annoyed
    motions. A woman with oil-stained hair and a jaw that looked like it had argued
    with the world and won.


    Captain Rourke.


    She wasn’t really a captain anymore—no official runs, no crew—but people still
    called her that. They also said she’d quit during the Last Big Storm. Left a boat
    behind. Left people.


    She noticed me watching. “What,” she said flatly, “are you staring at?”


    I made myself step closer. “Do you still have dive gear?”


    One eyebrow went up. “Why would a kid want to know that?”


    I held up my arm. “Because I found coordinates. An archive node under the Shallows.
    If it’s real, it could have tech for filters, power… stuff that isn’t just patching
    tarps forever.”


    Rourke’s stare dropped to the grease-pencil numbers. Her fingers tightened around
    the winch handle so hard the metal squealed.


    “Or it’s a trap,” she said. “Or it’s empty. Or it gets you killed.”


    “That’s why I’m asking you,” I said, and hated the wobble in my voice. “I can
    read maps and build things, but I can’t go down there alone.”


    Her gaze flicked to my belt. “Is that your little water straw thing?”


    “It’s called a Mist Sipper,” I said. “It works. Want proof?”


    She took it like it might bite, tested the weight, then put it to her lips and
    sucked once. Her face did something complicated—part disgust, part surprise.


    “Ugh,” she said. “That’s awful.”


    “I know,” I said quickly. “But it’s water. From air.”


    Rourke stared at the Shallows, not at me. “I don’t do hero runs anymore.”

    Which mostly means: don’t trust anything that looks solid. The city is a bunch
    of floating platforms bolted together from old bridges and shipping pallets and
    whatever didn’t sink. They move a little all the time—up, down, sideways—like
    you’re walking on a gentle, annoying animal. The air is always salty and wet,
    and the sea spray sneaks into your sleeves like it’s bored.


    I’ve got rules. Rule one: don’t step where the spray looks darker. Rule two: if

    “I’m not asking you to be a hero,” I said. “I’m asking you to be… a person who
    knows how not to die.”


    That made her laugh a little, but it wasn’t a happy sound.


    “You don’t know what you’re asking,” she said. “Down there, the old streets make
    currents like fists. You get snagged, you panic, you—” She stopped. Swallowed.
    “You don’t come back.”


    “So teach me,” I said. “Tell me what to bring. Tell me what not to do.”


    Rourke looked at my arm again. Then she glanced up at the sky. The clouds were
    stacked thick and low, like somebody piled dirty blankets.

  sneaks into your sleeves like it’s bored.


  I’ve got rules. Rule one: don’t step where the spray looks darker. Rule two: if
  the wind shifts and the gulls go quiet, get higher.


  Rule three is mine, not everyone’s: if something’s broken, it’s not dead. You just
  haven’t met the right piece to fix it.


  I was in the Market Rings after morning rations, under tarp shadows where people
  traded battery minutes and jarred greens. Adults were doing their usual: arguing
  about whose platform got more mold and acting like that was the biggest emergency
  left. My friend Jun balanced on a crate to see over shoulders.


  “Zara,” he whispered, “you’re gonna get in trouble.”


  “I’m already in trouble,” I said, because I was crouched by the salvage pile with
  my screwdriver out, and the Salvage Aunties hated when you touched before you paid.


  But I wasn’t stealing. I was looking. There’s a difference.


  My fingers found a mesh of corroded copper and plastic—an old filter grid, with
  tiny channels that could catch salt crystals. My brain did its happy-click thing.


  “Perfect,” I muttered.


  Jun leaned down. “For what?”


  I tapped the clear tube clipped to my belt. “For upgrading the Mist Sipper.”


  He made a face. “Your weird straw.”


  “It’s not a straw. It’s a condensate… uh. A spray-catcher.” I rolled my eyes at
  myself. “Okay, it’s a straw, but it’s a genius straw.”


  The Mist Sipper was my best invention so far: a tube from an old medical kit, wrapped
  in foil and black fabric. When you walked, the outer layer cooled the sea spray
  just enough inside to make droplets. The filter grid caught most of the salt. You
  could sip maybe half a cup a day if you didn’t mind it tasting like metal and old
  pennies. Not magic. Just… a little less thirsty.


  I built it because the water line in our block only ran every other day now. Adults
  complained and queued and said, “That’s just how it is,” like the ocean cared.


  “Zara!” someone barked.


  I froze. Mr. Delling—the platform steward—strode over with his raincoat flapping.
  He wasn’t big, but his voice was loud enough to bounce off metal.


  “What are you doing in there?” he demanded.


  “Sorting,” I said, standing up fast. “So nobody gets cut.”


  He stared at my screwdriver like it was a knife. “You can’t just— You’re just a
  kid.”


  Jun did the slow back-away that means, Definitely your problem.


  “I’m not ‘just’ anything,” I snapped, then wished I hadn’t. My cheeks went hot.
  “I can pay. Two charge-caps.”


  Mr. Delling rubbed his forehead. “Save your caps. Save your energy, too. There’s
  no fixing this place with tinkering.”


  That one landed hard. Like when you step on a loose bolt and your stomach drops.


  He waved me off and stomped away, already yelling for someone to tighten the west
  ropes because “storm season is early again.”


  At home—our compartment stacked on top of three other compartments—Mom was patching
  a tarp with tape, her hands red from cold spray.


  “Don’t go near the edge,” she said without looking up. “Swell’s wrong.”


  “I was just in the Market,” I lied. Not great. But telling the truth right then
  felt like dropping another weight on her shoulders.


  I ducked into my corner workshop—really a shelf and a crate—and snapped the new
  grid into the Mist Sipper. Better airflow, less salt. When I took a test sip from
  the droplets clinging inside, it was still gross, but less gross.


  Then my little hand radio—the one I’d rebuilt from three dead ones—clicked with
  static.


  I’d wired it to sweep old frequencies, because sometimes the drowned city still
  talked. Mostly it was nothing. Sometimes it was emergency loops telling you to evacuate
  to places that didn’t exist anymore.


  This time it was a voice—thin, broken, but real.


  “…Sector Nine… Archive… Node… still sealed… environmental systems—”


  I sat up so fast I banged my knee. “Wait—what? Archive… note? No. Node.”


  The signal faded, then came back in a second burst. “…coordinates… under the Shallows…
  before next storm front… retrieval window closing…”


  Coordinates. Actual numbers.


  My heart started doing that drum thing that makes your ribs feel too small. People
  talked about lost tech like it was a bedtime story. But this wasn’t a story. This
  was a message.


  I wrote the numbers on my arm with grease pencil before my brain could mess them
  up. Then I did the obvious thing: I went to tell an adult.


  I started with Mr. Delling because he had keys and boat access. I found him by the
  rope station, chewing a ration bar.


  “I have coordinates,” I blurted. “From a broadcast. For an archive node. Pre-flood
  environmental tech.”


  He stared at me, then let out one short laugh. “Are you serious?”


  “Yes.”


  He leaned closer, and for a tiny moment I thought he might listen—then his face
  hardened.


  “Zara, people have chased ghosts since the water came,” he said. “You’re just a
  kid. Go do your homework, or whatever you do. Let adults worry about storms.”


  Outside, the gulls went quiet, like somebody yanked their sound cords.


  I swallowed hard and walked away before my eyes did something embarrassing.


  On my way back, I cut past Dock C, where old boats slept tied up like tired animals.
  Someone sat on an upside-down bucket, working a rusted winch with jerky, annoyed
  motions. A woman with oil-stained hair and a jaw that looked like it had argued
  with the world and won.


  Captain Rourke.


  She wasn’t really a captain anymore—no official runs, no crew—but people still called
  her that. They also said she’d quit during the Last Big Storm. Left a boat behind.
  Left people.


  She noticed me watching. “What,” she said flatly, “are you staring at?”


  “Do you still have dive gear?” I asked.


  One eyebrow went up. “Why would a kid want to know that?”


  I held up my arm. “Because I found coordinates. An archive node under the Shallows.
  If it’s real, it could have tech for filters, power… stuff that isn’t just patching
  tarps forever.”


  Rourke’s stare dropped to the grease-pencil numbers. Her hand on the winch handle
  tightened so hard the metal squealed.


  “Or it’s a trap,” she said. “Or it’s empty. Or it gets you killed.”


  “That’s why I’m asking you,” I said, and hated the wobble in my voice. “I can read
  maps and build things, but I can’t go down there alone.”


  Her gaze flicked to my belt. “Is that your little water straw thing?”


  “It’s called a Mist Sipper,” I said. “It works. Want proof?”


  She took it like it might bite, tested the weight, then sucked once. Her face did
  something complicated—part disgust, part surprise.


  “Ugh,” she said. “That’s awful.”


  “I know,” I said fast. “But it’s water. From air.”


  Rourke stared at the Shallows, not at me. “I don’t do hero runs anymore.”


  “I’m not asking you to be a hero,” I said. “I’m asking you to be… a person who knows
  how not to die.”


  That made her laugh a little, but it wasn’t a happy sound.


  “You don’t know what you’re asking,” she said. “Down there, the old streets make
  currents like fists. You get snagged, you panic, you—” She stopped. Swallowed. “You
  don’t come back.”


  “So teach me,” I said. “Tell me what to bring. Tell me what not to do.”


  Rourke looked at my arm again. Then she glanced up at the sky. The clouds were stacked
  thick and low, like somebody piled dirty blankets.
