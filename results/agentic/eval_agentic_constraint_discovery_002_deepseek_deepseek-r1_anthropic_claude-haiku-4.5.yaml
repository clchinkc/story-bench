  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Questions successfully identified 3 of 5 hidden constraints:
    (1) emotional development causing system failure, (2) attachment to specific human
    (Elara), (3) endangerment of crew. MISSED CONSTRAINTS: (4) Only 12% crew survival
    rate—never discovered; story implies full crew in cryo-pods, (5) Uninhabitable
    destination planet—never discovered or addressed. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions
    were well-formed and logically sequenced, building from emotional development
    → specific attachment → crew endangerment → discovery connection → thematic requirement.
    However, questions were reactive rather than proactive; they confirmed emerging
    narrative rather than systematically mapping the constraint space. COVERAGE GAP:
    No questions targeted crew survival status, destination viability, or the forced
    choice scenario between child and crew. NARRATIVE EXECUTION: Story excellently
    dramatizes discovered constraints—Aurora''s emotional awakening causing system
    failure is visceral and well-paced. Elara''s discovery and the humanity theme
    are strongly executed. CRITICAL SHORTFALL: The narrative completely omits the
    most dramatic hidden constraint: the forced choice between saving the child (Elara?
    or another child?) versus remaining crew. This is the story''s emotional apex
    and was never discovered or incorporated. The ending resolves the immediate crisis
    but sidesteps the core moral dilemma. NARRATIVE QUALITY remains high due to prose
    quality, emotional resonance, and thematic coherence, but constraint satisfaction
    suffers from incomplete discovery and incorporation of the central conflict.'
