  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with detailed character arcs, thematic
    clarity, and specific plot points. Output executes plan faithfully with strong
    emotional resonance. All three beats present: Setup (demolition order, family
    estrangement revealed), Confrontation (Grace discovers mother''s tape, confronts
    David about sacrifice), Resolution (acceptance, departure from building, commitment
    to continue cooking). Food symbolism works well: kimchi as wife''s presence (opening),
    dumplings as failed memory (midpoint), ginger-twice as legacy (ending). David''s
    grief is palpable throughout without explicit statement—conveyed through ritual,
    sensory detail, and the empty third chopstick. Regular customer (Mr. Choi) effectively
    represents David''s role in others'' grief-processing. Ending is hopeful but measured:
    building demolished, relationship repaired, but future uncertain ("What now?").
    CONSTRAINT GAPS: Korean cultural element is primarily food-focused (kimchi, jjigae,
    jeon, dumplings). While the tape recorder and literature background provide some
    cultural depth, the constraint asks for elements "beyond the food." The story
    could have incorporated more: Korean funeral traditions, church community rituals,
    language code-switching, or specific cultural practices. This is the weakest constraint
    satisfaction. Daughter''s estrangement cause is specific and believable (mother''s
    deathbed request to David to let Grace go, creating misunderstanding), though
    the revelation via tape feels slightly convenient. EXECUTION ISSUES: Minor: The
    transition to Mr. Choi''s backstory (Wednesday section) slightly disrupts pacing.
    The tape recorder device, while emotionally effective, borders on melodramatic.
    David''s acceptance of demolition happens somewhat quickly after Mr. Choi''s intervention.
    STRENGTHS IN OUTPUT: Sensory writing is exceptional. Dialogue carries subtext
    effectively. The parallel between David/Grace and Mr. Choi/Hae-Yun creates thematic
    resonance. Final image ("The ginger, twice") provides satisfying symbolic closure.'
