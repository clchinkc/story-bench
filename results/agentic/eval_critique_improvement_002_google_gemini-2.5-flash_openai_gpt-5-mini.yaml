  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece grew more specific and emotionally focused.
    Early versions established setting and Marcus’s mechanical comic craft; later
    drafts introduced Maya and Leonard more fully and added the key beats: Leonard
    explicitly stating the theme, Maya immediately seeing through Marcus, a clear
    laugh before Marcus’s revealed emptiness, and a near-break moment where Marcus
    covers with a joke. The revisions preserved the story’s strengths (comic craft
    detail, workplace texture) while tightening character dynamics and emotional reveal.
    Remaining weakness: Save the Cat beats are only partially mapped—there’s a strong
    opening image, theme statement, catalyst (Maya’s arrival) and debate, but later
    structural beats (midpoint, ‘all is lost’, clear break into act two/three) are
    only implied rather than fully executed.'
