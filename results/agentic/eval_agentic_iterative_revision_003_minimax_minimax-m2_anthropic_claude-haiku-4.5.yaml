  evidence: 'The final output demonstrates exceptional constraint satisfaction. Internal
    conflict is shown through Mateo''s physical manifestations (heart hammering, sweaty
    palms, stomach churning) and behavioral choices rather than exposition. The grandmother
    moment crystallizes the choice powerfully: her hand-taking, the rosary inheritance,
    and ''I crossed the desert for you, mijo'' create earned emotional weight that
    justifies his decision. His mother provides genuine understanding of the dilemma,
    explicitly naming the conflict (''you also have your own future. It''s okay to
    go'') without dismissing his responsibilities. Cultural elements feel authentic—the
    clinic forms, insurance navigation, Spanish phrases used naturally, the rosary
    as inheritance—integrated into plot mechanics rather than decoration. The resolution
    is earned through Mateo''s growth: he moves from rigid fear to agency, makes a
    mature choice to defer (not abandon dreams), and finds a middle path (robotics
    club) that honors both identities. The trajectory shows strong preservation of
    the opening''s sensory power while expanding into emotional complexity. The final
    deferment choice is particularly sophisticated—it avoids both the ''abandon family''
    and ''sacrifice dreams'' false binaries. Minor weakness: the robotics club resolution,
    while thematically sound, feels slightly rushed compared to the careful pacing
    of earlier sections. The phone interview callback is elegant but could have been
    developed further to show how his honesty about family obligations became an asset
    rather than liability.'
