  evidence: 'VERSION 0 establishes setting and conflict premise but remains surface-level
    and incomplete. VERSION 1-2 show identical truncation, suggesting iterative refinement
    in progress. FINAL OUTPUT demonstrates exceptional execution across all dimensions:


    1. INTERNAL CONFLICT (SHOWN, NOT TOLD): Mateo''s conflict manifests through physical
    tension (trembling hands, throat tight, muscle memory), contradictory actions
    (forcing smiles while lying), and internal monologue revealing the fracture (''I
    want to shout... I don''t want to carry it all!''). The conflict is embodied,
    not narrated.


    2. CRYSTALLIZING MOMENT WITH GRANDMOTHER: The discovery of the hidden flyer is
    the precise pivot point. Abuela''s ''Te veo'' (I see you) followed by ''Vete''
    (Go) is earned through her recognition of his sacrifice and her explicit permission
    to prioritize himself. This moment transforms the conflict from paralyzing to
    actionable.


    3. ADULT UNDERSTANDING: Mr. Alvarez demonstrates genuine comprehension through
    two key moments: ''You can''t pour from an empty cup'' (acknowledging unsustainability)
    and ''You don''t owe me your life either'' (mirroring Abuela''s wisdom). His patience
    and knowing smile suggest he recognizes Mateo''s dilemma without judgment.


    4. AUTHENTIC CULTURAL ELEMENTS: Spanish phrases (''¿Estás bien, mijito?'', ''Te
    veo'', ''Vete'', ''tu persona'') are integrated organically into dialogue and
    thought, not deployed performatively. The cultural specificity (translator role
    since age 12, laundry detergent-raw hands, creosote dust, bus schedules) grounds
    the narrative in lived experience rather than stereotype.


    5. EARNED RESOLUTION: Mateo''s growth is demonstrated through concrete action
    (requesting time off with clarity) and internal shift (flyer transforms from secret
    shame to ''promise''). The resolution doesn''t erase his responsibilities but
    reframes his relationship to them—he can be dutiful AND pursue his own life. The
    final line (''he was choosing'') confirms agency earned through the narrative
    arc.


    BEAT EXECUTION: All required narrative beats present and properly sequenced—inciting
    incident (deadline pressure), rising tension (hidden conflict), revelation (grandmother
    discovers flyer), climactic understanding (Abuela''s permission), and resolution
    (Mateo claims his choice). The pacing accelerates appropriately toward the turning
    point.


    QUALITY TRAJECTORY: Versions 0-2 show incremental strengthening of specificity
    and emotional texture. Final version achieves synthesis: tighter prose, deeper
    interiority, crystallized thematic clarity, and earned emotional payoff. The revision
    process successfully moved from competent setup to exceptional execution.'
