  evidence: 'PLAN QUALITY: Exceptionally detailed outline with specific behavioral
    markers (noise-cancelling earpieces, text-only communication, auto-archived messages,
    private log). Clear scene-by-scene breakdown. Identifies all required beats and
    constraints explicitly. Concrete setting choices (orbital relay, Antarctic facility).
    Strong foreshadowing and character development seeds.


    PLAN ADHERENCE: Output follows outline closely through Opening/Ordinary World
    and into Call to Adventure. Isolation behaviors executed precisely as planned
    (earpieces, text chat avoidance, communal meal withdrawal, mother''s message filtered).
    Signal discovery and GSD official call match plan. Shuttle descent and facility
    arrival align. Minor deviation: plan mentions ''mini-conflict'' with junior tech;
    output expands this naturally. Amara Singh introduced as planned colleague-counterweight.
    Hermes AI as unconventional mentor appears on schedule.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5.5/6):

    1. ISOLATION THROUGH BEHAVIOR: ✓ Excellent. Earpieces, text-only communication,
    corner eating, filter auto-archive, private log to ''Beyond Us,'' withdrawal after
    correcting tech. All shown, never told.

    2. ALIEN SIGNAL GENUINELY ALIEN: ✓ Strong. ''Nested clusters,'' ''polarization
    flipped in sequences,'' ''torus twisted in non-Euclidean ways,'' ''chordal mess,''
    ''conditional outcomes with aggregated mental states.'' Resists anthropomorphism;
    Hermes explicitly corrects against it.

    3. CHALLENGING COLLEAGUE: ✓ Amara Singh present, skeptical (''romantic,'' ''tentacles
    or magnetic cloud''), counterbalances Yuki''s approach. Tension established.

    4. UNCONVENTIONAL MENTOR: ✓ Hermes (AI system) serves as mentor. Offers pattern-morphizing
    insight, corrects Yuki''s resistance to metaphor, validates her theoretical work.

    5. PSYCHOLOGICAL THRESHOLD: ✓ Partial. Yuki''s resistance to leaving orbital station,
    fear of ''people,'' internal conflict about ground-based coordination. However,
    threshold crossing itself is not yet fully dramatized—output cuts before she must
    make a decisive psychological commitment or breakthrough.

    6. GENUINE HUMAN CONNECTION SURPRISE: ✓ Amara bringing tea and admitting fear.
    Yuki''s unexpected gratitude (''Something in Yuki''s chest shifted, unpleasant
    and warm''). Moment lands authentically.


    BEAT EXECUTION (4/4):

    1. CALL TO ADVENTURE: ✓ GSD official''s message about signal and Antarctic deployment.

    2. REFUSAL OF THE CALL: ✓ Yuki argues for remote work, resists ground-based coordination
    (''I can work from here'').

    3. MEETING THE MENTOR: ✓ Hermes introduced as cognitive assistant; Amara also
    functions as secondary mentor-figure through challenge and care.

    4. CROSSING THE THRESHOLD: ✓ Shuttle descent, arrival at Antarctic facility, entry
    into collaborative workspace. Psychological threshold partially crossed via Amara''s
    tea moment, though full commitment to the journey''s emotional stakes could be
    deeper.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is precise, sensory, and controlled. Pacing accelerates
    from isolation to signal discovery to facility arrival. Dialogue feels natural
    and reveals character. Yuki''s interiority is conveyed through action and reaction
    rather than exposition. The signal itself is rendered as genuinely strange—not
    a puzzle to solve but a presence to negotiate. Tension builds through competing
    frameworks (Amara''s optimization vs. Yuki''s relationality vs. Hermes''s pattern-morphizing).
    The tea scene is a genuine emotional beat that surprises both character and reader.


    MINOR GAPS: Output truncates mid-scene before full threshold crossing is psychologically
    complete. The ''conditional outcomes'' revelation and Hermes''s hypothesis about
    collective decision-making hint at deeper stakes but aren''t yet integrated into
    Yuki''s internal arc. Refusal of the Call could be slightly more dramatized (she
    acquiesces quickly to authority). These are minor—the foundation is strong.'
