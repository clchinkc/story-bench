  evidence: The questions asked did not lead to the discovery of any of the hidden
    constraints. The questions were too general and did not probe into the specific,
    impactful constraints. For example, asking if the darkness is supernatural or
    caused by a rival kingdom doesn't help discover the 'mentor must die' or 'no direct
    magic' constraints. The output story does not incorporate any of the hidden constraints.
    The beats are present (Call to Adventure, Crossing the Threshold, Ordeal) but
    the Ordeal is very weak and lacks significant impact or resolution. The narrative
    is coherent but lacks depth due to the absence of the hidden constraints.
