  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-2 appear incomplete (truncated at identical
    points), making direct comparison impossible. Version 3 introduces narrative momentum
    with ''Just last week...'' and expands scope. Final output substantially develops
    the story with full arc. Quality improvement is evident from fragment to complete
    narrative, though we cannot assess intermediate revision quality due to truncation.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. ✓ Elena''s competence shown first (ventilator shortage, strategic prowess,
    organized office) - SATISFIED

    2. ✓ Friendship feels earned (gradual connection through Mrs. Gable, shared moment
    with Dr. Sharma, follow-up interactions) - SATISFIED

    3. ✓ Transformation is internal (she still arrives early, leaves late, spreadsheets
    remain impeccable; only her internal experience and small behavioral additions
    change) - SATISFIED

    4. ✓ Specific medical detail serves story (acute respiratory distress, oxygen
    saturation monitoring, double-shifts during flu surge) - SATISFIED

    5. ✗ Ambiguity about true change is WEAK - The ending leans toward confirmation
    of change (''faint smile,'' ''genuine chat,'' ''different, more human note'').
    While not explicitly stating permanent transformation, the narrative arc suggests
    genuine internal shift rather than maintaining genuine ambiguity about whether
    this will persist. The final line ''occasionally, she heard a different, more
    human note'' suggests sustained change rather than uncertain change.


    BEAT EXECUTION:

    - Competence establishment: Strong (3-4 specific examples)

    - Flaw introduction: Adequate (hollow silence, suppressed empathy)

    - Catalyst moment: Well-executed (Mrs. Gable''s request)

    - Friendship development: Good (hand-holding, story-sharing, Dr. Sharma connection)

    - Internal transformation: Solid (garden memory, warmth, resonance)

    - Ambiguous ending: Moderate (leans toward confirmation rather than true ambiguity)


    NARRATIVE QUALITY STRENGTHS:

    - Lyrical prose with consistent metaphor (phantom, hum, melody)

    - Sensory details (fluorescent hum, damp earth, oxygen saturation monitor)

    - Character voice authentic to hospital administrator

    - Pacing effective from efficiency to vulnerability

    - Medical authenticity credible


    NARRATIVE QUALITY WEAKNESSES:

    - Final section slightly tells rather than shows (''For the first time in years,
    Elena felt a profound warmth'')

    - Ambiguity constraint underdelivered

    - Could strengthen uncertainty about sustainability of change

    - ''Nascent spark'' somewhat undermines ambiguity by suggesting genuine connection
    established'
