  evidence: The initial versions (0-3) were identical, showing no iterative improvement
    or responsiveness to feedback. The final output, however, is a complete story
    that addresses most of the constraints. The narrative quality is strong, with
    vivid descriptions and authentic cultural elements. Mateo's internal conflict
    is shown through his actions and thoughts, and the grandmother's moment is impactful.
    Mr. Alvarez genuinely understands Mateo's dilemma. The resolution feels earned.
    The only constraint not fully met is the lack of iterative revisions in the provided
    trajectory, as versions 0-3 are identical. However, the final output itself is
    a significant improvement over the initial snippets.
