  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0-2 appear truncated/incomplete, making direct comparison
    difficult. Version 3 introduces the full narrative arc. The final output substantially
    expands the story with meaningful character development, dialogue, and thematic
    depth. Quality improvement is evident in the final version''s sophistication,
    though the revision process itself is opaque.


    CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:

    1. COMPETENCE BEFORE FLAW (0.95/1.0): Excellently executed. Opening establishes
    Elena''s mastery—mechanical precision, early arrival, catching pharmacy errors,
    confident intubation technique (18-gauge basilic vein placement). Her competence
    is undeniable before her isolation/emotional distance emerges as the flaw.


    2. GENUINE FRIENDSHIP (0.9/1.0): Well-earned. Marcus initiates vulnerability (grandmother
    story, dead father), Elena responds with presence rather than solutions. The progression
    from professional interaction to stolen coffee breaks feels organic. Minor weakness:
    limited dialogue/banter that might deepen intimacy further.


    3. INTERNAL TRANSFORMATION (0.95/1.0): Masterfully handled. Elena''s shift is
    psychological—awareness of loneliness, capacity for silence/presence, willingness
    to ignore pager—not external. She doesn''t change jobs, appearance, or circumstances.
    The trembling hands signal internal conflict.


    4. SPECIFIC MEDICAL DETAIL (1.0/1.0): Perfect execution. The 18-gauge basilic
    vein intubation is anatomically precise, serves characterization (Elena''s precision),
    and grounds the story in authentic medical practice. The capnography confirmation
    adds credibility.


    5. AMBIGUOUS ENDING (0.8/1.0): Strong but slightly weighted. The final paragraph
    explicitly questions whether change occurred ("couldn''t tell if those thirteen
    minutes meant something had shifted"), which satisfies ambiguity. However, the
    ending leans slightly toward "she reverts to old patterns" rather than maintaining
    true equipoise. The phrase "the hospital always won eventually" suggests determinism
    that slightly tips the scale.


    BEAT EXECUTION:

    - Competence display: ✓ (strong)

    - Flaw introduction: ✓ (subtle, effective)

    - Catalyst moment: ✓ (Marcus''s vulnerability)

    - Friendship development: ✓ (earned through time)

    - Transformation moment: ✓ (silencing pager)

    - Ambiguous resolution: ✓ (present but slightly resolved)


    NARRATIVE QUALITY STRENGTHS:

    - Precise, economical prose ("clean as arithmetic")

    - Effective sensory details (trembling hands, 3:47 AM timestamp)

    - Strong voice consistency

    - Thematic coherence (precision vs. presence, metrics vs. meaning)

    - Dialogue that reveals character


    NARRATIVE QUALITY WEAKNESSES:

    - Limited scene variety (mostly hospital/break room)

    - Marcus remains somewhat archetypal (vulnerable resident)

    - Could benefit from one more specific moment showing Elena''s internal resistance

    - The ending, while ambiguous, doesn''t quite achieve the "both true, neither
    resolved" tension it claims


    FEEDBACK RESPONSIVENESS: The final output addresses all stated constraints intentionally.
    The revision process shows awareness of requirements, though intermediate versions
    are incomplete, making it difficult to assess iterative refinement quality.'
error: null
