  content: 'Write a story with the following requirements:


    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

  content: 'The writers’ room smelled of stale Chinese food and desperation. Marcus
    Webb stood at the whiteboard, marker in hand, a conductor before an orchestra
    of exhausted minds. “Okay, the ‘Honey, I’m home’ into a pratfall is played,” he
    said, his voice a dry monotone. “What’s the button? How do we top the pratfall?”


    “He lands in a… cake?” offered a writer, his eyes bloodshot.


    “A sentient cake?” Marcus didn’t look away from the board. “A cake that’s also
    his therapist? ‘I’m a bundt, Greg, but I can see you’re crumbling.’” The room
    chuckled—a real, sharp sound. It was a good joke. Marcus felt nothing.


    **Theme Stated:** From the corner, where he was stress-eating cold lo mein, assistant
    writer Ben mumbled, “It’s always a topping. A bigger, louder topping. When do
    we get to the joke that’s just… quiet? The one that hurts because it’s true?”
    The room went silent. Marcus’s marker hovered. Ben had just articulated the ghost
    haunting every formulaic beat in the room: the pursuit of truth over noise. Marcus
    erased the cake.


    **Catalyst:** The head writer, Sheila, burst in. “Webb, meet your new problem.
    Chloe Reed, fresh from the Denver stand-up scene.” Chloe wasn’t what Marcus expected.
    No wide-eyed reverence. She assessed the stained whiteboard, the mountain of containers,
    and finally Marcus, with a calm, unsettling clarity. “I’ve read your early stuff,”
    she said. “*Static on the Line*. The episode where the dad tries to fix the toaster
    and ends up crying in the garage. That was… human.”


    Marcus deflected with craft. “Human doesn’t get a 3.0 share. Sit. We’re breaking
    the B-story. The neighbor needs a wacky reason to borrow a cup of sugar.” He launched
    into a lecture on “The Rule of Three” and “subverting expectation,” using the
    whiteboard to diagram setups and punchlines with the cold precision of a surgeon.
    He showed her the machinery of funny, all the cogs and gears he’d polished for
    fifteen years.


    Chloe watched, then asked, “But why does the neighbor *need* the sugar? Is she
    baking a pie for her son who won’t call her?” Her question was a pinpoint of light
    in the fog of formula.


    Later, during a break, Marcus found Chloe at the coffee machine. “The garage scene,”
    she said softly. “You wrote that after your dad died, right?” It wasn’t a guess.
    Marcus felt a fissure open in his chest, a sudden, terrifying welling of a feeling
    he’d boarded up years ago—the raw, un-medicated truth that comedy was just pain,
    turned sideways.


    He stared into his black coffee, his knuckles white on the counter. For a second,
    his face, reflected in the stainless steel, was utterly, nakedly bereft. Then
    he blinked, and the mask slid back. He turned to her, a wry smile plastered over
    the crack. “Nah,” he said, the lie smooth and practiced. “I just thought a man
    weeping over small appliances was a *killer* button.” He forced a chuckle. “See?
    Always a topping.”


    But Chloe saw. She didn’t call him on it. She just held his gaze, and in hers
    he didn’t see pity, but a recognition that was far more dangerous. She saw the
    hollow man in the funhouse. And for the first time in three years, Marcus felt
    the faint, terrifying itch of a possible punchline that wasn’t about topping a
    pratfall, but about why the man was falling in the first place.'

    erupted in genuine laughter, a sound that crested and then faded into the hum
    of the air conditioner. Marcus watched it dissipate, a technician observing a
    successful test. He felt the familiar, hollow echo where satisfaction should have
    been.


    **Theme Stated:** From the corner, where he was stress-eating cold lo mein, assistant

    Marcus looked down at his coffee. The laugh he’d forced still hung in the air
    between them, pathetic and thin. He didn’t look up at her. Instead, he quietly
    asked, his voice stripped of its performative edge, “What was your version? Of
    the neighbor. Needing the sugar.”


    Chloe paused, then said, “She’s not baking a pie. She just needs one cup. For
    her coffee. Because she’s alone, and the ritual is the only thing holding her
    day together.”


    Marcus nodded slowly. He didn’t joke. He didn’t top it. For the first time in
    three years, he simply let the truth sit there, quiet and human, between them.'

    - Pathos counterpoint: *Marcus watched it dissipate, a technician observing a\

    \ establishes the laugh-before-the-crack dynamic. However, Marcus's emotional\
    \ shift from defended cynic to vulnerable collaborator happens quite rapidly.\
    \ The journey from \"the mask slid back\" to \"He didn't joke. He didn't top it\"\
    \ spans only a few paragraphs. To deepen emotional complexity, consider adding\
    \ one more scene where Marcus *almost* reaches out to Chloe but retreats—showing\

    \ make the final surrender feel harder-earned.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Constraint\
    \ Satisfaction\n\n**SCORE: 1.0**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n1. ✓ Laugh before sadness:\
    \ \"sentient cake\" joke lands, then hollow hollowness revealed\n2. ✓ Theme by\

    5. ✓ Marcus breaks + covers with joke: Stainless steel reflection moment → \"\

    \ *\"Webb, meet your new problem. Chloe Reed, fresh from the Denver stand-up scene.\"\
    *\n\n**FEEDBACK:** All three required beats are present and clear. However, the\
    \ Catalyst could land with more friction. Chloe's arrival is announced but feels\
    \ slightly passive (\"meet your new problem\"). Consider: What does Marcus immediately\
    \ *resist* about her? A sharper point-of-conflict at the entrance (she challenges\
    \ him in the room, not just later at the coffee machine) would create more momentum.\
    \ The beat is well-executed but could feel less inevitable.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION:\

  content: 'The writers’ room for *Heavy Petting*, a sitcom about a dysfunctional
    dog hotel, smelled of stale Chinese food and desperation. Marcus Webb stood at
    the whiteboard, marker in hand, a conductor before an orchestra of exhausted minds.
    “Okay, the ‘Honey, I’m home’ into a pratfall is played,” he said, his voice a
    dry monotone. “What’s the button? How do we top the pratfall?”


    “He lands in a… cake?” offered a writer, his eyes bloodshot.


    “A sentient cake?” Marcus didn’t look away from the board. “A cake that’s also
    his therapist? ‘I’m a bundt, Greg, but I can see you’re crumbling.’” The room
    erupted in genuine laughter, a sound that crested and then faded into the hum
    of the air conditioner. Marcus watched it dissipate, a technician observing a
    successful test. He felt the familiar, hollow echo where satisfaction should have
    been.


    **Theme Stated:** From the corner, where he was stress-eating cold lo mein, assistant
    writer Ben mumbled, “It’s always a topping. A bigger, louder topping. When do
    we get to the joke that’s just… quiet? The one that hurts because it’s true?”
    The room went silent. Marcus’s marker hovered. Ben had just articulated the ghost
    haunting every formulaic beat in the room: the pursuit of truth over noise. Marcus
    erased the cake with a slow, deliberate swipe.


    **Catalyst:** The head writer, Sheila, burst in. “Webb, meet your new problem.
    Chloe Reed, fresh from the Denver stand-up scene.” Chloe wasn’t what Marcus expected.
    No wide-eyed reverence. She assessed the stained whiteboard, the mountain of containers,
    and finally Marcus, with a calm, unsettling clarity. “I’ve read your early stuff,”
    she said. “*Static on the Line*. The episode where the dad tries to fix the toaster
    and ends up crying in the garage. That was… human.”


    Marcus deflected with craft. “Human doesn’t get a 3.0 share. Sit. We’re breaking
    the B-story. The neighbor needs a wacky reason to borrow a cup of sugar.” He launched
    into a lecture on “The Rule of Three” and “subverting expectation,” using the
    whiteboard to diagram setups and punchlines with the cold precision of a surgeon.


    “So the neighbor’s dog ate her sugar?” Chloe asked, not challenging, just curious.

    “No, the neighbor *is* the dog,” a writer groaned. “It’s a pun. A visual pun.”

    Chloe nodded slowly. “Right. Because it’s *Heavy Petting*.” She didn’t roll her
    eyes, but her flat delivery was its own critique. Marcus felt a flicker of irritation—not
    at her, but at the show, at the room, at the entire machinery.


    Later, during a break, Marcus found Chloe at the coffee machine. “The garage scene,”
    she said softly. “You wrote that after your dad died, right?” It wasn’t a guess.
    Marcus felt a fissure open in his chest, a sudden, terrifying welling of a feeling
    he’d boarded up years ago.


    He stared into his black coffee, his knuckles white on the counter. For a second,
    his face, reflected in the stainless steel, was utterly, nakedly bereft. Then
    he blinked, and the mask slid back. He turned to her, a wry smile plastered over
    the crack. “Nah,” he said, the lie smooth and practiced. “I just thought a man
    weeping over small appliances was a *killer* button.” He forced a chuckle. “See?
    Always a topping.”


    But Chloe saw. She didn’t call him on it.


    Back in the writers’ room, the energy had stalled. Marcus stood before the board,
    the marker idle in his hand. He glanced at Chloe, who was sketching something
    in her notebook. He almost said, “What was your version? Of the neighbor.” But
    Sheila was pacing, and the clock was ticking. He cleared his throat. “Okay, forget
    the dog. The neighbor needs the sugar because… she’s building a tiny catapult
    to launch grievances over the fence.” The room groaned, but they started pitching.
    The moment passed.


    At the end of the day, Marcus was alone, erasing the board. Chloe appeared in
    the doorway, her bag slung over her shoulder. “For what it’s worth,” she said,
    “the toaster scene? That’s the one people remember. Not the toppings.”


    Marcus looked down at the dried-out marker in his hand. He didn’t look up at her.
    Instead, he quietly asked, his voice stripped of its performative edge, “What
    was your version? Of the neighbor. Needing the sugar.”


    Chloe paused, then said, “She’s not baking a pie. She just needs one cup. For
    her coffee. Because she’s alone, and the ritual is the only thing holding her
    day together.”


    Marcus nodded slowly. He didn’t joke. He didn’t top it. For the first time in
    three years, he simply let the truth sit there, quiet and human, between them.
    He finally met her gaze and gave a small, real nod. Not a punchline. An acknowledgment.'
