  evidence: Questions successfully uncovered that the love interest was from the protagonist's
    past, that they begin in conflict (enemies-to-lovers), that they are forced to
    collaborate for the festival, and that the bookshop must be saved from foreclosure—hence
    4/5 discoverable. The question set included one irrelevant item (selling property)
    and missed probing family/health and the former-fiancé-as-mayor facts, so coverage
    was incomplete. The story incorporates the discovered constraints well (left town
    20 years ago/second chance, enemies-to-lovers arc, forced co-hosting, foreclosure
    and festival-as-last-chance) but omits the mother's dementia and the detail that
    the former fiancé is the town mayor and unmarried, yielding 3/5 hidden constraints
    satisfied. Beats (reunion, conflict, forced cooperation, crisis with power outage,
    candlelit save, reconciliation) are well executed, and the prose is coherent and
    engaging.
