  evidence: 'No questions were asked, so discovery metrics are zero. Of five hidden
    constraints, two are clearly incorporated: (4) the bookshop faces foreclosure
    and must be saved, and (5) the autumn festival in two weeks is the last chance.
    The protagonist''s 20-year absence is present but the specific ''broken engagement''
    detail is not made explicit, so constraint (1) is only partially matched. Constraints
    (2) (former fiance is now the mayor) and (3) (returned because mother has early-stage
    dementia) are missing. Beats—forced collaboration, escalating conflict, crisis
    (power outage), creative solution, reconciliation/kiss—are well executed, though
    some hidden motivations/beats are absent.'
