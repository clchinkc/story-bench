  evidence: All 5 constraints were discoverable through the questions. The questions
    were generally strategic and well-formed, though some could have been more open-ended
    to allow for broader discovery. The questions covered the AI's emotional development,
    its secrecy, the mission risk, and the catalyst for grief. The story successfully
    incorporated the AI's emotional development, its secrecy from the crew, the mission
    risk, and the grief catalyst (confidant's death). The narrative is engaging and
    coherent, with a strong emotional core. The only constraint not explicitly addressed
    is the AI's attachment to a child, as the confidant is an adult. However, the
    AI's general empathy for humans is well-established.
