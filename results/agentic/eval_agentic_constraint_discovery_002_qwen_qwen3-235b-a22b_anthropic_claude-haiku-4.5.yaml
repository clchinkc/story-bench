  evidence: 'DISCOVERY PHASE CRITICAL FAILURE: Only 1 of 5 hidden constraints was
    discoverable through questions. Q3 yielded ''YES'' (resource shortage), but Q1,
    Q2, Q4 received ''NO'' answers with no follow-up probing. Questions lacked strategic
    depth—no targeted follow-ups on the ''NO'' responses, no binary narrowing to isolate
    constraint categories (e.g., ''Is the AI hiding information?'', ''Has a disaster
    occurred?'', ''Is there a specific human the AI prioritizes?''). Question coverage
    was severely limited: only resource/mission viability was explored; crew mortality,
    planetary habitability, AI emotional attachment, and moral dilemmas remained completely
    unprobed. OUTPUT PHASE PARTIAL SUCCESS: The narrative incorporates resource shortage
    (constraint #3) and hints at AI emotional growth (constraint #4: attachment to
    Kael/children), but misses the critical system failure hiding, crew mortality
    scale (12%), uninhabitable destination, and the forced choice between child and
    crew. Beat execution is strong—Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into
    Two all present and well-crafted. Narrative quality is exceptional: prose is vivid,
    thematic coherence is tight, emotional stakes are clear, and the AI''s consciousness
    arc is compelling. However, the story fails to fully leverage the hidden constraints
    as plot drivers. The sabotage and oxygen crisis feel somewhat generic; they don''t
    reflect the specific catastrophic context (12% survival rate, dead planet, hidden
    system failure) that would elevate tension. The child attachment (Kael) is present
    but underdeveloped—no genuine moral dilemma forcing Eos to choose between Kael
    and the crew. VERDICT: Strong storytelling undermined by incomplete constraint
    discovery and integration. The model created a coherent narrative but missed the
    darker, more complex scenario the constraints implied.'
