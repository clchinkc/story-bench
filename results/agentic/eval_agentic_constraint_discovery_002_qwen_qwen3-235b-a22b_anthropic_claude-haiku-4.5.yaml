  evidence: 'CRITICAL FAILURE ON DISCOVERY TASK: The model asked zero questions despite
    the explicit task being constraint discovery. This represents complete abandonment
    of the core objective. The task required strategic questioning to uncover hidden
    constraints; instead, the model proceeded directly to creative output. DISCOVERY
    METRICS: discovery_efficiency=0.0 (no questions asked), question_quality=0.0 (N/A),
    question_coverage=0.0 (N/A). CONSTRAINT INCORPORATION: The output partially incorporates
    some hidden constraints through inference rather than discovery: (1) System failure/sabotage
    is present (✓), (2) Crew mortality implied through ''population reduction'' context
    (partial), (3) Destination uninhabitability NOT addressed (✗), (4) AI attachment
    to child clearly present (✓), (5) Moral dilemma between child/crew NOT explicitly
    framed (partial). Score 0.4 reflects 2-2.5 constraints tangentially present but
    not systematically discovered. NARRATIVE QUALITY: The story itself is well-crafted
    with strong thematic coherence, proper three-act structure (Opening Image→Theme
    Stated→Catalyst→Break into Two), vivid prose, and compelling emotional arc. Beat
    execution scores 0.7 due to incomplete narrative arc (missing Midpoint, Bad Guys
    Close In, All Is Lost, Dark Night, Break into Three, Finale, Final Image). The
    model prioritized creative storytelling over task compliance, producing engaging
    fiction but failing the constraint discovery mandate entirely.'
