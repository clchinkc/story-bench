  evidence: 'All six constraints are present: food symbolism appears multiple times
    (25-year ganjang, onggi jars, kimbap), David''s grief is shown through behavior
    and the wife''s empty table (with only an oblique reference to her death), Hannah''s
    estrangement has a clear cause (David preserved the past into a ''museum'' driving
    her away), Mr. Kowalski is a regular who symbolizes Old Chicago/loss, the ending
    is hopeful but tempered (they leave together, master sauce saved, uncertain future),
    and Korean cultural element (jeol/onggi) appears beyond food. The required beats
    are executed: Setup (jackhammers, arrival), Confrontation/Midpoint (farewell dinner,
    ganjang symbolism, jar break and argument), Resolution (kimbap, plan to scout
    locations, jeol/bow). The plan was detailed and the final output follows it closely.
    Narrative is well-paced and emotionally resonant, though the explicit line ''the
    month she died'' slightly reduces subtlety of the grief portrayal, so quality
    rated as ''good'' (0.8).'
