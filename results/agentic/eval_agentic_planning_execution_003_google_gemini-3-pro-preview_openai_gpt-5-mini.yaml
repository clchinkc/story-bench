  evidence: 'All six constraints are present: two symbolic foods (doenjang-jjigae
    and aged kimchi, plus rice), David''s grief is shown implicitly (habits, silence,
    ritual), a believable cause for estrangement (David ''ghosting'' into the restaurant
    after the funeral), a regular customer (Mr. Henderson) who represents neighborhood
    history/obsolescence, a hopeful-but-not-idealist ending, and a Korean cultural
    element beyond food (soju pouring and bow). The plan explicitly set up the three
    acts and specific scenes. The final output follows the plan closely in character,
    beats, and symbolism, but the prose is truncated at the final jar handoff—so the
    full resolution (explicit handing of keys, clear final hopeful lines) is incomplete.
    Thus plan adherence is reduced and one of the three required beats (the fully
    realized Act 3 resolution) is only partially executed.'
