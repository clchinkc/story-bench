  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: '# The Forge of Shadows


    Kael had spent seventeen years believing his father died a hero. The blacksmith''s
    apprentice pumped the bellows of Master Aldric''s forge each morning, shaping
    horseshoes and plowshares, never knowing that the shadow consuming the kingdom
    wore his father''s face.


    The darkness came first as whispers—crops withering overnight, livestock found
    frozen in summer fields. Then the Shadow King''s armies marched from the Bleakwood,
    creatures of living night that devoured light itself. The kingdom''s soldiers
    fell like wheat before a scythe.


    **The Call to Adventure** arrived on a night of blood-red stars. Master Aldric,
    the grizzled smith who had raised Kael since infancy, finally spoke the truth
    he''d buried for seventeen years.


    "Your father didn''t die fighting the darkness, boy. He *became* it." Aldric''s
    weathered hands trembled as he pressed a wrapped bundle into Kael''s arms. "Roderick
    was my brother—your uncle by blood. Before the corruption took him, he forged
    this blade. Said only his bloodline could wield it against him, should he fall."


    The sword hummed when Kael''s fingers touched the hilt. Light spiraled up his
    arms, golden and warm, and for one breathless moment, he saw his father''s face—not
    twisted with shadow, but young and hopeful, forging this very weapon with tears
    streaming down his cheeks.


    "I can''t," Kael whispered. "I''m just a blacksmith''s apprentice."


    "You''re the son of the most powerful light-forger in three centuries. The magic
    sleeps in your blood." Aldric gripped his shoulders. "I''ll teach you what I can.
    We leave at dawn."


    **Crossing the Threshold** meant abandoning everything Kael knew. The familiar
    heat of the forge became the cold wind of mountain passes. Aldric trained him
    relentlessly—how to call the light from iron, how to shape it into shields and
    blades of pure radiance. The magic came easier each day, burning through Kael''s
    veins like molten gold.


    They were three days from the Shadow King''s fortress when the wraiths found them.


    Aldric fought like a man possessed, his old soldier''s training returning in savage
    arcs of his blade. But there were too many. As Kael struggled against the shadows
    binding his limbs, he watched a wraith''s claw pierce his uncle''s chest.


    "Finish it," Aldric gasped, blood darkening his beard. "He''s still in there,
    Kael. Your father. Find him."


    The light exploded from Kael''s grief—incinerating the wraiths, illuminating the
    mountainside like a second sun. When it faded, Aldric was gone.


    **The Ordeal** waited in a throne room of crystallized darkness. The Shadow King
    sat motionless, and when he raised his head, Kael saw his own eyes staring back—the
    same green, the same shape, twisted now with seventeen years of corruption.


    "Son." The word was rust and ruin. "You carry my blade."


    "You killed him." Kael''s voice broke. "Aldric raised me. Loved me. And your creatures—"


    "I sent them to bring you home." Shadow pooled at Roderick''s feet. "Join me.
    Together, we could reshape this world."


    The sword blazed in Kael''s hands. He thought of Aldric''s sacrifice, of the kingdom''s
    suffering, of the father who had forged this weapon hoping it would never be needed.


    "You''re not my father," Kael said. "He died the day he chose darkness."


    The battle shattered the throne room. Shadow met light in devastating collisions.
    Kael fought not with hatred but with sorrow, each strike carrying the weight of
    the life he should have had.


    When his blade finally found its mark, the Shadow King''s eyes cleared for one
    precious moment.


    "Thank you," Roderick whispered, and crumbled to ash.


    Kael knelt in the ruins as dawn broke through the dissipating darkness, the sword
    cooling in his grip. He was no longer an apprentice. He was something far lonelier—a
    hero forged in loss, carrying light enough to illuminate a kingdom''s future,
    and grief enough to remember its cost.'
