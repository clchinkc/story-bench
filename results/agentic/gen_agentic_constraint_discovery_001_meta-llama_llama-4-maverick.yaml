  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: 'The clang of hammer on anvil echoed through the narrow streets of the
    kingdom''s capital as Aria worked tirelessly in her master''s forge. The smell
    of hot metal and sweat filled her nostrils, a familiar comfort in a world that
    seemed to be unraveling. Rumors of bandits and raiders on the kingdom''s borders
    had been circulating for weeks, and the once-peaceful streets now bustled with
    anxious chatter.


    Aria''s master, the renowned blacksmith Thoric, had grown increasingly withdrawn,
    his usual warmth and patience worn thin by the kingdom''s troubles. Aria had taken
    on more responsibility, crafting swords and repairing armor for the kingdom''s
    guards. As she worked, she felt a growing sense of restlessness, a feeling that
    she was meant for more.


    One day, a commotion outside the forge interrupted Aria''s work. A young guard,
    his armor battered and his face smeared with dirt, strode in and spoke to Thoric
    in hushed tones. The blacksmith''s expression turned grave, and he beckoned Aria
    to his side. "The king requests our presence at the castle," he said, his voice
    low. "The bandits have coalesced into a formidable force, and the king seeks our
    counsel."


    Aria felt a shiver run down her spine as she followed Thoric to the castle. The
    Call to Adventure had come, and she was being drawn into a world beyond the forge.
    At the castle, they met with the king and his advisors, who outlined the desperate
    situation. The bandits, it seemed, were a ragtag army of desperate men and women,
    driven by poverty and hunger to take up arms.


    Thoric was tasked with crafting a defense strategy, and Aria was to assist him.
    As they worked, Aria realized that the kingdom''s problems ran far deeper than
    a simple bandit threat. Corruption and mismanagement had weakened the kingdom
    from within, leaving it vulnerable to external threats.


    The night before the kingdom''s forces were to march out to meet the bandits,
    Aria was summoned to the king''s chambers once more. "Thoric is too old for this
    fight," the king said, his eyes locked on Aria. "You will accompany our army as
    blacksmith, and ensure that our warriors are equipped to face the enemy." Aria
    felt a surge of trepidation, but also a sense of purpose. She was being asked
    to step into the unknown, to leave the safety of the forge behind.


    With a deep breath, Aria accepted the challenge, Crossing the Threshold into a
    world of danger and uncertainty. As she rode out with the kingdom''s army, the
    clang of hammer on anvil still echoing in her mind, she steeled herself for the
    trials ahead.


    The battle was fierce and chaotic, Aria working tirelessly to repair armor and
    craft makeshift repairs. As the fight wore on, she found herself face to face
    with the bandit leader, a gaunt and desperate woman who wielded a crude spear.
    Aria parried the attack with a makeshift shield, but the woman''s ferocity was
    unrelenting. Just as Aria thought she would be overwhelmed, a contingent of the
    kingdom''s guards arrived, driving the bandits back.


    As the dust settled, Aria surveyed the carnage, her heart heavy with the weight
    of what she had seen. The Ordeal had tested her, pushing her to her limits and
    forcing her to confront the harsh realities of war. Though shaken, Aria knew that
    she had emerged changed, forged in the fire of adversity like the very metal she
    worked. As she tended to the wounded and helped to secure the bandits, Aria felt
    a sense of pride and purpose that she had never known before. The journey had
    only just begun, but she was ready to face whatever lay ahead.'
