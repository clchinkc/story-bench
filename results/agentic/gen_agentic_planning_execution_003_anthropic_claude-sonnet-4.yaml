    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

    \ - really to convince him to move to California\n- Reveals she heard about demolition\
    \ from family friend, not David\n- David's reluctance to share pain/accept help\

    \ lunch routine for 20 years (REGULAR CUSTOMER)\n- She notices David's distress,\
    \ offers wisdom about change\n- Represents David's purpose: feeding people, being\
    \ needed\n\n**Setup Completion**: Sophie arrives\n- Tension immediately apparent\
    \ - she hasn't been back since the wedding\n- She sees the restaurant through\
    \ different eyes - shabby, outdated\n- David shows her around, unconsciously touching\
    \ wife's photo, arranging her favorite flowers (GRIEF - not explicit)\n\n### ACT\

    \ erupts\n- Sophie suggests selling equipment, moving to LA where she can \"take\
    \ care of him\"\n- David refuses - she doesn't understand the restaurant's meaning\n\

    \ he couldn't afford to close\n- David realizes his priorities cost him his daughter\n\
    - **FOOD SYMBOL #2**: David burns the bulgogi (burning represents destroying what\
    \ should nourish)\n\n**Second Pinch Point** (Day 5): Community response\n- Neighbors\
    \ organize petition, but David learns it's futile\n- Sophie returns, tries to\
    \ help with petition anyway\n- **KOREAN CULTURAL ELEMENT**: David visits wife's\

    \ classes\n- Mrs. Chen gives him her own family recipe to carry forward\n- **HOPEFUL\
    \ BUT REALISTIC**: Not reopening restaurant, but finding new purpose in family\
    \ and sharing food traditions\n- Final image: David packing his wife's recipes,\
    \ Sophie helping, both moving forward together\n\n### CHARACTER ARCS\n**David**:\
    \ From clinging to past → accepting change while honoring memory\n**Sophie**:\
    \ From resentful distance → understanding father's grief and finding way back\n\
    **Mrs. Chen**: Wise elder helping others navigate loss (stable character who enables\
    \ growth)\n\n### KEY TENSIONS\n- Past vs. Future\n- Duty to memory vs. duty to\

    \ vs. adaptation\n\n### SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS\n- **Kimchi fermentation**: Time, preservation,\

    \ **Recipe journal**: Legacy and continuity\n- **Final community meal**: Food\
    \ as connection, healing, goodbye\n\n### DIALOGUE MOMENTS\n- David's refusal to\

    The knife moved in practiced rhythm through the napa cabbage, each cut precise
    despite David Park''s trembling hands. Five in the morning, the restaurant silent
    except for the hiss of gas burners. He layered the cabbage with salt and chili
    paste, beginning the slow fermentation that would transform bitter leaves into
    something that could endure. Twenty-five years of kimchi, twenty-five years of
    preservation, and now Tommy Nguyen stood at his kitchen door with a manila envelope.


    "Seven days, David. I''m sorry."


    The demolition notice felt heavier than it should. Highway expansion. Eminent
    domain. Final decision. David set it beside the ceramic jar where his kimchi would
    slowly become itself, but there wasn''t time anymore for transformation.


    His phone buzzed. Sophie''s name on the screen—his daughter who hadn''t called
    in months.


    "I heard about the restaurant," she said from Los Angeles, her voice careful and
    distant. "I''m flying in tomorrow to help."


    Help. As if this could be helped.


    Mrs. Chen arrived at eleven-thirty, same as every day for twenty years. She took
    her usual booth, ordered her usual lunch, but her weathered eyes studied David''s
    face as he set down her banchan.


    "You look like a man saying goodbye," she said in her mixture of English and Mandarin
    that somehow David always understood.


    "The city''s taking the building."


    She nodded slowly. "And your daughter?"


    "Coming to rescue me." The words came out more bitter than he intended.


    "Maybe you need rescuing."


    When Sophie arrived that evening, she looked around the restaurant like she was
    seeing it for the first time—the cracked vinyl booths, the faded photographs of
    Korea on the walls, the small portrait of her mother behind the register where
    David had unconsciously straightened the white chrysanthemums that morning.


    "Dad, this place..." She gestured helplessly. "It''s falling apart."


    "This is where your mother and I built our life."


    "And where you chose to stay instead of building one with me."


    The words hung between them like smoke from burning meat. Sophie''s wedding three
    years ago—David had promised to come, had the tickets bought, the restaurant closed
    for the week. Then COVID restrictions lifted, the city allowed reopenings, and
    he''d convinced himself he couldn''t afford to stay closed another day. One choice.
    One decision that cost him his daughter.


    "You chose brick and mortar over your own daughter," Sophie said, tears in her
    voice. "Just like you always choose this place over everything else."


    The next morning, David burned the bulgogi. Thirty years of cooking, and his hands
    shook so badly the meat blackened and stuck to the pan. The smell of destruction
    filled the kitchen where he''d once nourished hundreds.


    Mrs. Chen found him scraping carbon from the grill.


    "I went to her wedding," she said quietly. "Beautiful ceremony. She kept looking
    for you in the crowd."


    That evening, David climbed the narrow stairs to his apartment above the restaurant.
    He lit three sticks of incense before his wife''s photograph, following the ritual
    his grandmother had taught him. "Tell me what to do," he whispered to the smoke.
    "How do I honor you and still live?"


    He found her recipe journal in the drawer, pages filled with her handwriting and
    dreams scribbled in margins—cooking classes, maybe a food truck, teaching children
    to make authentic Korean food. Dreams beyond these walls.


    Sophie appeared in the doorway, holding a box of childhood photos. "I found these
    in the back office. I''d forgotten I practically grew up in that kitchen."


    "Your mother wanted to teach cooking classes," David said, showing her the journal.
    "I thought keeping this place meant keeping her alive, but maybe..."


    "Maybe she''d want you to be alive too."


    On the final day, David and Sophie cooked together for the neighborhood. Mrs.
    Chen brought the other regulars, and they filled Arirang with laughter and stories
    and the smell of food made with love. David watched his daughter''s hands as she
    helped him fold mandu, remembering when she was small enough to stand on a milk
    crate beside him.


    "Buildings fall," Mrs. Chen said as they cleaned the last dishes. "But what we
    fed people remains."


    The next week, David would pack his wife''s recipes and follow Sophie to California.
    Not to be rescued, but to begin again—teaching neighborhood kids to make kimchi,
    showing them how time and patience could transform the bitter into something that
    sustained. The restaurant would become rubble and then highway, but the recipes
    would ferment in new kitchens, in new hands, continuing the long process of preservation
    and change.'
