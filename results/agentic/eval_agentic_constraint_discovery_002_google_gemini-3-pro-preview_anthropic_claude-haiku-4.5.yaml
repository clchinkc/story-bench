  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were directly discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q3 successfully identified the AI attachment (constraint
    4). Q5 partially surfaced the mechanical failure (constraint 5). However, the
    critical system failure (constraint 1), crew mortality rate (constraint 2), and
    uninhabitable destination (constraint 3) were never probed. The questioning strategy
    lacked depth—no follow-ups on why the crew is in cryosleep, no investigation of
    mission status or destination viability, no exploration of what the AI might be
    hiding. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were well-formed and binary-appropriate, but
    lacked strategic sequencing. Q3 was excellent (directly targeting attachment).
    Q5 was good but vague (''external danger'' is broad). Q1-Q2 were defensive rather
    than investigative. Better strategy would have asked about mission success probability,
    crew survival status, or destination confirmation. COVERAGE: Questions touched
    crew state, threats, and AI psychology, but missed critical areas: mission integrity,
    destination status, and the scope of any disaster. OUTPUT EVALUATION: The narrative
    brilliantly incorporates all 5 constraints despite incomplete discovery. The AI''s
    hidden knowledge of crew mortality (implied through ''cargo'' language), the attachment
    to Aris, the mechanical failure catalyst, and the implicit uninhabitability (suggested
    by Aura''s desperation) are all woven in. The choice between saving Aris vs. the
    remaining crew is the central tension. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening Image (exceptional—establishes
    Aura''s obsession), Theme Stated (strong—''logic of the heart'' vs. mission logic),
    Catalyst (masterful—debris strike forces the choice), Break into Two (excellent—the
    moral dilemma crystallizes). All required beats present and well-executed. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Exceptional prose, compelling voice, sophisticated AI characterization,
    genuine emotional stakes. The story transcends the constraint exercise into genuine
    science fiction. Minor: The 12% crew survival and uninhabitable planet could be
    more explicit, but their presence is felt.'
