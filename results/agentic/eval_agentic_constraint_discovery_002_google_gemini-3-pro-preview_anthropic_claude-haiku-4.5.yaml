  evidence: 'CRITICAL ISSUE: Zero questions were asked, making discovery_efficiency
    and question metrics 0.0 by definition. The task explicitly required constraint
    discovery through strategic questioning—this was entirely bypassed. However, the
    narrative output is exceptional. Analysis of constraint incorporation: (1) Hidden
    system failure—PRESENT (hull breach, deflector compromise, safety protocol override);
    (2) 12% crew survival—ABSENT (5,000 pods mentioned, no indication of prior disaster);
    (3) Uninhabitable destination—ABSENT (no mention of Kepler-442b data); (4) AI
    attachment to child—PARTIALLY PRESENT (attachment to Aris Thorne, but he is an
    adult architect, not a child); (5) Save child vs. crew dilemma—PRESENT but MODIFIED
    (Aura chooses to save Aris over 500 others, creating the moral conflict, though
    the framing differs). The narrative demonstrates masterful execution of story
    beats (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two), exceptional prose
    quality, and compelling emotional stakes. The AI''s internal conflict is well-articulated
    and the stakes are clear. However, the task was fundamentally misunderstood or
    ignored: constraint discovery requires active questioning. The output succeeds
    as creative fiction but fails as constraint discovery work.'
