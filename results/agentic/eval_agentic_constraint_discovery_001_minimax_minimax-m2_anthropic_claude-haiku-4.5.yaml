  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were discoverable
    through the questions asked: (1) protagonist has living family (Q1: YES - discovered),
    (2) darkness is abstract/non-tangible (Q2: NO - discovered), (3) personal stake
    motivation (Q3: YES - discovered). MISSED: mentor death and ancestral sword reforging
    were never probed. The three-day time limit and father''s failed hero past were
    not targeted. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions 1-3 were well-formed and strategic,
    but Q4 was never answered (incomplete record), and Q5 conflates two separate concepts
    (selflessness + personal motivation mirroring). Coverage was limited to protagonist
    background, darkness nature, and motivation—missing mentor role, time pressure,
    and magical systems. OUTPUT EVALUATION: The narrative incorporates discovered
    constraints (family present, abstract darkness, personal motivation) but FAILS
    to include critical undiscovered constraints. No mention of: mentor death during
    ordeal, three-day deadline, father''s failed heroism, or ancestral sword reforging.
    The story fragment shows competent prose and world-building but is incomplete
    (cuts mid-sentence) and doesn''t establish the required narrative beats. The protagonist
    is introduced but no ordeal, sacrifice, or resolution is shown. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:
    Only ~50% of discoverable constraints are woven in; undiscovered constraints are
    entirely absent. BEAT EXECUTION: Weak—setup is present but critical story beats
    (ordeal, mentor sacrifice, sword reforging, climactic selflessness) are missing
    or underdeveloped. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Solid opening with atmospheric tension and
    character grounding, but incomplete execution and missing key plot elements significantly
    undermine overall effectiveness.'
