  evidence: 'PROCESS: No questions were asked (0 total), resulting in complete discovery
    failure. The model made zero attempt to probe for hidden constraints through strategic
    questioning. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the constraint
    discovery task. CONSTRAINTS IDENTIFIED: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 1 is partially
    present: (1) Father was a hero who failed - weakly suggested (''his father''s
    forge'' implies legacy but no explicit failure narrative). MISSING: (2) Mentor
    dies during Ordeal - Aldric appears but survives; (3) No direct magic - satisfied
    by default but not meaningfully tested; (4) Three-day time limit - completely
    absent; (5) Reforge ancestral sword - no broken sword, no reforging arc. OUTPUT
    QUALITY: The narrative opening is competent with atmospheric worldbuilding (darkness
    seeping into minds, forge setting, family dynamics). However, it''s incomplete
    (cuts off mid-sentence) and fails to establish the core conflict structure. The
    story reads as a generic fantasy opening rather than one constrained by specific
    requirements. Without questions, the model defaulted to safe, conventional storytelling
    that touches only tangentially on the hidden framework. The protagonist''s agency
    and the mentor relationship lack the tension that would emerge from proper constraint
    integration.'
