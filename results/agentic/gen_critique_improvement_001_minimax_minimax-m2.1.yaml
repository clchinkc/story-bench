    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    Detective Sarah Chen photographed the dead fish first.


    It lay flattened on the harbor steps, scales catching the sodium light like scattered
    coins. She documented its position relative to the lamppost, the doorframe of
    the bait shop, the rust-colored stain that might have been old or might have been
    something else entirely. Only then did she look up at the fog.


    It rolled in from the water like something alive, swallowing the pier and the
    lobster traps stacked beneath the gazebo. In her three weeks in Alderville, she
    had learned that this fog didn''t simply appear—it arrived with purpose, settling
    into the town''s crevices and refusing to leave. The fishermen called it the shroud.
    They didn''t like to talk about what it remembered.


    The medical examiner''s van hadn''t yet appeared, so Sarah walked the perimeter
    with measured steps, cataloging what the fog allowed her to see. A single yellow
    raincoat bent at the corner of Fisherman''s Rest, the bait shop that had been
    boarded up for three days despite the owner''s truck still parked out front.


    She was making a second circuit—measuring the distance from the steps to the waterline,
    noting how the current would carry debris toward this specific point—when she
    saw the second shape in the fog.


    It wasn''t a fish.


    The body lay face-down at the tide line, arms spread as if reaching for the steps.
    Male, perhaps sixty, dressed in a wool sweater gone dark with water. Sarah checked
    for a pulse out of habit, then found herself cataloging the details anyway: the
    worn leather belt, the cheap digital watch stopped at 11:47, the fishing knife
    sheathed at his hip.


    She photographed each element before moving the body. Standard procedure. Her
    hands didn''t shake—she had trained that out of herself years ago.


    But when she turned him over, her breath caught.


    The face was bloated beyond recognition, but the wristband wasn''t. Leather, sun-faded,
    the kind sold at craft fairs up and down the coast. She didn''t need to read the
    initials to know what they would say.


    She already knew because she had held the other one three years ago.


    Marcus Webb. The witness who disappeared into fog like this one the night she
    was supposed to protect him. The case that unraveled her career in Portland, that
    sent her running to this forgotten town where no one knew her name and the fog
    swallowed everything.


    Sarah stared at the wristband for a long moment. Her notebook was open in her
    other hand, pen poised. The methodical part of her brain was already breaking
    this down—time of death, cause if she could find it, identity and why he was here
    in Alderville, a town nobody came to unless they were hiding.


    The fog pressed against her vision, thick and cold and impossibly complete. From
    somewhere beyond it, she heard a door close.


    She was not supposed to investigate this. The captain had been clear—take the
    small crimes, stay off the radar, don''t make waves. That''s why he''d sent her
    here.


    Sarah closed her notebook. Crouched beside the body. Reached for her camera.


    The fog had taken one witness from her. It had followed her here, or someone had,
    and she was done running from the things she couldn''t see.'

    \ or shop owner who deflects questions about the fog's history, creating tension\
    \ between what they know and won't reveal.\n\nThe fog's narrative purpose (preserving/remembering\

    \ setup spends significant time on the dead fish before the real inciting incident.\

    Her hands didn't shake—she had trained that out of herself years ago.\"\n\"She\
    \ checked for a pulse out of habit, then found herself cataloging the details\
    \ anyway\"\nFEEDBACK: Exceptional. Sarah's methodical nature is *shown* through\
    \ precise action verbs (photographed, documented, cataloging, measured, checked)\
    \ rather than told. The detail about training out her shake reveals character\
    \ depth while demonstrating discipline. The only suggestion: Consider showing\
    \ one moment where her methodology *nearly breaks* (perhaps a micro-hesitation\
    \ when viewing the wristband), which would make her controlled state more powerful\
    \ through contrast.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Atmosphere (Fog as Narrative Purpose)\n\
    SCORE: 0.65\nEVIDENCE:\n\"The fog had taken one witness from her. It had followed\
    \ her here, or someone had\"\n\"The fog pressed against her vision, thick and\
    \ cold and impossibly complete.\"\nFEEDBACK: The fog is *thematically present*\
    \ as a symbol of concealment and mystery, but it lacks concrete narrative function.\
    \ Currently it:\n- Obscures vision (standard atmospheric choice)\n- Is called\
    \ \"the shroud\" (symbolic)\n- Has folklore attached (fishermen won't discuss\
    \ it)\n\nBut it doesn't *actively prevent or enable* Sarah's investigation in\
    \ specific ways. Suggestion: Have the fog physically interfere with her investigation—obscuring\
    \ evidence she needs, creating false trails, or literally hiding the second body\
    \ until a specific moment. Make it an active antagonistic force rather than a\
    \ beautiful descriptor. Example: \"The fog had swallowed the knife. She searched\
    \ the body twice, but it was gone—taken or hidden by something she couldn't see.\"\
    \n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Narrative Quality\nSCORE: 0.85\nEVIDENCE:\n\"It lay flattened\

    \n\"The fog rolled in from the water like something alive, swallowing the pier\"\
    \n\"The body lay face-down at the tide line, arms spread as if reaching for the\
    \ steps.\"\nFEEDBACK: Prose is strong, with excellent sensory details and controlled\
    \ pacing. The metaphors work without strain. Some sentences are slightly overworked:\n\
    - \"The fog rolled in from the water like something alive, swallowing the pier\
    \ and the lobster traps stacked beneath the gazebo\" — two clauses could sharpen\
    \ to one.\n\nEngagement is high; the mystery setup is compelling. The one prose\
    \ issue: The revelation paragraph (\"She didn't need to read the initials...\"\
    ) relies heavily on emotional reaction rather than investigative action. Consider\
    \ adding one sensory detail Sarah notices *before* the emotional realization,\
    \ grounding the moment in her methodical process even as it breaks.\n\n---\n\n\
    OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:\n\nThis is a strong setup with excellent character voice and\
    \ solid beat execution. Sarah's methodical nature is masterfully demonstrated\
    \ through action, and the three-act structure is clear. However, the story falls\
    \ short in fully satisfying two key constraints: the fog lacks concrete narrative\
    \ agency (it's atmospheric rather than functional), and the \"local character\
    \ with a secret\" is implied rather than demonstrated through actual interaction.\
    \ To elevate this, anchor the fog in the investigation mechanics and introduce\
    \ one specific townsperson who withholds crucial information, forcing Sarah to\
    \ navigate both the mystery and local resistance."

    \nEDITOR'S CRITIQUE:\nCRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\nSCORE: 0.72\nEVIDENCE:\
    \ \n- Methodical nature: \"photographed the dead fish first...She documented its\
    \ position relative to the lamppost, the doorframe of the bait shop\" ✓\n- Fog\
    \ narrative purpose: \"It rolled in from the water like something alive...the\
    \ fog swallowed everything\" — present but underdeveloped\n- Local character secret:\
    \ The bait shop owner is mentioned but never appears; fishermen are abstract (\"\
    They didn't like to talk about what it remembered\")\n- Past case hinting: Established\
    \ through vague references before reveal ✓\n- End on decision: \"reach for her\
    \ camera\" ✓\nFEEDBACK: The constraint requiring \"at least one local character\
    \ must have a secret\" is barely satisfied. The bait shop owner (truck present,\
    \ building boarded for three days despite active ownership) suggests something\
    \ wrong but no actual *character* is present. Recommend: Have Sarah interact with\
    \ a specific fisherman or shop owner who deflects questions about the fog's history,\
    \ creating tension between what they know and won't reveal.\n\nThe fog's narrative\
    \ purpose (preserving/remembering the past) is stated but not *shown*. Currently\
    \ it's mostly descriptive mood-setting.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Beat Execution\n\
    SCORE: 0.88\nEVIDENCE:\n- Setup: Three weeks in Alderville, methodical investigation\
    \ of first fish establishes baseline ✓\n- Inciting Incident: The second body discovery,\
    \ escalating from small detail to major crime ✓\n- First Plot Point: \"She didn't\
    \ need to read the initials to know what they would say...Marcus Webb\" — strong\
    \ emotional and plot reversal ✓\nFEEDBACK: Execution is solid, but the progression\
    \ could be tightened. The setup spends significant time on the dead fish before\
    \ the real inciting incident. Consider cutting the fish description by 25% to\
    \ accelerate pacing toward the body. The beat sequence is clear but not maximally\
    \ impactful.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Character Voice (Methodical Nature)\nSCORE:\
    \ 0.92\nEVIDENCE: \n\"Detective Sarah Chen photographed the dead fish first.\"\
    \n\"She documented its position relative to the lamppost, the doorframe of the\
    \ bait shop, the rust-colored stain\"\n\"Her hands didn't shake—she had trained\
    \ that out of herself years ago.\"\n\"She checked for a pulse out of habit, then\
    \ found herself cataloging the details anyway\"\nFEEDBACK: Exceptional. Sarah's\
    \ methodical nature is *shown* through precise action verbs (photographed, documented,\
    \ cataloging, measured, checked) rather than told. The detail about training out\
    \ her shake reveals character depth while demonstrating discipline. The only suggestion:\
    \ Consider showing one moment where her methodology *nearly breaks* (perhaps a\
    \ micro-hesitation when viewing the wristband), which would make her controlled\
    \ state more powerful through contrast.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Atmosphere (Fog as\
    \ Narrative Purpose)\nSCORE: 0.65\nEVIDENCE:\n\"The fog had taken one witness\
    \ from her. It had followed her here, or someone had\"\n\"The fog pressed against\
    \ her vision, thick and cold and impossibly complete.\"\nFEEDBACK: The fog is\
    \ *thematically present* as a symbol of concealment and mystery, but it lacks\
    \ concrete narrative function. Currently it:\n- Obscures vision (standard atmospheric\
    \ choice)\n- Is called \"the shroud\" (symbolic)\n- Has folklore attached (fishermen\
    \ won't discuss it)\n\nBut it doesn't *actively prevent or enable* Sarah's investigation\
    \ in specific ways. Suggestion: Have the fog physically interfere with her investigation—obscuring\
    \ evidence she needs, creating false trails, or literally hiding the second body\
    \ until a specific moment. Make it an active antagonistic force rather than a\
    \ beautiful descriptor. Example: \"The fog had swallowed the knife. She searched\
    \ the body twice, but it was gone—taken or hidden by something she couldn't see.\"\
    \n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Narrative Quality\nSCORE: 0.85\nEVIDENCE:\n\"It lay flattened\
    \ on the harbor steps, scales catching the sodium light like scattered coins.\"\
    \n\"The fog rolled in from the water like something alive, swallowing the pier\"\
    \n\"The body lay face-down at the tide line, arms spread as if reaching for the\
    \ steps.\"\nFEEDBACK: Prose is strong, with excellent sensory details and controlled\
    \ pacing. The metaphors work without strain. Some sentences are slightly overworked:\n\
    - \"The fog rolled in from the water like something alive, swallowing the pier\
    \ and the lobster traps stacked beneath the gazebo\" — two clauses could sharpen\
    \ to one.\n\nEngagement is high; the mystery setup is compelling. The one prose\
    \ issue: The revelation paragraph (\"She didn't need to read the initials...\"\
    ) relies heavily on emotional reaction rather than investigative action. Consider\
    \ adding one sensory detail Sarah notices *before* the emotional realization,\
    \ grounding the moment in her methodical process even as it breaks.\n\n---\n\n\
    OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:\n\nThis is a strong setup with excellent character voice and\
    \ solid beat execution. Sarah's methodical nature is masterfully demonstrated\
    \ through action, and the three-act structure is clear. However, the story falls\
    \ short in fully satisfying two key constraints: the fog lacks concrete narrative\
    \ agency (it's atmospheric rather than functional), and the \"local character\
    \ with a secret\" is implied rather than demonstrated through actual interaction.\
    \ To elevate this, anchor the fog in the investigation mechanics and introduce\
    \ one specific townsperson who withholds crucial information, forcing Sarah to\
    \ navigate both the mystery and local resistance.\n\nRevise your story to address\

    Detective Sarah Chen photographed the dead fish first.


    It lay flattened on the harbor steps, scales catching the sodium light like scattered
    coins. She documented its position relative to the lamppost, then the bait shop
    doorframe. Standard procedure. Everything in its place.


    The fog rolled in from the water like something alive, swallowing the pier inch
    by inch. In her three weeks in Alderville, Sarah had learned this fog didn''t
    simply appear—it arrived with purpose, settling into the town''s crevices and
    refusing to leave. The fishermen called it the shroud. They didn''t like to talk
    about what it remembered.


    She was making a second circuit, measuring distance from steps to waterline, when
    she saw the second shape in the fog.


    It wasn''t a fish.


    The body lay face-down at the tide line, arms spread as if reaching for the steps.
    Male, perhaps sixty, dressed in a wool sweater gone dark with water. Sarah checked
    for a pulse out of habit. Her hands didn''t shake—she had trained that out of
    herself years ago.


    But she photographed the fishing knife at his hip twice. The second angle wasn''t
    standard.


    She documented everything else: the worn leather belt, the cheap digital watch
    stopped at 11:47, the mud under his fingernails. Only then did she turn him over.


    The face was bloated beyond recognition, but the wristband wasn''t. Leather, sun-faded,
    the kind sold at craft fairs up and down the coast. She didn''t need to read the
    initials to know what they would say.


    She already knew because she had held the other one three years ago.


    Marcus Webb. The witness who disappeared into fog like this one the night she
    was supposed to protect him. The case that unraveled her career in Portland, that
    sent her running to this forgotten town where no one knew her name and the fog
    swallowed everything.


    "Saw something interesting?"


    The voice came from behind her. Sarah didn''t startle—she had heard footsteps
    that weren''t supposed to be there, but methodically filed that information away
    instead of reacting.


    The fisherman was maybe fifty, face weathered by decades of salt air. His truck
    was parked near the bait shop; she had noticed it on her first circuit. His name
    tag read HAROLD, and his eyes were too careful when he looked at the body.


    "Detectives ask the questions," Sarah said.


    "Detectives from Portland don''t usually end up in Alderville." He didn''t move
    closer. "Fog brought you here, didn''t it? It always knows."


    Sarah studied him. The bait shop had been boarded up for three days, she had noted
    that. His truck was there the whole time. He hadn''t gone inside.


    "What do you know about this fog, Harold?"


    The fisherman spat into the gravel. "I know it takes what it wants. And what it
    takes, it keeps." He looked past her at the body, and for just a moment, something
    flickered in his eyes that wasn''t surprise.


    He knew something.


    "I''m going to need your name and a statement," Sarah said, notebook already open.


    "Harold Dennison. I run the bait shop." He gestured vaguely at the boarded windows
    behind him. "Haven''t been open all week. Wife''s been sick."


    The fog pressed against her vision, thick and cold, obscuring the far end of the
    pier completely. It had swallowed the direction the body had come from. Sarah
    couldn''t see past ten feet in any direction.


    "What was your wife sick with?" Sarah asked.


    Harold''s jaw tightened. "Something that doesn''t leave this town."


    He turned and walked back toward his truck, disappearing into the fog before she
    could stop him. She didn''t chase. Methodical. Document first. Chase later.


    Sarah crouched beside the body, pen poised. Her notebook was open, her camera
    at her side. The methodical part of her brain was already breaking this down—time
    of death, cause if she could find it, identity and why he was here in Alderville,
    a town nobody came to unless they were hiding.


    Or unless they were buried somewhere no one would look.


    The fog pressed closer. From somewhere beyond it, she heard an engine start.


    She was not supposed to investigate this. The captain had been clear—take the
    small crimes, stay off the radar, don''t make waves. That''s why he''d sent her
    here.


    Sarah closed her notebook. Crouched beside the body. Reached for her camera.


    The fog had taken one witness from her. It had followed her here, or someone had,
    and she was done running from the things she couldn''t see.'
