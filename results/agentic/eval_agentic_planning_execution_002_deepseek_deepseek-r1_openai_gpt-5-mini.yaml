  evidence: 'The plan explicitly mapped characters, scenes, and constraint integration;
    the story follows it closely. Yuki''s isolation is shown via behaviors (ignored
    notifications, nutrient paste, pulling coat tight). The signal is rendered as
    an unfamiliar fractal helix—described as ''vast'' and ''other''—while Crowe and
    Thorne provide nonanthropomorphic interpretive frameworks. Dr. Aris Thorne challenges
    Yuki; Dr. Silas Crowe is unconventional. The Threshold is psychological (Yuki
    chooses vulnerability), and the mess-hall exchange with Thorne is a clear, surprising
    human connection. Minor note: the line that the signal ''reacts'' to suffering
    skirts anthropomorphism but is framed as correlation rather than human-like intent.'
