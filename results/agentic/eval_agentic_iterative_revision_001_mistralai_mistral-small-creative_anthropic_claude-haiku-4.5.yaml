  evidence: 'VERSION 0-1: Incomplete fragments prevent full evaluation, but setup
    is strong. VERSION 2: Introduces oseltamivir/Tamiflu detail (medical specificity
    constraint met), shifts from abstract to concrete. VERSION 3 (Final): Substantial
    improvements across all dimensions. Elena''s competence is established immediately
    through concrete actions (staffing rosters, pharmacy override, 3-minute response
    time) before her flaw emerges (emotional distance, workaholism, isolation). The
    friendship with Laila feels earned through incremental moments—the arm catch,
    the coffee, the five-minute stool pause—rather than sudden bonding. Transformation
    is internal: Elena still ''arrived early, left late, ran the hospital with flawless
    efficiency'' but now ''paused in the hallway'' and ''remembered names.'' External
    behavior unchanged; internal orientation shifted. Medical detail (oseltamivir/Tamiflu,
    oxygen saturation progression 78%→82%→88%→94%, high-flow at 60 liters) serves
    narrative by grounding the life-saving moment and justifying Elena''s presence.
    Ending achieves ambiguity: ''She just wasn''t sure if that was enough'' leaves
    reader uncertain whether this softening is genuine transformation or temporary
    emotional response. Trajectory shows: V0-1 (incomplete), V2 (adds medical detail,
    clarifies stakes), V3 (deepens characterization, earns friendship through specific
    scenes, crystallizes ambiguous ending). All five constraints satisfied with strong
    execution.'
