  evidence: Only one hidden constraint (bookshop in financial trouble / must be saved)
    was discovered via the questions and is incorporated in the story. The questions
    missed the broken-engagement departure, the ex‑fiancé-now-mayor, the mother's
    early-stage dementia, and the specific timing/‘last chance in 2 weeks’ festival
    constraint. The story instead uses the father's death as the catalyst (contradicting
    the hidden dementia constraint) and includes a festival rescue but without the
    explicit two-week/last-chance detail. Beats involving the ex‑fiancé/mayor and
    the broken engagement are absent.
