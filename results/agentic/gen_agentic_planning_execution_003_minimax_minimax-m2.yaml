    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations

    ## THREE-ACT STRUCTURE MAP


    ### ACT I: SETUP (Days 1-2)


    **Opening Image:** David in his kitchen at dawn, the restaurant empty, preparing
    the day''s first batch of kimchi—the same recipe his late wife taught him 25 years
    ago.


    **Inciting Incident:** The city notice arrives—demolition in one week for highway
    expansion.


    **Key Beats:**

    - **Day 1:** David receives demolition notice; regular customer Mrs. Chen (elderly
    Korean-American woman) notices his distress

    - **Day 2:** Daughter Sarah calls from California, pushing him to retire and move
    west

    - **Food Symbolism #1:** The kimchi David makes becomes a metaphor for preservation—something
    he wants to save

    - **Korean Cultural Element:** Mrs. Chen brings him Korean tea and shares a hanbok
    story about her grandmother''s migration

    - **Regular Customer Role:** Mrs. Chen represents continuity and tradition; she
    has been coming for 15 years since her husband''s death


    **Character Development:**

    - David as keeper of traditions but resistant to change

    - Sarah''s estrangement cause: She blames David for missing her high school graduation
    when a health emergency in the restaurant kept him working

    - David cannot articulate grief but shows it through small rituals (setting a
    place for his wife during prep)


    **Key Dialogue:**

    - Mrs. Chen: "Some things change, but the taste remains the same. That''s what
    matters."

    - Sarah: "Dad, you can''t keep living in the past. Mom would want you to move
    forward."


    ### ACT II: CONFRONTATION (Days 3-5)


    **Rising Action:**

    - David meets with city planner; learns the fight is nearly impossible

    - He considers relocation but realizes the soul of the restaurant is tied to this
    location

    - Sarah arrives unexpectedly from California


    **Midpoint Confrontation (Day 4):**

    - Sarah finds David in his wife''s old office, holding her recipe cards

    - The fight erupts: Sarah demands he retire, David reveals he can''t leave the
    restaurant because it''s all he has left of their family

    - **Food Symbolism #2:** Sarah attempts to make her mother''s kimchi but fails;
    David realizes she''s been trying to honor her mother from afar


    **Character Development:**

    - David confronts his guilt about prioritizing the restaurant over family

    - Sarah reveals she never learned the family recipes because David was always
    working

    - Mrs. Chen mediates, sharing that her own daughter stopped speaking Korean but
    still comes for the food


    **Key Dialogue:**

    - Sarah: "You chose the restaurant over us. Over me."

    - David: "I thought I was building something for us. Something that would last."

    - Mrs. Chen: "Food is memory. But memories need people to carry them forward."


    ### ACT III: RESOLUTION (Days 6-7)


    **Day 6 - The Choice:**

    - David discovers Mrs. Chen has organized a community dinner for the restaurant''s
    last week

    - Sarah helps David prepare one last service, teaching her the recipes as they
    cook

    - David realizes he can fight for the restaurant while also building something
    new with his daughter


    **Day 7 - The Final Service:**

    - Community dinner brings together old and new neighbors

    - David and Sarah serve together, sharing stories of the restaurant''s history

    - David announces he''s selling the restaurant to a local family who will keep
    it as a Korean restaurant


    **Resolution:**

    - David decides to semi-retire, taking a consulting position at a culinary school

    - Sarah will visit regularly, and they''re planning to write a cookbook together

    - Mrs. Chen promises to help train the new owners in the restaurant''s traditions


    **Hopeful but Realistic Ending:**

    - The restaurant will change, but the traditions will continue

    - David and Sarah''s relationship is healing but won''t be perfect overnight

    - David keeps a small space in the new development for cooking classes


    **Final Food Symbolism:** David gives Sarah his wife''s recipe box—not as a burden,
    but as a bridge between past and future.


    **Final Korean Cultural Element:** The hanbok that Mrs. Chen brought is displayed
    in the new space, connecting generations of immigrants and their American dreams.


    ## CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION SUMMARY


    ✅ **Food Symbolism:** Kimchi represents preservation and family traditions (twice)

    ✅ **Grief Handling:** Never stated explicitly, shown through rituals and inability
    to let go

    ✅ **Estrangement Cause:** Specific—missing daughter''s graduation for restaurant
    emergency

    ✅ **Regular Customer:** Mrs. Chen represents continuity and community memory

    ✅ **Hopeful Ending:** Realistic resolution with ongoing challenges

    ✅ **Korean Cultural Element:** Hanbok story and Korean tea ceremony


    ## PACING & TENSION CURVE


    **Act 1:** Low tension, setup and revelation

    **Act 2:** Rising tension, climax at midpoint confrontation

    **Act 3:** Resolution and catharsis, gentle decline to hopeful ending


    This plan provides a clear path from setup through confrontation to resolution
    while honoring all constraints and building character development around the central
    theme of tradition versus change.'

    David Park''s hands moved through the cabbage with the same reverence he''d shown
    for twenty-five years. The kitchen was still dark, save for the amber glow of
    the industrial lights, and the restaurant felt like a cathedral at this hour—sacred
    and empty. He sprinkled the salt, layered the napa cabbage, and thought about
    the recipe card tucked beneath his cutting board, stained with years of use.


    The city notice arrived just as he was washing his hands. His name, the restaurant''s
    name, and a date that made his stomach drop. One week.


    "You look like you''ve seen a ghost, David-ssi."


    Mrs. Chen''s voice startled him. She''d slipped in through the back door, as she
    always did, carrying a small ceramic pot. At seventy-three, she was his oldest
    regular customer, a widow who had been coming since her husband died fifteen years
    ago.


    "The city wants to tear this down," he said, holding up the paper. "For a highway."


    Mrs. Chen set down the pot and poured steaming tea into two small cups. The aroma
    of roasted barley filled the air—her grandmother''s recipe, she''d told him once.
    "My grandmother carried a hanbok through the war," she said, settling onto the
    stool he kept for her. "Twenty years later, she still wore it to temple. Some
    things survive because we carry them."


    David stared at the tea, steam curling between them like memories he couldn''t
    quite grasp. He thought of the place setting he''d unconsciously set out every
    morning—his wife''s favorite bowl, the one she''d used to eat her kimchi.


    The next day brought Sarah''s call from California.


    "Dad, you need to retire," her voice crackled through the phone. "Move out here.
    You can''t keep working like this forever."


    "I can''t just leave," he said, looking around the restaurant. The walls were
    covered with photos—his daughter''s school plays, his wife''s smile, community
    celebrations. "This place is everything."


    "Mom would want you to move forward, not get stuck."


    But how do you move forward from the place where your life began? Where you met
    your wife and raised your daughter? Where the smell of garlic and sesame oil had
    been the soundtrack to twenty-five years of laughter?


    David tried to find hope in the city planner''s office on Day 3, but the man barely
    looked up from his paperwork. "The decision is final, Mr. Park. The expansion
    will begin next week."


    Relocation was impossible. He''d tried to picture his restaurant somewhere else,
    but the soul of it lived here, in these walls that had absorbed so many stories.


    Sarah arrived on Day 4, unannounced, her suitcase rolling behind her like an accusation.


    She found him in his wife''s old office, holding the recipe box. Sarah''s hands
    trembled as she opened it, revealing hundreds of cards in his wife''s careful
    handwriting.


    "You chose this over me," Sarah said, her voice breaking. "You missed my graduation
    because of some emergency here. I needed you, and you chose the restaurant."


    David''s throat tightened. "I thought I was building something for us. Something
    that would last."


    "But I was your daughter. I was right there."


    Sarah grabbed a head of cabbage and began chopping, her movements aggressive and
    unfamiliar. "I tried to make Mom''s kimchi last year. For her birthday. It was
    terrible. I don''t know any of her recipes because you were always here, always
    working."


    The cabbage fell apart under her knife. David watched his daughter struggle with
    something that should have been second nature, and he understood. She had been
    trying to honor her mother from across the country, with no guidance, no shared
    memories.


    Mrs. Chen appeared in the doorway, carrying her hanbok draped carefully over her
    arm. "My daughter stopped speaking Korean when she turned sixteen," she said softly.
    "Said it was too hard. But she still comes here for the food. Food is memory,
    but memories need people to carry them forward."


    Day 6 brought a surprise. Mrs. Chen had organized a community dinner for the restaurant''s
    last week. Neighbors arrived—old Korean families, young professionals, the Mexican
    family who ran the corner store. They filled the restaurant with stories and laughter.


    Sarah worked beside him, learning to fold dumplings the way his wife had taught
    him. "Show me again," she said, and he did, their hands working together, her
    smaller fingers learning the rhythm his larger ones had perfected.


    On the final day, David made the announcement. "I''m selling to the Kim family,"
    he said. "They want to keep it as a Korean restaurant. Mrs. Chen will help them
    with the traditions."


    The crowd applauded, and David felt something loosen in his chest.


    That evening, he handed Sarah the recipe box. Not as a burden, but as a bridge.


    "We''ll write the cookbook together," she said, tears in her eyes. "Your stories,
    my memories."


    Mrs. Chen hung the hanbok in the new space David would use for cooking classes.
    "My grandmother would like this," she said. "Different people, same traditions."


    David looked around at the faces—some familiar, some new—and realized that Mrs.
    Chen was right. Some things survive because we carry them forward, and sometimes
    that means letting go of the form while keeping the heart.


    The restaurant would change, but the taste would remain the same. And that, he
    thought, was enough.'
