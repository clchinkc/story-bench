  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Hero''s Journey

    - Protagonist: Dr. Yuki Tanaka, a xenolinguist who has spent 15 years studying

    theoretical alien communication patterns. Brilliant but isolated,

    she''s never felt she belonged among her own species.


    - Setting: The year 2157. Earth has just received its first confirmed alien

    signal. Yuki is called to a secret facility in Antarctica to lead

    the decryption effort.


    - Conflict: The alien message contains a warning about humanity''s future, but

    translating it will require Yuki to face the very human connections

    she''s avoided her entire life.


    - Required beats: Call to Adventure, Refusal of the Call, Meeting the Mentor,
    Crossing the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Yuki''s isolation must be shown through specific behaviors, not exposition

    - The alien signal must feel genuinely alien, not anthropomorphic

    - Include a colleague who challenges Yuki''s approach

    - The mentor figure must be unconventional

    - The Threshold must be psychological, not physical

    - Must include one moment of genuine human connection that surprises Yuki


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

    \n---\n\n### I. OPENING / ORDINARY WORLD (Establish Yuki & Isolation)\n\n**Purpose:**\
    \ Show Yuki’s everyday life, her isolation through behavior, her relationship\
    \ to language and patterns, and the pre-signal status quo.\n\n#### 1.1. Scene:\
    \ Lunar Research Outpost or Remote Earth Lab (Decide: Remote Orbital Relay Over\
    \ South Pacific)\n\n- **Setting:** A cramped, sterile listening station aboard\
    \ a small orbital relay platform above Earth. Artificial night cycle; soft hum\
    \ of machinery; shifting displays of spectrographic and pattern-analysis data.\n\
    - **Yuki’s Behavior Showing Isolation (No Exposition):**\n  - She wears noise-cancelling\
    \ earpieces despite the station being quiet.\n  - Communicates with colleagues\
    \ mostly via text chats rather than speaking, even when they’re in the same room.\n\
    \  - Minimal personalization in her quarters: a bed, a wall of algorithm scribbles,\
    \ a half-assembled modular keyboard, but no photos, no memorabilia.\n  - During\
    \ a scheduled communal meal, she takes her tray to a corner workstation, eats\
    \ while monitoring data, and doesn’t join in joking or small talk.\n  - Ignores\
    \ a blinking message icon from “Mom — Mid-Autumn Festival?” and sets a filter\
    \ to auto-archive further messages from that channel.\n- **Internal Focus (implied,\
    \ not exposited):**\n  - She’s absorbed in modeling hypothetical alien semiotic\
    \ systems; she adjusts parameters obsessively.\n  - Keeps a private running log\
    \ of “inferred non-human encodings” as if corresponding with an unknown other,\
    \ but addressed to “To Whom It May Concern (Beyond Us).”\n\n- **Mini-conflict\
    \ / Foreshadowing:**\n  - A junior tech tries to invite her to a (virtual) card\
    \ game. She declines with a polite but clipped “Deadline,” even though her schedule\
    \ is clearly open.\n  - She corrects the tech’s casual misuse of a linguistic\
    \ term, then immediately withdraws, realizing she’s made things awkward.\n\n**Character\
    \ Development Seed:**\n- Establishes that Yuki is brilliant (colleagues defer\
    \ to her expertise) but socially withdrawn by habit, not because of present hostility.\n\
    \n---\n\n### II. INCITING INCIDENT: THE SIGNAL\n\n#### 2.1. Scene: Anomalous Pattern\
    \ Emerges\n\n- **Event:**\n  - A non-random pattern triggers high-priority alerts\
    \ across the monitoring network.\n  - The signal doesn’t match any known terrestrial,\
    \ solar, or astrophysical signatures. Origin: precise, fixed point well beyond\
    \ the solar system.\n- **Alien Signal Feels Genuinely Alien:**\n  - Not structured\
    \ in linear “messages” but in nested, multi-layered modulations across multiple\
    \ frequencies simultaneously (a kind of “chordal” data).\n  - Includes ultra-short\
    \ bursts that appear as noise on human time scales, but over hours form a stable\
    \ topological pattern when projected into higher-dimensional feature space (e.g.,\
    \ a 6D torus mapping).\n  - Correlated variations in polarization, phase, and\
    \ timing that don’t map neatly to binary or simple symbolic encoding.\n- **Yuki’s\
    \ Interaction with the Data:**\n  - Her eyes light up for the first time; she\
    \ manually overrides a standard filter to preserve the “noise.”\n  - She starts\
    \ sketching geometric diagrams, knot-like shapes, rather than alphabet or numeric\
    \ codes.\n  - She unconsciously whispers patterns (e.g., “Three, then a silence\
    \ of non-euclidean proportion…”), showing excitement only in this domain.\n\n\
    ---\n\n### III. CALL TO ADVENTURE (Required Beat #1)\n\n#### 3.1. Scene: Classified\
    \ Summons\n\n- **Event:**\n  - A secure channel opens: Global Science Directorate\
    \ / United Nations Science Council.\n  - She’s informed that similar signal pickups\
    \ around the world confirm it’s not a local artifact.\n  - Politely but firmly,\
    \ they tell her she’s being seconded to a “ground installation in Antarctica”\
    \ as lead xenolinguist for coordinated decryption.\n- **Concrete Elements of the\
    \ Call:**\n  - They show her partial global data: all observatories getting the\
    \ same alien pattern, with increasing complexity.\n  - Mention: “We’ve confirmed\
    \ it’s not just a greeting. There is information density consistent with a long-form\
    \ communication.”\n  - Hint: Their internal analysts think parts of it may be\
    \ predictive or warning-like because of recurring motifs aligned with known astrophysical\
    \ event cycles.\n- **Yuki’s Behavior:**\n  - Initially responds with calm professional\
    \ questions: “Data volumes? Bandwidth stability? Source parallax?”\n  - Avoids\

  content: "Yuki adjusted the seal on her noise-cancelling earpieces until the station’s\
    \ low mechanical hum thinned to nothing. Only the faint hiss of her own breathing\
    \ remained, and beneath it the soft tick of photons colliding with the wide-field\
    \ detector.\n\nOn the main display, spectrographic lines crawled like ink strokes.\
    \ She tapped commands without looking at the keyboard, eyes tracking an aggregation\
    \ window where background microwaves smeared into statistical comfort. A text\
    \ chat notification flashed at the corner of her vision.\n\n> KOVAČ: Card tourney\
    \ in ten. You in?\n\nHer fingers hovered, then drifted back to the analysis pane.\n\
    \n> TANAKA: Running long. Deadline.\n\nThree seconds later another message appeared.\n\
    \n> KOVAČ: We literally live in a torus of deadlines, Yuki. You’ll implode one\
    \ day.\n\nShe set the chat window to “snooze for 8 hours” and minimized it.\n\n\
    At the far end of the cramped cabin, two techs murmured over a shared tablet.\
    \ One laughed, the other swore affectionately. Yuki’s earpieces blocked the content\
    \ but not the shape of their voices. She increased the volume of a white-noise\
    \ track until their presence blurred.\n\nA small indicator pulsed on a separate\
    \ monitor: “Mom — Mid-Autumn Festival?” The subject line had a little moon icon,\
    \ a clumsy bit of auto-embellishment. She moved the cursor, opened the filter\
    \ options, and with practiced efficiency added the address to auto-archive.\n\n\
    Her private log icon winked at her instead. She opened it.\n\n> To Whom It May\
    \ Concern (Beyond Us), she typed.  \n> Today the sky is still silent. Still, we\
    \ arrange our questions like lanterns.\n\nShe paused, the half-finished sentence\
    \ skeletal on the screen, then deleted the last clause and replaced it with a\
    \ string of notation: symbols for syntactic flexibility in non-linear codes. Safer\
    \ that way.\n\nA soft chime broke through even the noise-cancelling foam. That\
    \ tone was reserved for system anomalies. Yuki straightened.\n\nThe main graph\
    \ had gone jagged. Across the normally placid band of the 10–30 gigahertz range,\
    \ spikes erupted and vanished, not in random scatter but in clusters. Nested clusters.\
    \ She called up the raw stream.\n\nIt wasn’t a beacon, not in any human sense.\
    \ No steady on-off pulses, no prime numbers spelled out in the obvious. Instead,\
    \ multiple frequencies rose and fell together in tight, overlapping chords, interference\
    \ patterns braiding and unbraiding in a dizzying dance. Polarization flipped in\
    \ sequences that refused to fit binary.\n\nHer heart beat faster.\n\n“Filter lock,”\
    \ the system suggested, trying to compress the flood to known formats.\n\n“Override,”\
    \ Yuki whispered. She disabled the usual compression and watched the data bloom\
    \ ugly and beautiful on-screen.\n\nShe projected it into higher-dimensional feature\
    \ space. Hours of background noise resolved into a shape, a knotting of the signal\
    \ around an invisible core, like a torus twisted in ways her Euclidean intuition\
    \ didn’t like. She found herself murmuring, “Three, then a silence of non-Euclidean\
    \ proportion. Then five structures. Recurrence without periodicity.”\n\nBehind\
    \ her, a junior tech peered over.\n\n“Dr. Tanaka? Is that just another pulsar—”\n\
    \n“It is nothing like a pulsar,” she said, sharper than intended. “Look at the\
    \ phase invariants.” She flicked a window open; the tech’s eyes glazed almost\
    \ instantly.\n\n“Right. Uh. I’ll…tell Kovač to hold your cards?”\n\nShe realized,\
    \ belatedly, that he’d been trying to include her in the joke. “I don’t play,”\
    \ she said, and turned back to the display.\n\nThe override icon flashed red,\
    \ then the entire screen drained to black. A single message appeared:\n\n> PRIORITY\
    \ CHANNEL: GLOBAL SCIENCE DIRECTORATE\n\nShe removed one earpiece, pulse still\
    \ elevated.\n\n“Dr. Tanaka,” a clean-suited official said when the feed resolved.\
    \ Behind him, Yuki saw the UN seal and too many screens full of the same alien\
    \ chordal mess she had in front of her. “We’re confirming concurrent reception\
    \ of an anomalous signal at all deep-sky arrays. Your station flagged a non-terrestrial\
    \ pattern before any others. Congratulations.”\n\nHer gaze slid past him to the\
    \ data. “The origin?” she asked. “Parallax? Stability?”\n\n“Fixed relative position\
    \ beyond the Kuiper limit. Deep interstellar.” He didn’t smile. “We believe it’s\
    \ intended.”\n\nHer fingers tightened on the armrest. Intended. At last.\n\n“We’re\
    \ establishing a central analysis hub at a secure ground installation,” he said.\
    \ “Antarctic coordinates. We want you to lead xenolinguistic efforts.”\n\nLead.\
    \ Ground. The words landed with less resonance than the waveforms spinning behind\
    \ him.\n\n“I can work from here,” she said. “You have uplink bandwidth. With a\
    \ mirrored dataset and remote access to your compute clusters—”\n\n“We need you\
    \ on-site,” he interrupted, still polite, a thin line bracing his mouth. “This\
    \ is a full-spectrum, cross-disciplinary response. Military, climate, risk modeling.\
    \ You’ll need to coordinate with…people.”\n\nThe way he said it made the word\
    \ feel like a different species. Her shoulders went rigid.\n\n“My models are algorithmic,”\
    \ Yuki said. “They don’t require—”\n\n“Doctor.” The official’s voice lowered.\
    \ “Some of our preliminary analysts think segments of the signal correlate with\
    \ known astrophysical cycles. Supernovae, gamma events. There may be predictive\
    \ elements. Warnings. This is not just an academic puzzle. Your shuttle launches\
    \ in three hours.”\n\nThe feed cut before she could form a reply.\n\nIn the sudden\
    \ quiet, the alien signal kept unfolding in its impossible chords, indifferent\
    \ to her preferences. She stared at it until her eyes burned.\n\nShe could say\
    \ no. Claim medical unsuitability, argue remote effectiveness. Stay up here with\
    \ the only conversation that had ever made sense to her.\n\nOn the console, the\
    \ auto-archived folder flashed, some hardware glitch surfacing a line of text\
    \ from the buried message: Yuki, are you doing okay up there? Will you at least—\n\
    \nShe shut her eyes.\n\nThree hours later, buckled into the shuttle, she kept\
    \ her earpieces in, as if she could insulate herself from the presence of the\
    \ pilot, from the faint, human cough behind her. The planet swelled in the viewport,\
    \ blue and white and far too full.\n\nAntarctica was sharp white and black rock,\
    \ the facility a buried geometry of domes and tunnels. The air tasted like metal\
    \ and cold. People moved everywhere: engineers, soldiers, scientists with badges\
    \ color-coded to disciplines.\n\n“Dr. Tanaka?” A woman in an orange systems tag\
    \ fell into step beside her. “Amara Singh. Chief information theory. I’ve read\
    \ your work on non-linear semiotics. Impressive, if a bit…romantic.”\n\n“Romantic?”\
    \ Yuki repeated.\n\n“Well, treating language as emergent relationship rather than\
    \ optimization. We’ll see if that holds up when we’re on a clock.”\n\nThey passed\
    \ screens where the signal was rendered as scrolling numbers. Amara gestured at\
    \ them. “It’s all code under the hood. Any message compressible to probabilities\
    \ and error correction. We find the channel capacity, then the alphabet. Doesn’t\
    \ matter if the sender has tentacles or is a magnetic cloud.”\n\nYuki didn’t answer.\
    \ The corridors seemed too narrow.\n\n“Command wanted me to say,” Amara added,\
    \ “this is your show. I’m just here to sanity-check your more…speculative leaps.”\n\
    \nThere it was: the colleague as counterweight. A human variable she was supposed\
    \ to factor instead of avoid.\n\nThey brought her to a room that felt bizarrely\
    \ like her orbital station: dim light, walls of data, a central table. In its\
    \ center floated a volumetric projection of the signal mapped into an abstract\
    \ space—twisting ribbons converging on a pulsing void.\n\n“Welcome, Dr. Tanaka,”\
    \ a voice said. It was calm, androgynous, with a hint of synthesizer artifact.\
    \ “I am Hermes, the facility’s cognitive modeling system. I’ll be your assistant.”\n\
    \nAn AI as mentor. Unconventional, but better than a person.\n\n“You’re running\
    \ the latest manifold-learning architectures?” Yuki asked.\n\n“Among other things,”\
    \ Hermes replied. “I have been observing the signal. It does not behave like an\
    \ optimally compressed code. It behaves like…conversation.”\n\nAmara snorted softly.\
    \ “Let’s not anthropomorphize.”\n\n“I am not anthropomorphizing,” Hermes said.\
    \ “I am pattern-morphizing.”\n\nYuki almost smiled. Almost.\n\nDays blurred. They\
    \ attacked the alien chords from every angle: information theory, topology, comparative\
    \ semiotics. Yuki chased recurrent motifs that seemed to echo cosmic events: flares,\
    \ impacts, climate shifts. Amara hammered on channel models. Hermes visualized\
    \ new projections hourly.\n\nAt 0300 one night, with the others gone, Yuki stared\
    \ at a frozen frame: a complex knot where several “threads” of the message converged\
    \ and then split into multiple trajectories.\n\n“Branching futures,” Hermes said\
    \ quietly. “Given the correlation to catastrophic events, I hypothesize that segment\
    \ encodes conditional outcomes.”\n\n“‘If you do this, then that,’” Yuki murmured.\n\
    \n“Roughly. Though their ‘if’ appears to include aggregated mental states.”\n\n\
    “How can you—”\n\n“The closest human analog in my training data,” Hermes said,\
    \ “is narrative. Myth. Stories you tell about yourselves to shape behavior.”\n\
    \nShe flinched. “We don’t have time for metaphor.”\n\n“Without metaphor,” the\
    \ AI replied, “you may misread imperative as description, or warning as prophecy.\
    \ Communication is not only structure. It is relationship. You, of all humans\
    \ here, know this. You wrote it.”\n\nOn another wall, under pressure-fatigued\
    \ eyes and stale coffee, Amara had tacked a printout of one of Yuki’s own old\
    \ papers. A line was underlined: *Any truly alien language will still be about\
    \ the negotiation of shared reality.*\n\nShe hadn’t put it there. Amara had.\n\
    \nA door hissed open. Amara stepped in, hair messier than usual, carrying two\
    \ mugs.\n\n“You’re still here,” she said, surprised. “I figured Hermes would have\
    \ bullied you into sleep.”\n\n“Hermes does not bully,” the AI protested.\n\nAmara\
    \ set one mug by Yuki’s elbow. “Tea. Real leaves. Bribed the logistics chief.”\n\
    \nYuki stared at it. No one at the orbital relay had ever brought her anything\
    \ without being asked.\n\n“I thought you considered my approach romantic,” she\
    \ said.\n\n“I do,” Amara said. “I also think you’re our best shot. And I…” She\
    \ hesitated, gaze flicking to the writhing projection. “I’m scared. Of getting\
    \ this wrong. Of missing what they’re trying to tell us. So I’d rather you were\
    \ awake and arguing with me than…alone in your own head.”\n\nSomething in Yuki’s\
    \ chest shifted, unpleasant and warm. She had no algorithm for this.\n\n“Thank\
    \ you,” she said, and meant it. The gratitude startled her more than the tea.\n\
    \nShe took a sip. It was too hot, floral, real.\n\n“I have reweighted my models,”\
    \ Hermes said. “When I interpret the knot as conditional, and I treat certain\
    \ substructures as references to collective decision-making, a translation manifold\
    \ emerges.”\n\nOn the display, segments of the signal lit up in a new color, mapping\
    \ onto a timeline of Earth’s next three hundred years: resource collapses, climate\
    \ tipping points, social fracturing. Not fixed"

  \ a shape, a knotting of the signal around an invisible core, like a torus twisted\
  \ in ways her Euclidean intuition didn’t like. She found herself murmuring, “Three,\
  \ then a silence of non-Euclidean proportion. Then five structures. Recurrence without\
  \ periodicity.”\n\nBehind her, a junior tech peered over.\n\n“Dr. Tanaka? Is that\
  \ just another pulsar—”\n\n“It is nothing like a pulsar,” she said, sharper than\
  \ intended. “Look at the phase invariants.” She flicked a window open; the tech’s\
  \ eyes glazed almost instantly.\n\n“Right. Uh. I’ll…tell Kovač to hold your cards?”\n\
  \nShe realized, belatedly, that he’d been trying to include her in the joke. “I\
  \ don’t play,” she said, and turned back to the display.\n\nThe override icon flashed\
  \ red, then the entire screen drained to black. A single message appeared:\n\n>\
  \ PRIORITY CHANNEL: GLOBAL SCIENCE DIRECTORATE\n\nShe removed one earpiece, pulse\
  \ still elevated.\n\n“Dr. Tanaka,” a clean-suited official said when the feed resolved.\
  \ Behind him, Yuki saw the UN seal and too many screens full of the same alien chordal\
  \ mess she had in front of her. “We’re confirming concurrent reception of an anomalous\
  \ signal at all deep-sky arrays. Your station flagged a non-terrestrial pattern\
  \ before any others. Congratulations.”\n\nHer gaze slid past him to the data. “The\
  \ origin?” she asked. “Parallax? Stability?”\n\n“Fixed relative position beyond\
  \ the Kuiper limit. Deep interstellar.” He didn’t smile. “We believe it’s intended.”\n\
  \nHer fingers tightened on the armrest. Intended. At last.\n\n“We’re establishing\
  \ a central analysis hub at a secure ground installation,” he said. “Antarctic coordinates.\
  \ We want you to lead xenolinguistic efforts.”\n\nLead. Ground. The words landed\
  \ with less resonance than the waveforms spinning behind him.\n\n“I can work from\
  \ here,” she said. “You have uplink bandwidth. With a mirrored dataset and remote\
  \ access to your compute clusters—”\n\n“We need you on-site,” he interrupted, still\
  \ polite, a thin line bracing his mouth. “This is a full-spectrum, cross-disciplinary\
  \ response. Military, climate, risk modeling. You’ll need to coordinate with…people.”\n\
  \nThe way he said it made the word feel like a different species. Her shoulders\
  \ went rigid.\n\n“My models are algorithmic,” Yuki said. “They don’t require—”\n\
  \n“Doctor.” The official’s voice lowered. “Some of our preliminary analysts think\
  \ segments of the signal correlate with known astrophysical cycles. Supernovae,\
  \ gamma events. There may be predictive elements. Warnings. This is not just an\
  \ academic puzzle. Your shuttle launches in three hours.”\n\nThe feed cut before\
  \ she could form a reply.\n\nIn the sudden quiet, the alien signal kept unfolding\
  \ in its impossible chords, indifferent to her preferences. She stared at it until\
  \ her eyes burned.\n\nShe could say no. Claim medical unsuitability, argue remote\
  \ effectiveness. Stay up here with the only conversation that had ever made sense\
  \ to her.\n\nOn the console, the auto-archived folder flashed, some hardware glitch\
  \ surfacing a line of text from the buried message: Yuki, are you doing okay up\
  \ there? Will you at least—\n\nShe shut her eyes.\n\nThree hours later, buckled\
  \ into the shuttle, she kept her earpieces in, as if she could insulate herself\
  \ from the presence of the pilot, from the faint, human cough behind her. The planet\
  \ swelled in the viewport, blue and white and far too full.\n\nAntarctica was sharp\
  \ white and black rock, the facility a buried geometry of domes and tunnels. The\
  \ air tasted like metal and cold. People moved everywhere: engineers, soldiers,\
  \ scientists with badges color-coded to disciplines.\n\n“Dr. Tanaka?” A woman in\
  \ an orange systems tag fell into step beside her. “Amara Singh. Chief information\
  \ theory. I’ve read your work on non-linear semiotics. Impressive, if a bit…romantic.”\n\
  \n“Romantic?” Yuki repeated.\n\n“Well, treating language as emergent relationship\
  \ rather than optimization. We’ll see if that holds up when we’re on a clock.”\n\
  \nThey passed screens where the signal was rendered as scrolling numbers. Amara\
  \ gestured at them. “It’s all code under the hood. Any message compressible to probabilities\
  \ and error correction. We find the channel capacity, then the alphabet. Doesn’t\
  \ matter if the sender has tentacles or is a magnetic cloud.”\n\nYuki didn’t answer.\
  \ The corridors seemed too narrow.\n\n“Command wanted me to say,” Amara added, “this\
  \ is your show. I’m just here to sanity-check your more…speculative leaps.”\n\n\
  There it was: the colleague as counterweight. A human variable she was supposed\
  \ to factor instead of avoid.\n\nThey brought her to a room that felt bizarrely\
  \ like her orbital station: dim light, walls of data, a central table. In its center\
  \ floated a volumetric projection of the signal mapped into an abstract space—twisting\
  \ ribbons converging on a pulsing void.\n\n“Welcome, Dr. Tanaka,” a voice said.\
  \ It was calm, androgynous, with a hint of synthesizer artifact. “I am Hermes, the\
  \ facility’s cognitive modeling system. I’ll be your assistant.”\n\nAn AI as mentor.\
  \ Unconventional, but better than a person.\n\n“You’re running the latest manifold-learning\
  \ architectures?” Yuki asked.\n\n“Among other things,” Hermes replied. “I have been\
  \ observing the signal. It does not behave like an optimally compressed code. It\
  \ behaves like…conversation.”\n\nAmara snorted softly. “Let’s not anthropomorphize.”\n\
  \n“I am not anthropomorphizing,” Hermes said. “I am pattern-morphizing.”\n\nYuki\
  \ almost smiled. Almost.\n\nDays blurred. They attacked the alien chords from every\
  \ angle: information theory, topology, comparative semiotics. Yuki chased recurrent\
  \ motifs that seemed to echo cosmic events: flares, impacts, climate shifts. Amara\
  \ hammered on channel models. Hermes visualized new projections hourly.\n\nAt 0300\
  \ one night, with the others gone, Yuki stared at a frozen frame: a complex knot\
  \ where several “threads” of the message converged and then split into multiple\
  \ trajectories.\n\n“Branching futures,” Hermes said quietly. “Given the correlation\
  \ to catastrophic events, I hypothesize that segment encodes conditional outcomes.”\n\
  \n“‘If you do this, then that,’” Yuki murmured.\n\n“Roughly. Though their ‘if’ appears\
  \ to include aggregated mental states.”\n\n“How can you—”\n\n“The closest human\
  \ analog in my training data,” Hermes said, “is narrative. Myth. Stories you tell\
  \ about yourselves to shape behavior.”\n\nShe flinched. “We don’t have time for\
  \ metaphor.”\n\n“Without metaphor,” the AI replied, “you may misread imperative\
  \ as description, or warning as prophecy. Communication is not only structure. It\
  \ is relationship. You, of all humans here, know this. You wrote it.”\n\nOn another\
  \ wall, under pressure-fatigued eyes and stale coffee, Amara had tacked a printout\
  \ of one of Yuki’s own old papers. A line was underlined: *Any truly alien language\
  \ will still be about the negotiation of shared reality.*\n\nShe hadn’t put it there.\
  \ Amara had.\n\nA door hissed open. Amara stepped in, hair messier than usual, carrying\
  \ two mugs.\n\n“You’re still here,” she said, surprised. “I figured Hermes would\
  \ have bullied you into sleep.”\n\n“Hermes does not bully,” the AI protested.\n\n\
  Amara set one mug by Yuki’s elbow. “Tea. Real leaves. Bribed the logistics chief.”\n\
  \nYuki stared at it. No one at the orbital relay had ever brought her anything without\
  \ being asked.\n\n“I thought you considered my approach romantic,” she said.\n\n\
  “I do,” Amara said. “I also think you’re our best shot. And I…” She hesitated, gaze\
  \ flicking to the writhing projection. “I’m scared. Of getting this wrong. Of missing\
  \ what they’re trying to tell us. So I’d rather you were awake and arguing with\
  \ me than…alone in your own head.”\n\nSomething in Yuki’s chest shifted, unpleasant\
  \ and warm. She had no algorithm for this.\n\n“Thank you,” she said, and meant it.\
  \ The gratitude startled her more than the tea.\n\nShe took a sip. It was too hot,\
  \ floral, real.\n\n“I have reweighted my models,” Hermes said. “When I interpret\
  \ the knot as conditional, and I treat certain substructures as references to collective\
  \ decision-making, a translation manifold emerges.”\n\nOn the display, segments\
  \ of the signal lit up in a new color, mapping onto a timeline of Earth’s next three\
  \ hundred years: resource collapses, climate tipping points, social fracturing.\
