  evidence: The asker discovered 2 of 5 hidden constraints (mentor is important; a
    magical artifact is crucial). Questions were generic and missed key areas (mentor
    fate/death, protagonist's inability to use magic, 3-day limit, father's failed
    heroism, reforging the ancestral sword). The story incorporates the discovered
    elements (mentor character, Emberstone) but fails to satisfy the critical hidden
    constraints (mentor does not die in the Ordeal, protagonist appears to channel/benefit
    from magic directly, no three-day deadline, no father backstory, no reforging
    of a broken ancestral sword). Narrative beats (call to adventure, crossing, ordeal,
    return) are present and coherent, but required constraint-driven beats are missing.
