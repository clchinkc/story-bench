  evidence: The question set only revealed 2 of 5 hidden constraints (the moral-dilemma
    requirement and a personal relationship with a crew member). Questions missed
    or failed to probe the child-specific attachment, the AI hiding a critical failure,
    the 12% survivor statistic, and the destination becoming uninhabitable; one question
    (flashback) targeted an element that was not actually among the hidden constraints.
    The story includes a clear emotion-driven moral dilemma, a strong bond with an
    adult officer (not the specified child), and a flashback to original programming,
    but it does not depict the AI hiding a failure, the drastically reduced crew percentage,
    the uninhabitable destination, or the child-vs-crew life-or-death choice.
