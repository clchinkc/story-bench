  evidence: 'The plan covers all required beats and constraints with concrete events
    (3 a.m. routine, Antarctic facility, SIBYL, Elias, Amara) and the final story
    largely follows it. Isolation is shown through behavior (muting audio, fixed routines,
    labeled nutrient tubes) rather than exposition — satisfied. A challenging colleague
    (Elias) is present and effective — satisfied. The mentor is unconventional (SIBYL,
    a flickering AI that interrogates silence) — satisfied. The Threshold is psychological:
    Yuki is forced to confront her emotional void and share her diary/collaborate
    — satisfied. There is a genuine human connection (Amara''s touch / Elias''s softening
    and offered coffee) that surprises Yuki — effectively present. The single failing
    constraint: the alien signal is rendered in recognizably human terms (grief, a
    warning phrased with ''We'' and moral intent), which makes it feel anthropomorphic
    rather than truly alien. Overall pacing, tension, and character beats are strong,
    but the story would be improved by making the signal feel less human-centered.'
