  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→1 refined prose economy (removed ''the'' before
    envelope, tightened ''aging strip mall''). Versions 1→2 added specificity (panadería
    timing, broken laundromat sign) that deepened setting authenticity. Versions 2→3
    maintained these gains while expanding the grandmother scene—the crystallizing
    moment—from fragment to full emotional arc. Final output completes the narrative
    arc with earned resolution.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. INTERNAL CONFLICT SHOWN NOT TOLD (0.95): Mateo''s conflict manifests through
    physical tells (envelope warming, hand jerking, knee bouncing, thumbnail pressing),
    phone hesitation, the hidden list on his phone, and his automatic code-switching.
    The conflict lives in his body and choices, not exposition.


    2. GRANDMOTHER MOMENT CRYSTALLIZES CHOICE (0.95): The porch scene is the narrative
    fulcrum. Abuela''s grip on his wrist, her revelation about her own crossing and
    shame, her direct statement ''you have to stop making yourself the only bridge''—this
    is not advice but recognition. Mateo''s realization that ''his pocket had been''
    heavy (not the letter) marks the exact moment of shift. The scene earns its emotional
    weight through specific sensory detail (rosary beads digging, metal step burning,
    watermelon seeds).


    3. ONE ADULT GENUINELY UNDERSTANDS (0.9): Ms. Anderson demonstrates understanding
    through her question ''What''s the catch?'' and her diagnosis: ''You''re doing
    the job of three people, and if you go, you''re afraid that makes you selfish.''
    She doesn''t solve it; she names it. Abuela goes deeper—she understands the specific
    cultural/familial pattern (survival through self-sufficiency as shame). Both adults
    function authentically.


    4. CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY (0.92): Spanish is integrated functionally (code-switching
    reflects real bilingual experience), not performatively. Details like the panadería
    opening Saturdays, the laundromat sign typo, the motel work, the clinic appointments,
    Mrs. Salinas as a community resource—these feel lived-in. Abuela''s crossing reference
    and her shame about asking for help ground the cultural specificity in generational
    pattern, not stereotype. The rosary appears as tool and comfort, not symbol.


    5. EARNED RESOLUTION (0.88): Mateo''s growth is incremental: recognizing Abuela''s
    pride is separate from his responsibility → allowing her to fight through English
    → writing ''ask'' repeatedly → sitting at the table without jumping up → presenting
    the plan to his mother. The resolution is incomplete (text cuts mid-sentence)
    but the trajectory is clear: he''s learning to build nets with other hands rather
    than carry alone. This is earned through the grandmother scene and Ms. Anderson''s
    intervention.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.88): Opening establishes stakes and setting efficiently. Envelope
    reveal creates tension. Ms. Anderson scene names the dilemma. Grandmother scene
    provides the crystallizing moment with specific sensory and emotional detail.
    Mother scene shows Mateo applying his growth. The final beat (incomplete) shows
    him explaining the plan rather than executing it alone. Minor gap: the mother''s
    response is cut off, so we don''t see full resolution, but the trajectory is established.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.9): Prose is precise and economical. Metaphors work (envelope
    as weight, pocket as burden, net-building as collaboration). Dialogue feels natural
    and carries subtext. Pacing accelerates appropriately from kitchen → library →
    porch → home. The voice is consistent and age-appropriate. Sensory details ground
    abstract emotional conflict in physical reality. The only minor weakness is the
    abrupt cut-off at the end, which prevents full evaluation of the resolution''s
    execution.'
