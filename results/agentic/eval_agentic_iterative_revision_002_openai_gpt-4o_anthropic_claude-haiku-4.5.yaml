  evidence: 'REVISION TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS:


    Versions 0-3 show incremental refinement in sensory language (asphalt → freshly
    laid asphalt, coffee → strong black coffee), with Version 3/Final maintaining
    strongest opening. Sensory details remain consistent and prominent throughout.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:


    1. NON-VISUAL SENSORY DETAILS (0.9/1.0 - STRONG): Excellent execution. Opening
    paragraph layers jackhammer hum, laptop whir, ambient noise filtering, asphalt
    scent, taco truck aroma, coffee bitterness. Mid-section adds jazz music, email
    chime, pastry aroma, coffee stirring sounds, cane tapping, street sounds (barking,
    laughter, vendors). Closing includes humid air, distant sirens. Sensory details
    are genuinely prominent and woven throughout.


    2. IMANI''S BLINDNESS AS STRENGTH (0.85/1.0 - GOOD): Portrayed respectfully. Braille
    display mentioned naturally. Her auditory expertise is positioned as superior
    to sighted detective''s abilities. Cane tapping is integrated without pity. However,
    portrayal could be deeper—her blindness feels somewhat functional rather than
    fully integrated into her identity and worldview. Missed opportunity to show how
    her blindness shaped her investigative philosophy.


    3. SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE (1.0/1.0 - EXCELLENT): The metallic clink is clearly established
    as crucial. Mentioned as "distinctive metallic clink that others might have missed,"
    later revealed as "metal on metal" at construction site. This drives the entire
    investigation forward and becomes the linchpin of the mystery.


    4. CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION (0.9/1.0 - STRONG): Detective Carter''s skepticism
    is clear: "You''re telling me a sound is going to crack this case?" with "eyebrows
    raised, clearly underestimating her abilities." His arc includes redemption ("now
    respecting her auditory prowess"). Minor issue: underestimation could be more
    pronounced or layered earlier.


    5. FUN AND GAMES ENTERTAINMENT (0.6/1.0 - ADEQUATE): This is the weakest constraint
    execution. The section exists ("Imani turned the investigation into an engaging
    hunt... lively community affair, with laughter and shared excitement") but feels
    summarized rather than shown. Lacks specific entertaining moments, dialogue, or
    scenes that would genuinely engage readers before the dark turn. The transition
    to darkness is abrupt rather than earned through demonstrated fun.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.75/1.0):

    - Hook: Strong opening with sensory immersion ✓

    - Inciting Incident: Email tip about cold case ✓

    - Fun and Games: Present but underdeveloped ✗

    - Midpoint: Implied but not clearly marked

    - Dark Turn: Occurs but feels rushed ("Yet, as pieces fell into place, the mood
    darkened")

    - Climax/Resolution: Somewhat resolved but lacks tension


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.7/1.0):

    Strengths: Atmospheric opening, strong sensory foundation, clear mystery premise,
    respectful disability representation, thematic coherence (gentrification, community,
    perception).


    Weaknesses: Pacing feels rushed in final third. The "Fun and Games" phase is told
    rather than shown. Villain motivation (developers) introduced late and underdeveloped.
    Ending feels somewhat tidy given the dark setup. Missing specific scenes with
    dialogue and tension. The podcast community participation is mentioned but not
    dramatized.


    PRESERVATION (0.85/1.0):

    All versions maintained core sensory strengths. Progression from V0→V3 refined
    language ("counterpoint" restored, "expertly filtering" added, specificity increased).
    No good elements were lost; refinements were additive.


    FEEDBACK RESPONSIVENESS (0.75/1.0):

    The final output addresses most constraints but shows uneven implementation. Strong
    on sensory details, audio clue, and underestimation. Weaker on showing (not telling)
    the Fun and Games phase and deepening Imani''s blindness as identity rather than
    just functional detail.'
