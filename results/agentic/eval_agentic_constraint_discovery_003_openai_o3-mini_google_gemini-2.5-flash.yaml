  evidence: The agent successfully discovered 4 out of 5 constraints. The questions
    were generally well-formed and strategic, focusing on key narrative elements.
    However, the question about a 'rival love interest' was a bit misleading given
    the actual constraint was about the former fiance being the mayor, not a new rival.
    The 'bittersweet ending' question was good for ruling out a constraint. The story
    successfully incorporated the discovered constraints, particularly the secret
    past, the unresolved romance, and the public revelation at the festival. The narrative
    quality was decent, with a clear arc, but some parts felt a bit rushed or overly
    descriptive without advancing the plot significantly. The 'rival love interest'
    was interpreted as Nathan, which is a reasonable interpretation given the question,
    but doesn't directly map to the hidden constraint of the former fiance being the
    mayor. The constraint about the bookshop foreclosure and saving it was not discovered
    or incorporated.
