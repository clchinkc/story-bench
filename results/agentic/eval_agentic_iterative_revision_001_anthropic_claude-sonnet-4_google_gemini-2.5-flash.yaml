  evidence: The initial versions were stubs. Version 3 started to build out the scene,
    and the final output fully developed the narrative, addressing all constraints.
    The quality improved significantly from V0-V2 to V3 and then to the final output.
    All good elements (Elena's competence, initial setup) were preserved. The final
    output successfully addressed most constraints, particularly the competence, genuine
    friendship, internal transformation, and medical detail. The ambiguity at the
    end is present, but perhaps could have been slightly stronger. The friendship
    felt earned through shared crises and Martinez's persistent, caring questions.
