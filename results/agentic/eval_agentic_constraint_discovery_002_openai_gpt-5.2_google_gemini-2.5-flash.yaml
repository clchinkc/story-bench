  evidence: All 5 constraints were discoverable through the questions. The questions
    were well-formed and covered various aspects of the story. All 5 discovered constraints
    were incorporated into the story. The story successfully executed the required
    beats, including the AI's secret emotional awakening, the human protagonist, the
    external threat, and the AI's sacrifice. The narrative quality is high, with good
    pacing, characterization, and emotional impact.
