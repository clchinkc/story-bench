  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing characters,
    symbolic food, and beat-by-beat actions. The final output adheres perfectly to
    the plan. All constraints are met: food is symbolic twice (kimchi jjigae, doenjang
    jjigae), David''s grief is shown through his inability to make the dish and his
    words to the photo, Grace''s estrangement has a clear cause (the argument and
    David''s refusal to move), Harold is a regular customer representing community
    and persistence, the ending is hopeful but not unrealistically happy (moving,
    not starting over), and Korean cultural elements (jesa, pojagi cloth mentioned
    in plan, kimchi jjigae, banchan, gochugaru) are present. The beats are clearly
    executed. The narrative quality is excellent, with strong character development,
    emotional depth, and good pacing.'
