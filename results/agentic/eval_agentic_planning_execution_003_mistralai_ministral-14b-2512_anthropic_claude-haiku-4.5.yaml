  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with clear character arcs, thematic
    development, and structural beats. Output executes most constraints effectively:
    (1) Food symbolism present twice—third place setting as grief marker, burned doenjang
    jjigae as emotional failure, final bingsu as renewal; (2) David''s grief implicit
    throughout via ritual, avoidance, and trembling hands rather than explicit statement;
    (3) Mira''s estrangement has specific cause—she blamed David for ''not being there''
    during mother''s illness, creating believable relational fracture; (4) Mr. Kim
    represents continuity and witness to David''s stagnation; (5) Ending is hopeful
    but constrained—small cart, uncertain future, modest reconciliation rather than
    triumphant resolution. WEAKNESS: Korean cultural element constraint only partially
    satisfied. Plan mentions pansori songs and pojangmacha carts, but execution includes
    only pojangmacha reference and bingsu (dessert). Missing deeper cultural integration—could
    have included more explicit cultural practice (e.g., jesa ritual, specific holiday
    observance, or deeper pansori/traditional music element). Pansori is mentioned
    in plan but absent from output. EXECUTION GAPS: Plan''s detailed character development
    translates well to narrative, but some specificity lost—the recipe book discovery
    feels slightly rushed; Mira''s California tech job mentioned in plan but underutilized
    in output; the city council interview mentioned but not dramatized. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Strong emotional arc with effective use of sensory detail (food, scent,
    texture). Pacing deliberate and appropriate for literary fiction. Tension builds
    through demolition notice and father-daughter confrontation. Resolution avoids
    saccharine ending while maintaining hope. Dialogue feels natural. Symbolism of
    cart-as-adaptation works thematically.'
