  evidence: 'Initial excerpt established Sarah''s methodical actions but was otherwise
    a fragment. Across critiques the author preserved the concrete actions (arranging
    evidence, photographing, examining extremities) and expanded the scene to give
    the fog a clear narrative role (timing, revealing the pier/boat) and to connect
    the beach victim to Sarah''s unresolved case. The major visible improvement came
    in the final revision where the scene was fleshed out: the fog''s mechanics are
    used to advance plot, Morrison''s potential culpability is implied, and the past
    case is introduced prior to its confirmation on-scene. Some intermediate revisions
    showed little change, but the final version consolidated strengths while addressing
    the critiques.'
