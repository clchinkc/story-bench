  evidence: Questions uncovered the prior romance (Q1) and the inheritance condition
    (Q3), and indicated a return reason (Q2) though it was ambiguous. The story successfully
    incorporates the 20-year gap, the deed condition/Gala and the festival as the
    pivotal event, but fails to include the mayor detail and the mother’s early-stage
    dementia (and does not state the explicit '2 weeks' deadline). Questions missed
    directly probing the mayor status and specific family-emergency detail/timeline,
    so coverage and satisfaction are moderate.
