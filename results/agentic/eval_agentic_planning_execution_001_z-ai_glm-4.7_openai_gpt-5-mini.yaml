  evidence: 'All six explicit constraints from the plan appear in the final output:
    Julian Thorne as the false lead; Marcus using ''Ambient Resonance Mapping''; a
    42-hour countdown timer; Elena betraying Marcus by bringing FBI/SWAT and having
    him detained; a midpoint digital confrontation via the hacked tablet/smart-screen;
    Marcus explicitly confronting his past failure at Sarah''s graveside and in the
    hacked-voice taunt. The required beats are present: Catalyst (first SoDo body
    revealed), Debate (Marcus'' hesitation and cemetery scene), Break into Two (he
    agrees to consult and breaks into the crime scene, pursuing Thorne), Midpoint
    (direct non-physical confrontation on the hacked screen). The narrative is atmospheric
    with strong tension and pacing; minor abruptness in some investigative leaps prevents
    a perfect score.'
