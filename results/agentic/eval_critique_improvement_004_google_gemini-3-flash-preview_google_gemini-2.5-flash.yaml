  evidence: The revisions consistently improved the specificity and depth of Teddy's
    interiority, directly addressing the feedback from the critiques. Early versions
    were a bit generic in describing his routine and internal state, but later versions,
    especially the final one, added rich details like the 'sweat-darkened handle of
    his walking stick' and the 'loud, hollow tick of the wall clock' to convey his
    loneliness and hesitation. The disruption became more impactful, and the introduction
    of Sarah and the milkweed provided a clear 'new path' that directly contrasted
    with his old, grief-bound routine. The prose quality also became more evocative
    and precise with each iteration.
