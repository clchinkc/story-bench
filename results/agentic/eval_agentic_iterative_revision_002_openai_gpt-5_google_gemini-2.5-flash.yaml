  evidence: The initial versions focused solely on the opening image, which was well-crafted
    from the start. The revisions refined the sensory details, particularly the audio,
    making it more vivid and specific (e.g., 'tin-bright horns,' 'cough-cough-wheeze').
    The core strength of the opening, Imani's non-visual perception, was consistently
    maintained and enhanced. The final output successfully integrated all constraints,
    building on the strong foundation of the opening. The 'Fun and Games' section
    genuinely entertains with Imani's wit and unique approach to investigation, and
    the turn to dark is sudden and effective. The underestimation by the foreman is
    clear, and Imani's blindness is consistently portrayed as a strength through her
    acute hearing and analytical skills. The specific audio clue (the bell and lift
    alarm) is central to the plot.
