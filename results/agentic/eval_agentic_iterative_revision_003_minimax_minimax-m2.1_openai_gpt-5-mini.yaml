  evidence: 'Versions 0–3 are essentially unchanged from the initial fragment (same
    opening lines repeated), so there was little demonstrable iterative improvement
    across the intermediate revisions. The final output, however, makes a substantial
    expansion: it adds the bus-stop scene, the unanswered ticket and Luis''s text,
    the telenovela living-room scene, and the grandmother''s confession that crystallizes
    Mateo''s choice. This final revision addresses the constraints and raises the
    overall quality, but the change occurs only at the last stage rather than through
    a clear, incremental revision trajectory.'
