  evidence: 'All six constraints appear in the final output: false lead (Evan Cole
    the janitor), unconventional profiling (Marcus''s ''soundprint'' acoustic mapping),
    ticking clock (repeated ''Midnight'' and ''four nights/choirs'' warnings), secondary-character
    betrayal (Aria preparing to publish the acoustic map), Midpoint direct confrontation
    (killer broadcasts over the building PA; Marcus speaks to the voice), and Marcus
    explicitly confronts his past failure (confession about Elise on the PA). Required
    beats—Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint—are all present and clearly labeled.
    The written plan section was empty, so plan completeness/specificity/adherence
    are scored 0.'
