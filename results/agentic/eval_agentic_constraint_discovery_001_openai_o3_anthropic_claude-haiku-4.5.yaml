  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The questioning strategy identified only 2 of 5 hidden
    constraints. Q1 correctly identified the mentor character requirement (Helric),
    earning a YES. However, the remaining questions failed to probe deeper constraint
    categories. Q2-Q5 were answered NO, missing critical constraints entirely. The
    three-day time limit was never discovered—no question targeted temporal constraints.
    The ancestral sword reforging was not discovered—no question asked about object
    transformation or magical artifacts. The protagonist''s father''s failed heroism
    was never discovered—no question probed family backstory. The ''no direct magic''
    constraint was partially addressed but not explicitly tested. QUESTION QUALITY:
    Questions were reasonably well-formed but lacked strategic depth. They tested
    narrative voice, morality, character type, and length—but missed temporal mechanics,
    object requirements, family history, and ability restrictions. A more targeted
    approach (e.g., ''Does a constraint involve time pressure?'' or ''Must the protagonist
    inherit or restore something?'') would have been more effective. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:
    The story incorporates Helric (mentor) prominently and avoids direct magic use
    by Rowan (he uses tools, not spells). However: (1) Helric does NOT die during
    the Ordeal—he survives and greets Rowan at the end, violating a core constraint.
    (2) No three-day countdown is present; the timeline is vague. (3) Kingsbane is
    destroyed rather than reforged—the ancestral sword restoration is inverted. (4)
    Rowan''s father is never mentioned; his father''s failed heroism is absent. BEAT
    EXECUTION: The Hero''s Journey structure is well-executed with clear Call, Refusal,
    Threshold, Tests, Ordeal, Reward, and Return beats. The Ordeal is dramatic and
    emotionally resonant. However, the Ordeal fails to deliver the mentor''s death,
    which should be the climactic sacrifice. NARRATIVE QUALITY: The prose is engaging,
    atmospheric, and character-driven. Rowan''s arc from doubt to tempered strength
    is compelling. The forge metaphor is thematically coherent. Serah is a functional
    ally. The pacing works well. The story reads as complete and satisfying—but this
    satisfaction comes from ignoring rather than satisfying hidden constraints.'
