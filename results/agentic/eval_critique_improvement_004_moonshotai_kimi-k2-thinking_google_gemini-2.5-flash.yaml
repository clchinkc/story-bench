  evidence: 'The critiques focused on Teddy''s interiority being somewhat remote or
    superficial. The final version significantly deepens this by adding lines like
    ''Some mornings he stood at his window and watched his own feet move, as if they
    belonged to someone else'' and ''He told himself he was preserving memories, but
    the truth was simpler: the route was safe.'' This directly addresses the feedback
    about his inner life being present but not fully explored. The ''new path'' constraint
    is met, but the ''something the old path couldn''t'' is only hinted at, not fully
    realized in the provided excerpt. The other constraints are well-satisfied. The
    prose quality is strong, and the beats (routine, disruption, new path) are clear.'
