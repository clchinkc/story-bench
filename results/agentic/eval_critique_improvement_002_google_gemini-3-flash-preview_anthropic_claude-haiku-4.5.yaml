  evidence: 'The revision trajectory demonstrates exceptional responsiveness to critique
    feedback. Early critiques (0.87-0.88) identified emotional complexity as strong
    but flagged potential ending issues. The final output preserves the high-scoring
    emotional moments (''lip trembled,'' ''sharp cold pressure behind his eyes'')
    while substantially strengthening the ending through Marcus''s active choice to
    erase the safe joke and rewrite the scene—transforming passive pathos into earned
    character transformation. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Humor before sadness realized—''toenail
    clippings'' joke lands early, showrunner laughs, before Marcus''s internal emptiness
    is revealed. (2) Theme stated by minor character—Jerry explicitly articulates
    ''comedy is truth people are too scared to say'' and Maya delivers the thematic
    core (''You''re writing a suicide note with a laugh track''). (3) Comedy craft
    specificity—detailed dissection of ''rule of three'' as armor, reversal mechanics,
    the ''button'' concept, and the strategic use of punchlines as defense mechanisms.
    (4) New writer sees through Marcus—Maya''s notebook sketch, her recognition of
    his hiding, her direct confrontation (''I used to keep your scripts under my pillow''),
    and her refusal to laugh at his deflection joke. (5) Almost-break moment with
    joke cover—''For a second, his lip trembled...He felt the dam begin to give way''
    followed immediately by ''Well...I''d be a priest. But the benefits are terrible
    and I look like a giant thumb in a cassock.'' BEAT EXECUTION: Inciting incident
    (Maya''s arrival), rising action (the scene dissection), midpoint crisis (Maya''s
    confrontation), climax (Marcus erases the safe joke), resolution (turning off
    phone, committing to truth). The Save the Cat structure is present though compressed.
    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0→V3 shows refinement in specificity (''twelve-hundred-dollar
    Herman Miller'' vs generic ''ergonomic chair''), deepening of Maya''s characterization
    (the notebook detail, the ring-twisting), and most critically, the addition of
    Marcus''s active choice at the end rather than passive resignation. The final
    version transforms from ''sad man makes jokes'' to ''man chooses vulnerability
    over safety.'' PRESERVATION: The toenail joke, Jerry''s character voice, the fluorescent
    light imagery, and the core emotional beats all survive intact while supporting
    structure strengthens around them.'
