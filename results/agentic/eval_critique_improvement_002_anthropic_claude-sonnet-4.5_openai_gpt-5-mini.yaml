  evidence: 'Across the revisions the piece preserved the opening laugh (''Elsa''s
    been drinking'') while progressively deepening the undercutting pathos and craft
    detail. Early versions already hit the humor, but later edits foregrounded Marcus''s
    emptiness (the line ''returned to his seat, and felt absolutely nothing''), added
    the marker-snap/almost-break moment masked by a joke, and gave Lauren clearer,
    non-naive beats (reading his hand, calling for ''something real''). Craft details
    (COJC grid, ''setup/misdirect/tag'', ''three jokes per page'') are explicit in
    later drafts. Overall the trajectory shows incremental tightening rather than
    wholesale rewrites: strengths (comic beats) were preserved and weaknesses (emotional
    clarity, showing vs telling) were addressed, yielding a stronger final with satisfying
    balance between humor and pathos.'
