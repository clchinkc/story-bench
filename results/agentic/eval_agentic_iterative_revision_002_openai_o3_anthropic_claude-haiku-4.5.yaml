  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: V0→V1 shifted from passive observation to embodied sensory
    immersion (fire-escape grate, heat prickling). V1→V2 introduced temporal precision
    and field-note methodology, establishing Imani''s systematic strength. V2→V3 crystallized
    her voice through Speech-to-Text logging and specific audio taxonomy (440 Hz,
    392 Hz), moving from description to active expertise. Final output maintains this
    arc while deepening stakes and sensory texture. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Non-visual
    sensory details PROMINENT—cinnamon foam, damp flannel, ozone thickening, petrichor,
    rust taste, belt buckle ping, rope sliding, instant coffee on breath, acetone
    smell. Woven throughout, not decorative. (2) Blindness as STRENGTH—Imani''s 15-year
    listening cartography is her investigative superpower; she catches studio-clean
    audio that sighted investigators miss; her ear identifies the culprit''s voicemail
    squeak vs. field recordings; she streams live while sighted Debbie is captured.
    Portrayed with dignity and agency. (3) SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE—The 440 Hz/392 Hz dumbwaiter
    squeak is the linchpin: it appears in voicemail, becomes obsession, identifies
    crime scenes via permit mapping, and ultimately betrays the culprit''s location.
    Crucial to resolution. (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION—Debbie Chen initially dismisses
    audio analysis (''Viral video beats audio any day''), pops gum dismissively, must
    be corrected by Imani. Later captured, requiring rescue. (5) FUN AND GAMES ENTERTAINS
    BEFORE DARK—Episodes 1-42 are genuinely playful: paleta-cart trades, live-tweet
    guessing game, Foley artist DMs, podcast virality, cold-brew sponsorships, Serial
    comparison. Tone is celebratory, community-driven. Tonal shift occurs at ''Bad
    Guys Close In'' with ozone/thunder, voicemail trap, and physical threat. BEAT
    EXECUTION: Opening Image (0.95)—specific, sensory-rich, establishes method. Catalyst
    (0.9)—clear inciting incident, introduces audio clue and Debbie''s skepticism.
    Fun and Games (0.85)—entertaining but slightly compressed; could expand community
    moments. Bad Guys Close In (0.88)—effective tension escalation, though the ''studio-clean
    squeak'' reveal feels slightly abrupt. Resolution (0.85)—satisfying but brief;
    Debbie''s rescue feels slightly underexplored. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is sharp
    and specific (Hilti jackhammer, Romeo Santos track, nylon bushing). Voice is distinct
    and confident. Sensory language avoids cliché (damp flannel vs. humid blanket).
    Thematic coherence strong: sound as evidence, listening as power, community as
    witness. Minor weakness: the culprit''s motivation remains opaque (why target
    Imani''s building?). The ''two hundred thousand witnesses'' resolution is clever
    but slightly convenient. PRESERVATION: All strong elements from V0-V2 retained:
    the fire-escape setting, the Bustelo mug, the specific neighborhood sounds, Debbie''s
    character, the podcast framework. V3''s Speech-to-Text innovation and frequency-specific
    audio taxonomy preserved and deepened in final. No regression.'
