  evidence: 'The plan is comprehensive and detailed, covering all constraints and
    beats. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan, executing each element
    with strong narrative quality. All 6 constraints are met: false lead (Dr. Thorne),
    unconventional profiling (Sensory Mimicry), ticking clock (48 hours, then 12 hours),
    betrayal (Elias), direct confrontation at midpoint (with the killer on the phone),
    and explicit past failure (Pete''s death). All 4 beats (Catalyst, Debate, Break
    into Two, Midpoint) are clearly present and well-executed. The narrative is engaging,
    well-paced, and builds tension effectively.'
