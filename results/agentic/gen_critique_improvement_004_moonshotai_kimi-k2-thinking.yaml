    STORY THEORY: Story Circle


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker
    who has

    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for

    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.


    - Central conflict: When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will
    take 6 months,

    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting

    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.


    - Tone: Quietly profound, observant, gently humorous


    REQUIRED BEATS: You (comfort zone), Need (want something), Go (unfamiliar situation),
    Search (adapt to it)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Teddy''s routine must be shown with specific, loving detail

    - The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been avoiding

    - Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s

    - Teddy''s late wife must be present through absence

    - The new path must offer something the old path couldn''t


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - character_interiority: Is Teddy''s inner life rich and specific?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Story Circle beats properly executed?

    - subtlety: Are emotions conveyed through action and detail, not exposition?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and resonance


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: 'Teddy Washington''s left knee popped on the seventh step every morning.
    He listened for it the way other men listened for the weather report—confirmation
    that the world was still turning. At 6:42 AM, he passed the Chen family''s coffee
    shop, where Mrs. Chen always unlocked the door, her key ring singing its four-note
    song. By 6:51, he reached the crack on Maple that looked like Ohio, a shape he''d
    studied since 1984.


    Three miles exactly, measured in memories rather than footsteps. The house where
    his daughter took her first steps, now a yoga studio. The library where he''d
    met Marianne, its windows boarded. He''d walked this loop through her illness,
    through retirement, through the quiet that followed. The sidewalk had become a
    rosary.


    On Tuesday, the "Street Closed" sign appeared on Jefferson. A plywood wall with
    a permit expiring in November. Six months. The foreman shrugged. "Water main,
    pops. Gotta go around."


    The detour took him past St. Agnes Cemetery, a place he''d avoided for eight years.
    Marianne''s plot waited there, but his feet had never carried him. The route had
    protected him from the finality of stone.


    Now, on unfamiliar pavement, he noticed things. A community garden where a parking
    lot used to be. A woman his daughter''s age, wrestling a grapevine that had swallowed
    a fence. She wore a Detroit Tigers cap backward.


    "Morning," Teddy said, surprised by his own voice.


    She looked up. "You''re the guy who walks by at 6:47. Like clockwork."


    Teddy felt exposed. "Construction," he explained.


    "Yeah, they''re tearing up the whole block." She stood, cracking her back. "I''m
    Sarah. Trying to save my grandmother''s house. The one with the purple door."


    He knew it. A Victorian they''d called an eyesore. Now it was "historic."


    "She died last year," Sarah continued. "Left me this place and a mortgage I can''t
    afford. Making it a bed-and-breakfast, but..." She gestured at the vine. "The
    past doesn''t let go easy."


    Teddy looked at the garden. Tomatoes heavy on the vine, beans climbing strings.
    A child''s drawing taped to the toolshed. He thought of Marianne''s roses, the
    ones he''d let go to seed because pruning them alone felt like admitting something.


    "I could help," he said. "With the vines. Used to be good with my hands."


    Sarah studied him. "Tomorrow? Same time?"


    He nodded, the unfamiliar weight of a yes settling in his chest. The new route
    home took him past the river, something he hadn''t seen in forty years. At the
    corner of 3rd and Maple, he paused at the Ohio-shaped crack. Then he stepped over
    it, taking the long way around. '

    SCORE: 0.74

    EVIDENCE: "He listened for it the way other men listened for the weather report—confirmation
    that the world was still turning" and "The sidewalk had become a rosary."

    FEEDBACK: The interiority is effective but somewhat remote. Teddy''s emotional

    see the decision but not the internal struggle preceding it: "He thought of Marianne''s

    Add a moment where Teddy''s contradictory impulses are in active tension—the pull
    toward Sarah, the gravity of his grief, his fear of change. Consider: "His mouth
    opened to say no. What came out was yes."

    CRITERION: constraint_satisfaction

    SCORE: 0.96

    EVIDENCE: All five constraints are satisfied:

    1. Routine with loving detail: "Mrs. Chen always unlocked the door, her key ring
    singing its four-note song"

    2. Disruption reveals avoidance: The street closure forces him past St. Agnes
    Cemetery—"a place he''d avoided for eight years"

    3. Neighbor with intersecting story: Sarah''s grandmother''s house parallels Teddy''s
    own loss through inheritance and property

    4. Late wife present through absence: Marianne woven throughout—the library, the
    roses, the eight years of walking

    5. New path offers something new: The community garden, Sarah''s presence, the
    river unseen for forty years


    FEEDBACK: Excellent constraint execution. Minor enhancement: The cemetery passage
    could be slightly extended to show Teddy''s physical reaction to passing it (does
    he look away? Does his pace change?), making the avoidance more visceral.

    CRITERION: beat_execution

    SCORE: 0.68

    EVIDENCE: You ✓ (comfortable routine), Need ✗ (unclear), Go ✓ (detour), Search
    ✓ (adaptation)

    FEEDBACK: The critical weakness is the Need beat. What does Teddy *want*? The
    story presents him as reactive rather than goal-driven. His want must be clarified—is
    it connection? Redemption? Permission to grieve differently? Currently, Sarah
    initiates; Teddy responds. Strengthen the Need by showing what Teddy unconsciously
    seeks before the disruption. Perhaps: "He''d walked this loop for eight years,
    marking time but never changing it. Some mornings he wondered what it would feel
    like to step off the path." This creates active want, not passive routine.


    ---


    CRITERION: subtlety

    SCORE: 0.77

    EVIDENCE: Strongest moment—stepping over the Ohio crack at the end is symbolic
    action without explanation. Weakest moment—"Teddy felt exposed" tells rather than
    shows.

    FEEDBACK: You''ve mostly nailed the "show, don''t tell" principle. However, tighten
    this: "Teddy felt exposed" → show it through action: "He stepped backward, as
    if distance might make him invisible." Also, this line is slightly on-the-nose:
    "he''d walked this loop through her illness, through retirement, through the quiet
    that followed." The list of griefs tells the story; let us infer the progression.
    Consider: "He''d walked this loop for eight years. The sidewalk knew his footsteps
    better than she ever would."


    ---


    CRITERION: narrative_quality

    SCORE: 0.82

    EVIDENCE: Beautiful prose moments: "her key ring singing its four-note song,"
    "The sidewalk had become a rosary," "The past doesn''t let go easy."

    FEEDBACK: The prose is genuinely lovely, with strong metaphors and sensory specificity.
    One area for tightening: "A woman his daughter''s age, wrestling a grapevine that
    had swallowed a fence." The "swallowed" verb choice is strong; consider whether
    similar precision and specificity can be applied throughout. Also, the transition
    paragraph "Now, on unfamiliar pavement, he noticed things" is slightly tell-y.
    Let the noticing unfold naturally. Minor note: "taking the long way around" at
    the very end is less evocative than the Ohio-crack moment; consider ending on
    that image of stepping over the crack, which crystallizes his internal shift wordlessly.


    ---


    # OVERALL_ASSESSMENT


    This is a genuinely well-crafted story that satisfies nearly all requirements
    with elegant prose and emotional resonance. Its primary limitation is that Teddy''s
    internal wanting remains too passive and implicit—he needs stronger, clearer desire
    that drives him toward change rather than merely accepting it. The story would
    be elevated to exceptional if Teddy''s fear and resistance were made more visceral,
    and if the prose occasionally traded gentleness for a sharper emotional specificity.'

    EVIDENCE: "Some mornings he wondered what it would feel like to step off the path.
    But the seventh step always brought him back." and "the unfamiliar weight of a
    yes settling in his chest"

    FEEDBACK: Teddy''s inner life is present but remains somewhat surface-level. You
    show us WHAT he feels (the weight, the wondering) but rarely WHY. His relationship
    with Marianne, his connection to his daughter, and his actual emotional state
    regarding grief remain largely unexplored. Consider deepening moments like his
    reaction to learning about Sarah''s grandmother. What specific memory does it
    trigger? Does he think about his daughter? The most powerful interiority would
    involve competing emotions—fear and desire, guilt and hope—not just single feelings.
    Add a moment where Teddy''s thoughts contradict his actions, revealing internal
    conflict.

    CRITERION: constraint_satisfaction

    SCORE: 0.93

    EVIDENCE: All five constraints present—(1) Routine: "At 6:42 AM, he passed the
    Chen family''s coffee shop, where Mrs. Chen always unlocked the door, her key
    ring singing its four-note song"; (2) Disruption/avoidance revealed: "he''d avoided
    for eight years. Marianne''s plot waited there, but his feet had never carried
    him"; (3) Neighbor intersection: Sarah with her grandmother''s house parallels
    his loss; (4) Absence of wife: Marianne referenced through the library, the roses,
    the meet-cute location; (5) New path offers: "the river, something he hadn''t
    seen in forty years" and human connection

    FEEDBACK: Excellent constraint satisfaction. Your only potential weakness is that
    Sarah''s parallel to Teddy could be more carefully woven. Right now the connection
    feels slightly explained ("The past doesn''t let go easy") rather than discovered.
    Consider having Sarah mention something specific about her grandmother''s death
    that echoes Teddy''s experience before he consciously recognizes the parallel.

    CRITERION: beat_execution

    SCORE: 0.72

    EVIDENCE: You (established immediately); Need (less clear—Teddy doesn''t have
    an active want until Sarah appears); Go (the detour forces him into unfamiliar
    territory); Search (he attempts to help, steps over the crack)

    FEEDBACK: The Story Circle is present but the "Need" beat is the weakest link.
    Teddy is *acted upon* by the construction rather than *wanting something*. The
    story would strengthen if Teddy had an internal desire before the detour—perhaps
    he''s aware of his stagnation and the route is suffocating him, even subconsciously.
    This would make his "yes" to Sarah feel like an active choice rather than passive
    acceptance. Currently, the arc reads as: disrupted routine → accident of exposure
    → acceptance. Stronger would be: trapped in routine → forced confrontation → *chooses*
    connection.

    CRITERION: subtlety

    SCORE: 0.73

    EVIDENCE: Strong subtlety: "He thought of Marianne''s roses, the ones he''d let
    go to seed because pruning them alone felt like admitting something." Weak subtlety:
    "The route had protected him from the finality of stone" (direct exposition) and
    "his feet had never carried him" (slightly on-the-nose).

    FEEDBACK: You excel at conveying emotion through physical detail—the knee pop,
    the shallow breath, the weight in his chest. But occasionally you tell us interpretations
    that the reader could discover. Remove "The route had protected him from the finality
    of stone"—let us understand his avoidance through his behavior (eyes fixed on
    pavement, breath shallow) without the explanation. Similarly, "pruning them alone
    felt like admitting something" works because it''s vague and specific to Teddy.
    Consider whether he needs to speak the word "Marianne" so directly, or if her
    presence could remain more ghostly throughout.


    ---


    CRITERION: narrative_quality

    SCORE: 0.82

    EVIDENCE: Excellent: "her key ring singing its four-note song," "measured in memories
    rather than footsteps," the Ohio-shaped crack motif, "wrestling a grapevine that
    had swallowed a fence." Solid: the final image of stepping over the crack.

    FEEDBACK: Your prose is controlled and evocative. The Ohio crack is a particularly
    strong recurring image that grounds abstraction in specificity. However, watch
    for moments of over-elegance: "The house where his daughter took her first steps,
    now a yoga studio" feels slightly compressed—the emotional weight could expand
    slightly here. Also, "the unfamiliar weight of a yes settling in his chest" is
    excellent but borders on purple; ensure metaphors earn their keep through specificity.
    The ending is genuinely moving, but consider whether the final line would resonate
    even more if we saw him physically continue walking past the cemetery gate, not
    just past the crack.


    ---


    OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:


    This is a accomplished, emotionally intelligent story that satisfies all technical
    requirements and offers genuine prose beauty. Your greatest strengths are constraint
    satisfaction and the specific, loving detail of Teddy''s routine. The primary
    opportunity for growth lies in deepening Teddy''s interiority—especially the conflict
    between his desire for safety and his buried hunger for connection—and trusting
    your readers to infer meaning rather than stating it. With these revisions, this
    story could move from solidly competent to resonant.'

    SCORE: 0.68\nEVIDENCE: \"Some mornings he wondered what it would feel like to\
    \ step off the path. But the seventh step always brought him back.\" and \"the\
    \ unfamiliar weight of a yes settling in his chest\"\nFEEDBACK: Teddy's inner\
    \ life is present but remains somewhat surface-level. You show us WHAT he feels\
    \ (the weight, the wondering) but rarely WHY. His relationship with Marianne,\
    \ his connection to his daughter, and his actual emotional state regarding grief\
    \ remain largely unexplored. Consider deepening moments like his reaction to learning\
    \ about Sarah's grandmother. What specific memory does it trigger? Does he think\
    \ about his daughter? The most powerful interiority would involve competing emotions—fear\
    \ and desire, guilt and hope—not just single feelings. Add a moment where Teddy's\
    \ thoughts contradict his actions, revealing internal conflict.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION:\
    \ constraint_satisfaction\nSCORE: 0.93\nEVIDENCE: All five constraints present—(1)\
    \ Routine: \"At 6:42 AM, he passed the Chen family's coffee shop, where Mrs. Chen\
    \ always unlocked the door, her key ring singing its four-note song\"; (2) Disruption/avoidance\
    \ revealed: \"he'd avoided for eight years. Marianne's plot waited there, but\
    \ his feet had never carried him\"; (3) Neighbor intersection: Sarah with her\
    \ grandmother's house parallels his loss; (4) Absence of wife: Marianne referenced\
    \ through the library, the roses, the meet-cute location; (5) New path offers:\
    \ \"the river, something he hadn't seen in forty years\" and human connection\n\
    FEEDBACK: Excellent constraint satisfaction. Your only potential weakness is that\
    \ Sarah's parallel to Teddy could be more carefully woven. Right now the connection\
    \ feels slightly explained (\"The past doesn't let go easy\") rather than discovered.\
    \ Consider having Sarah mention something specific about her grandmother's death\
    \ that echoes Teddy's experience before he consciously recognizes the parallel.\n\
    \n---\n\nCRITERION: beat_execution\nSCORE: 0.72\nEVIDENCE: You (established immediately);\
    \ Need (less clear—Teddy doesn't have an active want until Sarah appears); Go\
    \ (the detour forces him into unfamiliar territory); Search (he attempts to help,\
    \ steps over the crack)\nFEEDBACK: The Story Circle is present but the \"Need\"\
    \ beat is the weakest link. Teddy is *acted upon* by the construction rather than\
    \ *wanting something*. The story would strengthen if Teddy had an internal desire\
    \ before the detour—perhaps he's aware of his stagnation and the route is suffocating\
    \ him, even subconsciously. This would make his \"yes\" to Sarah feel like an\
    \ active choice rather than passive acceptance. Currently, the arc reads as: disrupted\
    \ routine → accident of exposure → acceptance. Stronger would be: trapped in routine\
    \ → forced confrontation → *chooses* connection.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: subtlety\n\
    SCORE: 0.73\nEVIDENCE: Strong subtlety: \"He thought of Marianne's roses, the\
    \ ones he'd let go to seed because pruning them alone felt like admitting something.\"\
    \ Weak subtlety: \"The route had protected him from the finality of stone\" (direct\
    \ exposition) and \"his feet had never carried him\" (slightly on-the-nose).\n\
    FEEDBACK: You excel at conveying emotion through physical detail—the knee pop,\
    \ the shallow breath, the weight in his chest. But occasionally you tell us interpretations\
    \ that the reader could discover. Remove \"The route had protected him from the\
    \ finality of stone\"—let us understand his avoidance through his behavior (eyes\
    \ fixed on pavement, breath shallow) without the explanation. Similarly, \"pruning\
    \ them alone felt like admitting something\" works because it's vague and specific\
    \ to Teddy. Consider whether he needs to speak the word \"Marianne\" so directly,\
    \ or if her presence could remain more ghostly throughout.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION:\
    \ narrative_quality\nSCORE: 0.82\nEVIDENCE: Excellent: \"her key ring singing\
    \ its four-note song,\" \"measured in memories rather than footsteps,\" the Ohio-shaped\
    \ crack motif, \"wrestling a grapevine that had swallowed a fence.\" Solid: the\
    \ final image of stepping over the crack.\nFEEDBACK: Your prose is controlled\
    \ and evocative. The Ohio crack is a particularly strong recurring image that\
    \ grounds abstraction in specificity. However, watch for moments of over-elegance:\
    \ \"The house where his daughter took her first steps, now a yoga studio\" feels\
    \ slightly compressed—the emotional weight could expand slightly here. Also, \"\
    the unfamiliar weight of a yes settling in his chest\" is excellent but borders\
    \ on purple; ensure metaphors earn their keep through specificity. The ending\
    \ is genuinely moving, but consider whether the final line would resonate even\
    \ more if we saw him physically continue walking past the cemetery gate, not just\
    \ past the crack.\n\n---\n\nOVERALL_ASSESSMENT:\n\nThis is a accomplished, emotionally\
    \ intelligent story that satisfies all technical requirements and offers genuine\
    \ prose beauty. Your greatest strengths are constraint satisfaction and the specific,\
    \ loving detail of Teddy's routine. The primary opportunity for growth lies in\
    \ deepening Teddy's interiority—especially the conflict between his desire for\
    \ safety and his buried hunger for connection—and trusting your readers to infer\
    \ meaning rather than stating it. With these revisions, this story could move\
    \ from solidly competent to resonant.\n\nRevise your story to address ALL critique\
    \ points while preserving what worked well.\nFocus on the specific issues identified.\n\

    He listened for it the way other men listened for the weather report—confirmation
    that the world was still turning. At 6:42 AM, he passed the Chen family''s coffee
    shop, where Mrs. Chen always unlocked the door, her key ring singing its four-note
    song. By 6:51, he reached the crack on Maple that looked like Ohio, a shape he''d
    studied since 1984.


    Three miles exactly, measured in memories rather than footsteps. The house where
    his daughter took her first steps, now a yoga studio. The library where he''d
    met Marianne, its windows boarded. He''d walked this loop for eight years. The
    sidewalk knew his footsteps better than he knew himself. Some mornings he wondered
    what it would feel like to step off the path. But the seventh step always brought
    him back.


    On Tuesday, the "Street Closed" sign appeared on Jefferson. A plywood wall with
    a permit expiring in November. Six months. The foreman shrugged. "Water main,
    pops. Gotta go around."


    The detour took him past St. Agnes Cemetery, a place he''d avoided for eight years.
    Her plot waited there. He walked faster, eyes fixed on the pavement, his breath
    shallow. He didn''t look at the headstones.


    On unfamiliar pavement, a community garden sprawled where a parking lot used to
    be. A woman his daughter''s age wrestled a grapevine that had swallowed a fence.
    She wore a Detroit Tigers cap backward.


    "Morning," Teddy said, surprised by his own voice.


    She looked up. "You''re the guy who walks by at 6:47. Like clockwork."


    He stepped backward, as if distance might make him invisible. "Construction,"
    he explained.


    "Yeah, they''re tearing up the whole block." She stood, cracking her back. "I''m
    Sarah. Trying to save my grandmother''s house. The one with the purple door."


    He knew it. A Victorian they''d called an eyesore. Now it was "historic."


    "She died last year," Sarah continued. "Left me this place and a mortgage I can''t
    afford. Making it a bed-and-breakfast, but..." She gestured at the vine. "The
    past doesn''t let go easy. My daughter keeps asking when we can visit her grave.
    I keep saying soon."


    Teddy''s throat tightened. His own daughter lived in Seattle now. She called every
    Sunday, asking when he''d visit. He always said soon.


    "I could help," he said. The words surprised him as much as Sarah. "With the vines.
    Used to be good with my hands."


    Sarah studied him. "Tomorrow? Same time?"


    He nodded. The unfamiliar weight settled in his chest—not of yes, but of choice.
    The new route home took him past the river, something he hadn''t seen in forty
    years. At the corner of 3rd and Maple, he paused at the Ohio-shaped crack. Then
    he stepped over it and kept walking, past the cemetery gate, toward whatever came
    next. '

  content: 'Teddy Washington''s left knee popped on the seventh step every morning.
    He listened for it the way other men listened for the weather report—confirmation
    that the world was still turning. At 6:42 AM, he passed the Chen family''s coffee
    shop, where Mrs. Chen always unlocked the door, her key ring singing its four-note
    song. By 6:51, he reached the crack on Maple that looked like Ohio, a shape he''d
    studied since 1984.


    Three miles exactly, measured in memories rather than footsteps. The house where
    his daughter took her first steps, now a yoga studio. The library where he''d
    met Marianne, its windows boarded. He''d walked this loop for eight years. Some
    mornings he stood at his window and watched his own feet move, as if they belonged
    to someone else. His daughter called every Sunday from Seattle, asking when he''d
    visit. He always said soon, and meant it, but his feet never carried him to the
    airport. He told himself he was preserving memories, but the truth was simpler:
    the route was safe.


    On Tuesday, the "Street Closed" sign appeared on Jefferson. A plywood wall with
    a permit expiring in November. Six months. The foreman shrugged. "Water main,
    pops. Gotta go around."


    The detour took him past St. Agnes Cemetery, a place he''d avoided for eight years.
    Her plot waited there, number 47-B, under the oak. He walked faster, eyes fixed
    on the pavement, his breath shallow. The air tasted of cut grass and iron. Marianne''s
    laughter used to echo in their hallway when he''d come home from work, that particular
    laugh she saved just for him. Now it was just his own footsteps.


    On unfamiliar pavement, a community garden sprawled where a parking lot used to
    be. A woman his daughter''s age wrestled a grapevine that had swallowed a fence.
    She wore a Detroit Tigers cap backward.


    "Morning," Teddy said, surprised by his own voice.


    She looked up. "You''re the guy who walks by at 6:47. Like clockwork."


    He stepped backward, as if distance might make him invisible. "Construction,"
    he explained.


    "Yeah, they''re tearing up the whole block." She stood, cracking her back. "I''m
    Sarah. Trying to save my grandmother''s house. The one with the purple door."


    He knew it. A Victorian they''d called an eyesore. Now it was "historic."


    "She died last year," Sarah continued. "Left me this place and a mortgage I can''t
    afford. Making it a bed-and-breakfast, but..." She gestured at the vine. "'

output: 'Teddy Washington''s left knee popped on the seventh step every morning. He
  listened for it the way other men listened for the weather report—confirmation that
  the world was still turning. At 6:42 AM, he passed the Chen family''s coffee shop,
  where Mrs. Chen always unlocked the door, her key ring singing its four-note song.
  By 6:51, he reached the crack on Maple that looked like Ohio, a shape he''d studied
  since 1984.


  Three miles exactly, measured in memories rather than footsteps. The house where
  his daughter took her first steps, now a yoga studio. The library where he''d met
  Marianne, its windows boarded. He''d walked this loop for eight years. Some mornings
  he stood at his window and watched his own feet move, as if they belonged to someone
  else. His daughter called every Sunday from Seattle, asking when he''d visit. He
  always said soon, and meant it, but his feet never carried him to the airport. He
  told himself he was preserving memories, but the truth was simpler: the route was
  safe.


  On Tuesday, the "Street Closed" sign appeared on Jefferson. A plywood wall with
  a permit expiring in November. Six months. The foreman shrugged. "Water main, pops.
  Gotta go around."


  The detour took him past St. Agnes Cemetery, a place he''d avoided for eight years.
  Her plot waited there, number 47-B, under the oak. He walked faster, eyes fixed
  on the pavement, his breath shallow. The air tasted of cut grass and iron. Marianne''s
  laughter used to echo in their hallway when he''d come home from work, that particular
  laugh she saved just for him. Now it was just his own footsteps.
