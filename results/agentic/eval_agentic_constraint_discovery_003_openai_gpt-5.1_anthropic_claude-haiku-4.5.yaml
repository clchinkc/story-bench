  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The 5 questions successfully uncovered 3 of 5 hidden
    constraints: (1) romantic past connection (Q1: YES), (2) bookshop financial crisis
    (Q5: YES), (3) tone should be bittersweet not cozy (Q5: NO). MISSED: The 20-year
    separation timeline, the mother''s dementia, the former fiancé/mayor detail, and
    the 2-week festival deadline as the critical save window. Questions were reasonably
    strategic but lacked specificity about temporal elements, family health crises,
    and the protagonist''s departure reason. Coverage was adequate but didn''t probe
    family dynamics or specific catalysts for return. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: The
    output incorporates the bookshop foreclosure crisis well and establishes romantic
    history with Nate. However, critical gaps exist: (1) Mother''s dementia is completely
    absent—only mentioned as ''death two months ago,'' eliminating the emotional anchor
    for Emma''s return; (2) The 20-year timeline is never explicitly stated (references
    suggest it but lack clarity); (3) Nate''s role as mayor is never established—he''s
    a lawyer/counsel, not the political figure; (4) The 2-week festival deadline is
    present but underutilized as urgency driver. BEAT EXECUTION: The core romance
    arc executes well—reunion, conflict, reconciliation through moral choice. The
    bookshop save attempt is present. However, the mother subplot is fundamentally
    broken (she''s dead, not living with dementia), which was likely the emotional
    core of why Emma returned. This is a major structural failure. NARRATIVE QUALITY:
    The prose is genuinely strong—evocative sensory details, good pacing, authentic
    dialogue, and a satisfying emotional climax where Nate makes his choice. The story
    works as a standalone romance but fails to integrate the hidden constraints that
    would have deepened it. The ending is hopeful-uncertain rather than bittersweet,
    slightly misaligned with the tone constraint answer.'
