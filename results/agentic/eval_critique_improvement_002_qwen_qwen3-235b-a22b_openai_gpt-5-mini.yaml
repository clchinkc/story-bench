  evidence: Early feedback (Critique 3) flagged a missing story; subsequent revisions
    supplied full text and addressed other weaknesses. Version 0 introduced the premise
    and characters but felt thin on emotional stakes. Version 1 tightened voice and
    added more industry detail. The Final Revised Story deepened Marcus's pathos (antidepressants,
    dive bar memory), added a clear theme stated by a minor character (Kevin), and
    showed comedy craft with concrete specifics (circling the punchline, red-pen edits,
    sitcom template, vegan queso gag). The near-break moment (shaking hand/forced
    smile) and the cover-with-joke beat were added/clarified. Across rounds, humor
    and industry authenticity were preserved while emotional complexity and character
    interplay were strengthened.
