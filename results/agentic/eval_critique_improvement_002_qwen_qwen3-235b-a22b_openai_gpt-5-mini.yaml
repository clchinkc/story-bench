  evidence: 'Initial critiques flagged that the story text was missing. Version 0
    showed a skeletal opening gag and a hint of Marcus''s sadness; by Version 3 and
    the final output the author added a clear Theme Stated (Darryl), a Catalyst (Zoe),
    a focused "Craft" section that demonstrates comedic technique, and an explicit
    near-break moment where Marcus covers his crack with a joke. Across revisions
    humor and craft were preserved while emotional beats were deepened (Zoe sees through
    Marcus; Marcus''s brittle laughs remain). Weaknesses remaining: not all Save the
    Cat beats are fully developed (we have Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst and
    a few scene beats but lack a full arc through Midpoint/All-Is-Lost/Finale), and
    some transitions feel episodic rather than a fully integrated plot. Overall quality
    improved noticeably from a sketch to a textured scene that satisfies the five
    constraints but only partially executes the full beat structure.'
