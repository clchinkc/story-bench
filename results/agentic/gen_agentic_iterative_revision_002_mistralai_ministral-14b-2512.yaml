    **Title: "The Hum of the City"**


    The morning sun slithered through Imani Torres’s open curtain, painting her cramped
    Brooklyn apartment in uneven streaks of gold and heat. She didn’t see it, but
    she felt it—the way the air thickened against her skin, the rhythmic *thump* of
    a construction worker’s hammer against the pavement two floors below, the distant
    wail of a siren, swallowed by the block before it could fully form. From her perch
    on the cushioned couch, Imani adjusted her headphones and let the sounds of the
    gentrifying neighborhood filter through her mind like a familiar symphony. The
    *sizzle* of a street cart griddle, the murmur of Spanish from the bodega owner
    arranging his latest delivery, the creak of her neighbor’s rocking chair as he
    shifted from foot to foot, waiting for his coffee to cool.


    “Good morning, Brooklyn,” Imani murmured into the mic, her voice steady, warm.
    “It’s your girl, Imani Torres, and today we’re diving into the case of *The Echo
    Chamber Killer*—a murderer whose crimes were only uncovered because he left one
    thing behind: silence.”


    The opening of her show always mirrored the city’s own waking pulse. The *clang*
    of the subway grate as the L train rumbled past, the shouts of kids playing hopscotch,
    the occasional laugh—all of it woven into her narration. But today, something
    was different. The usual hum of activity felt *off*. Beneath the vendor’s Spanish,
    she heard a note of tension, like the stretched strings of a guitar. A woman’s
    voice, too soft, arguing with a man who snapped back, sharp and fast. Then, the
    unmistakable sound of glass breaking.


    Imani’s fingers hovered over her keyboard. “Hold that thought,” she said, pausing
    the recording. She pressed her palm to the wooden floor and listened. The apartment
    was quiet now, except for the faint *drip… drip… drip* of her air conditioner.
    The neighbor’s chair had gone still. The construction had stopped. Even the siren
    was absent.


    Her pulse quickened. That wasn’t an accident. She’d heard glass breaking before—backstage
    at a comedy club, the shatter of a bottle during a fight. But this had the quiet
    *finality* of something deliberate.


    Imani pulled off her headphones and gripped the cane beside her. She counted her
    steps to the door, three swift taps against the floor. The hallway smelled of
    disinfectant and takeout—someone had just passed. She knocked on the door opposite
    hers.


    No answer.


    She tried again, louder. “Mr. Chen? Imani. I heard something.”


    A long pause. Then, the shuffle of feet. The door creaked open, just enough for
    a line of light to spill in. “You hear too much, Imani.”


    She smiled despite herself. “That’s my job. What did you hear?”


    His sigh was heavy, tired. “A man. Yelling. Then…” He hesitated. “Then nothing.”


    “Nothing?” She tilted her head, as if that could help her see the way his voice
    dropped. “No more yelling? No footsteps?”


    “Just…” His voice cracked. “Just silence.”


    Silence. That’s what had stopped her breath.


    She had been researching *The Echo Chamber Killer*, a serial who’d taunted police
    with white noise before his strikes, masking the sounds of his victims’ last moments.
    The case had been decades cold, but Imani had pieced together the pattern—always
    a pause before the scream, always a moment of eerie quiet. She’d even replicated
    that pause in her show’s intro, just a breath, a hesitation, before the music
    cut in.


    “Imani,” Mr. Chen said, his tone urgent now. “You don’t think—?”


    “No.” She forced calm into her voice, though her hands trembled around her cane.
    “But let’s call the precinct. Just in case.”


    As he dialed, she listened. The line hummed, static like the distant white noise
    of a bad radio station. And then—there it was, again. A faint *beep… beep… beep*,
    buried beneath the clatter of the precinct’s busy switchboard, the rattle of Mr.
    Chen’s keys.


    Imani’s breath hitched. That wasn’t a phone. It was a *watch*. A cheap digital
    one, the kind that beeped every minute. She’d heard that sound in her research,
    too—the killer’s signal, the moment before he struck.


    The precinct line clicked dead. “They’re sending someone,” Mr. Chen said.


    Imani nodded, though he couldn’t see it. “Lock your door. And don’t answer it.”


    She had to get to the stairs. Five steps down, her cane found the third one’s
    loose board. She’d noticed that last week, when the superintendant barked about
    the noise. *Fix the damn stairs.* The man had meant it as an insult. Now, it was
    a warning.


    The door at the bottom of the hall banged open. She heard the *scuffle* of shoes
    on tile, the rush of wind, the heavy *thud* of a body hitting her neighbor’s wall.


    “Mr. Chen!” she screamed, sprinting forward. Her cane caught the edge of the doorframe—*clang*—and
    she was inside, the apartment dark except for the thin slash of light from the
    window. She reached out, fingers brushing the coffee table, the rocker’s armrest,
    and then—warmth. A body. “Mr. Chen, are you—”


    “Don’t move.” The voice was a rasp, close. Too close.


    Imani froze. She hadn’t heard him come in. But she’d heard his breath—the quick,
    uneven inhale of someone scared or guilty. Or both.


    She exhaled slowly, counting the seconds. One. Two. Three. On the fourth, she
    dropped her cane. It hit the floor with a sharp *clatter*, then rolled toward
    the window.


    A pause. Then, the faint *beep… beep… beep* of that damn watch.


    She didn’t wait. She lunged for the rocker, grabbed it, and swung. The metal armrest
    connected with a wet *thunk*. A curse. Footsteps, hurried, retreating.


    Imani gasped, her heart hammering. The *click* of a doorknob turning—then the
    slam of the door. She didn’t move, didn’t dare. The apartment was still. No more
    beeping. No more silence.


    Only the sound of her own ragged breathing, and Mr. Chen’s voice from the floor.
    “Imani…?”


    She dropped to her knees beside him. His blood, thick and coppery, soaked her
    hands. “Oh, Mr. Chen,” she whispered.


    The sirens were coming. Closer now. And in the hallway, the *thump… thump… thump*
    of her cane, dropped in the rush, signaling her to the police.


    She had failed to save him. But she’d heard the truth.


    And the hum of the city had finally spoken back.'

    **"The Hum of the City"**


    The humid Brooklyn summer pressed against Imani Torres’s skin like a damp blanket,
    thick with the scent of concrete dust and diesel fumes from the bodega truck parked
    downstairs. Her apartment was alive with sound—Mr. Chen’s morning *thump-thump-thump*
    as he carried his groceries up two flights, the rhythmic *creak-scrape* of her
    neighbor’s rocking chair, the occasional *squeak* of a pigeon taking flight. The
    *drip… drip… drip* of her air conditioner kept time, steady and familiar, as she
    adjusted her headphones. The familiar *clang* of the subway grate was missing—too
    early for the L train. Instead, there was the sharp, metallic *ping* of a dropped
    fork from the diner down the block, the distant *honking* of a cab driver impatient
    with summer traffic, and the faint, rhythmic *thunk* of a basketball being dribbled
    against pavement.


    “Good morning, Brooklyn,” Imani said into her mic, her voice warm but measured.
    “It’s your girl, Imani Torres, and today we’re diving into *The Echo Chamber Killer*—a
    case that’s haunted me since I first heard it. You see, this murderer didn’t just
    erase his victims. He erased the sound of them struggling, too. White noise. A
    tool to mask the truth.”


    She paused, listening. The apartment was alive with the sounds of her research—the
    *swish* of her mouse scrolling through old transcripts, the *tap-tap-tap* of her
    fingers on the keyboard, the faint *static* of a police scanner playing in the
    background. But outside, the city was different. The usual *whir* of the ice cream
    truck had vanished. The bodega’s door creaked shut, an unusual sound in the middle
    of a delivery. Imani’s nose twitched at the sharp, metallic tang of blood beneath
    the ever-present summer smells.


    Something was wrong.


    She pulled off the headphones and set them aside. The *click* of the mic stand
    locking into place was the only sound for a moment. Then, the apartment door handle
    *twisted* with a faint *squeak*—not the usual *whoosh* of her neighbor returning
    from his walk. The door didn’t open or close. It just… hung there.


    Imani’s fingers gripped her cane. She counted the steps to the door—*one, two,
    three*—and stopped. Her ears strained. The creak of the rocker had gone still.
    No hum from Mr. Chen’s TV, no footsteps in the hallway. Just the *drip… drip…
    drip* of her air conditioner, growing louder in the silence.


    “Hello?” she called out, her voice echoing in the empty hallway.


    No answer.


    She reached for the door, her hands finding the cool brass of the doorknob. She
    turned it slowly, her breath caught in her throat. The door swung open, the hinges
    groaning. A gust of air rushed in, carrying the sharp scent of blood, the faint
    *static* of someone breathing heavily in the hallway.


    Imani’s pulse quickened. She had heard that sound before—a case she’d covered
    last year. A man standing too close, his breath uneven. She stepped back, the
    door slamming shut behind her. The handle *twisted* again, the lock *clicking*
    into place.


    “Who’s there?” she asked, her voice steady. She had spent years training herself
    to stay calm in moments like this, when the lack of visual cues made the world
    feel unfamiliar.


    No answer. Only the *thunk* of footsteps, retreating down the hall. She listened
    carefully—three steps, then a pause. Then, the faint *beep… beep… beep* of a digital
    watch, the kind that sounded every sixty seconds.


    Imani smiled. She knew that sound. It wasn’t the usual *beep* of a watch—it was
    the hesitation before the silence. That’s what she had heard in the old transcripts,
    the *beep* that signaled the killer’s moment before he struck.


    “Thank you,” she whispered into the empty hallway.


    She had to get to the stairs. *One, two, three*—her cane found the loose board
    on the third step. She had heard that sound before, too—the loose plank that creaked
    under her weight every time she descended. It was a pattern. A clue.


    At the bottom of the stairs, she listened. The *whoosh* of the door opening at
    the floor below. The *scuffle* of shoes on tile. The heavy, wet *thud* of a body
    hitting the wall.


    Imani’s breath hitched. Glass shattered somewhere upstairs. A woman’s voice, too
    soft to hear clearly. But the silence that followed was deafening.


    She didn’t move. She didn’t breathe. Only the faint *beep… beep… beep* of that
    watch shattered the quiet.


    Imani’s fingers curled around her cane. The sounds of the city were coming alive
    again—the distant *honking* of a cab, the *sizzle* of the street cart griddle,
    the *clang* of the subway grate. The usual chaos.


    But now, she heard something new. The *click* of a phone being dialed.


    She sprinted up the stairs, her cane banging against the railing. The door above
    her creaked open. She reached out, her fingers brushing the cold brass of the
    doorknob.


    “Don’t move.”


    The voice was a rasp, close. Too close. But she had heard it before—the hesitation.
    The moment before the silence.


    Imani didn’t move. She didn’t breathe. She just listened.


    She heard the man’s breath—the quick, uneven inhale of someone scared or guilty.
    The faint *beep* of his watch, growing louder. The *click* of a lighter being
    struck, the *whoosh* of a flame.


    And then, the *thunk* of a match being dropped into a glass.


    The silence that followed was a wall. The sound of Mr. Chen’s blood hitting the
    floor was a distant echo.


    But the city’s hum was back. And Imani knew she had to act.


    She dropped her cane, the *clatter* of it hitting the floor signaling her position
    to the police. She lunged for the rocker, grabbed it, and swung. The metal armrest
    connected with a wet *thunk*. A curse. Footsteps, retreating.


    Imani hit the ground, her hands soaked with Mr. Chen’s blood. The *drip… drip…
    drip* of her air conditioner was the only sound in the apartment.


    The sirens were coming. The city’s chaos growing louder.


    Imani had heard the truth. And she had saved herself.


    But Mr. Chen was gone. And the silence he had left behind was a reminder that
    some truths could never be fully uncovered.'

    The first thing Imani Torres noticed when she woke was the absence. No clatter
    of the bodega owner stacking crates outside her window. No rhythmic *thump-thump*
    of Mr. Chen’s cane on the sidewalk as he made his morning rounds. Just the steady
    *drip-drip-drip* of her leaky faucet and the distant, muffled *whoosh* of the
    L train passing under her building—too early for the rush hour crowd.


    She rolled onto her side, the sheets still warm from her body heat. The hum of
    her apartment’s old AC unit vibrated against her back, a constant white noise
    she barely registered anymore. She reached for her phone on the nightstand, the
    familiar *tap* of her finger on the screen lighting up the quiet.


    "Morning, Brooklyn," she murmured into her voice memo app, already in character.
    "It''s Imani Torres, and today we''re talking about cases that *should* have been
    solved decades ago. The kind where the evidence was right there—but no one was
    listening."


    She wasn’t recording for her show yet. Just testing her mic, her voice. The way
    it filled the small space, warm and sure. She had spent years perfecting that
    tone—calm, engaging, the kind that made listeners lean in whether they meant to
    or not.


    Her stomach growled. Time for coffee. She swung her legs over the side of the
    bed, her bare feet hitting the cool hardwood. The apartment smelled like yesterday’s
    takeout—garlic and soy sauce—and the faint, musky scent of her neighbor’s incense
    from down the hall.


    The *click* of her cane against the floor as she stood was the only sound for
    a moment. Then—there it was. The unmistakable *creak* of the hallway door opening.
    Not Mr. Chen’s heavy, deliberate steps. This was lighter. Faster. A man’s shoes,
    maybe, the *scuff* of the sole against the linoleum.


    Imani froze. She hadn’t heard that sound in months. Not since the last time she’d
    had a visitor unannounced.


    "Hello?" she called out, keeping her voice light. "Who''s there?"


    No answer. Just the faint *hum* of the building’s electrical system, the distant
    *beep* of a car alarm being triggered somewhere on the street.


    She moved toward the door, her cane tapping out a steady rhythm. Three steps to
    the door. Four to the left to the peephole. She pressed her eye to the small circle
    of glass, listening for the *click* of the mechanism as she turned it.


    Nothing.


    The door was already unlocked.


    Imani’s breath hitched. That wasn’t possible. She always locked it after her last
    walk with her service dog, Luna, who had passed last winter.


    She reached for the doorknob, her fingers brushing the cool metal. The door swung
    open with a soft *whoosh*, the hinges groaning just enough to announce her presence.


    The hallway was empty. The *creak* of the rocker from Mr. Chen’s apartment was
    gone. No sound of the TV he always left on during the day. Just the faint *drip*
    of water from the neighbor’s leaky pipe and the distant *honking* of a cab.


    Imani stepped out, her cane finding the edge of the doorframe. She listened carefully.
    The *thump* of construction from the building across the street had stopped. No
    laughter from the kids playing hopscotch on the sidewalk. Just the *whir* of the
    streetlamp fan above her, spinning lazily in the still summer air.


    Something was wrong.


    She turned back toward her apartment, her fingers brushing the wall for the light
    switch. The *click* as she flipped it on filled the hallway with a sudden brightness
    she didn’t need. She could feel the warmth on her skin, the way the air shimmered
    with heat.


    Her phone buzzed in her pocket. A text from her producer: *"You good? Heard you’re
    running late."*


    Imani exhaled. She needed to focus. She pulled out her phone and opened her notes
    app, scrolling through her research on *The Echo Chamber Killer*—a case she’d
    been obsessed with for months. The killer had left no physical evidence, no fingerprints,
    no DNA. But he had left something else. A pattern.


    She replayed the audio files she’d collected from old police interviews, listening
    for the telltale *beep* of a digital watch—the one sound that always preceded
    the murders. The victims had described it as a "moment of silence," but Imani
    knew better. It was a signal. A countdown.


    Her phone buzzed again. This time it was a call from the precinct. Detective Rivera.


    "Imani," the detective’s voice was gruff, no-nonsense. "We’ve got a situation
    at Mr. Chen’s. You need to come down."


    Imani’s stomach dropped. "Is he—?"


    "Just get down here. Now."


    She ended the call and turned toward the stairs. The *creak* of the first step
    was familiar, the loose board she’d reported a dozen times now groaning under
    her weight.


    As she descended, she listened carefully. The *thump* of her heart in her ears.
    The *drip* of water from the leaky pipe above her. And then—there it was. The
    faint *beep… beep… beep* of a digital watch.


    Imani stopped. She closed her eyes, letting the sound fill her completely. It
    was the same rhythm from the old case files. The same hesitation before the silence.


    She reached into her pocket and pulled out her recorder. She pressed record and
    held it up, listening.


    The *beep* continued, steady and unmistakable. Then, the sound of footsteps. Quick.
    Light. Retreating.


    Imani’s fingers tightened around her cane. She had heard this before. The killer’s
    signature. The moment before he struck.


    She started running down the stairs, her cane banging against the railing. The
    *thunk* of her shoes on the concrete steps echoed in the stairwell.


    At the bottom, she skidded to a stop. The hallway was empty. The door to Mr. Chen’s
    apartment was ajar, the *creak* of the hinges barely audible.


    She stepped forward, her fingers brushing the doorframe. The apartment was dark,
    the only light coming from the hallway. She could feel the cool air conditioning
    humming, the faint scent of Mr. Chen’s incense still lingering.


    Then she heard it—the *drip* of water. Not from the pipe. From something else.


    She moved forward, her cane tapping out a steady rhythm. The *thunk* of her shoe
    against the floor. The *creak* of the rocker as she brushed past it.


    And then she saw it.


    Mr. Chen’s body lay crumpled on the floor, the *drip-drip-drip* of blood pooling
    beneath him. The *beep* of the watch was louder now, closer. She followed the
    sound to the kitchen, where the killer stood, his back to her, his hand raised
    to his mouth.


    Imani’s breath caught. She had heard this before, too. The killer’s final signal.
    The moment before he erased all sound.


    She dropped her cane, the *clatter* of it hitting the floor signaling her position
    to the police. She lunged for the rocker, grabbed it, and swung. The metal armrest
    connected with a wet *thunk*. A curse. Footsteps, retreating.


    Imani hit the ground, her hands soaked with Mr. Chen’s blood. The *drip-drip-drip*
    of the faucet was the only sound in the apartment.


    The sirens were coming. The city’s chaos growing louder.


    Imani had heard the truth. And she had saved herself.


    But Mr. Chen was gone. And the silence he had left behind was a reminder that
    some truths could never be fully uncovered.


    She pulled out her phone and pressed record. "This," she said, her voice steady,
    "is for the show."'

    **"The Hum of the City"**


    The first thing Imani Torres noticed when she woke was the absence. No clatter
    of the bodega owner stacking crates outside her window. No rhythmic *thump-thump*
    of Mr. Chen’s cane on the sidewalk as he made his morning rounds. Just the steady
    *drip-drip-drip* of her leaky faucet and the distant, muffled *whoosh* of the
    L train passing under her building—too early for the rush hour crowd.


    She rolled onto her side, the sheets still warm from her body heat. The hum of
    her apartment’s old AC unit vibrated against her back, a constant white noise
    she barely registered anymore. She reached for her phone on the nightstand, the
    familiar *tap* of her finger on the screen lighting up the quiet.


    "Morning, Brooklyn," she murmured into her voice memo app, already in character.
    "It''s Imani Torres, and today we''re talking about cases that *should* have been
    solved decades ago. The kind where the evidence was right there—but no one was
    listening."


    She wasn’t recording for her show yet. Just testing her mic, her voice. The way
    it filled the small space, warm and sure. She had spent years perfecting that
    tone—calm, engaging, the kind that made listeners lean in whether they meant to
    or not.


    Her stomach growled. Time for coffee. She swung her legs over the side of the
    bed, her bare feet hitting the cool hardwood. The apartment smelled like yesterday’s
    takeout—garlic and soy sauce—and the faint, musky scent of her neighbor’s incense
    from down the hall.


    The *click* of her cane against the floor as she stood was the only sound for
    a moment. Then—there it was. The unmistakable *creak* of the hallway door opening.
    Not Mr. Chen’s heavy, deliberate steps. This was lighter. Faster. A man’s shoes,
    maybe, the *scuff* of the sole against the linoleum.


    Imani froze. She hadn’t heard that sound in months. Not since the last time she’d
    had a visitor unannounced.


    "Hello?" she called out, keeping her voice light. "Who''s there?"


    No answer. Just the faint *hum* of the ...

    **"The Hum of the City"**


    Imani Torres woke to the sharp, metallic *ting* of her phone alarm cutting through
    the usual summer symphony of her 1-bedroom Brooklyn apartment. The air conditioning’s
    *whir* pulsed against her sheets, still damp from last night’s humidity—her pillows
    smelled faintly of lavender, her own dry shampoo, and the lingering cigarette
    smoke from her neighbor across the hall. She rolled onto her side, her fingers
    brushing the raised stitching on her favorite pillowcase, and immediately detected
    the subtle change: the *drip-drip-drip* of her leaky faucet was missing.


    *"No AC condensation?"* She frowned.


    Her dog, Luna, had been gone six months, replaced by the rhythmic *snick-snick*
    of her electric teakettle as it heated to precisely 212 degrees. Today’s silence
    was unsettling. She reached for her phone, the *tap-tap* of her fingers on the
    cracked ceramic surface of her nightstand sending vibrations up her arm. The screen
    lit with a soft blue glow, revealing 8:07 AM—too early for Mr. Chen’s usual *"Good
    morning, kid!"* and the clatter of his cane on the sidewalk, or the bodega owner’s
    deep *"¡Buenos días!"* as he stacked yesterday’s expired yogurt cups into the
    trash.


    The city outside was wrong.


    She swung her legs over the mattress, her bare toes curling against the rough
    wool of her rug—*scratch-scratch* as she found the fringe. The apartment smelled
    of burnt toast and the faint, cloying sweetness of *The Echo Chamber Killer* case
    file she’d left open on her desk last night. The pages had been warm, still holding
    the scent of her research, like a half-remembered dream.


    Her cane—carved rosewood with a curved metal handle—*clicked* against the floor
    as she stood. She didn’t need to see to know the kitchen’s window was fogged with
    last night’s summer air, the glass cool against her palm as she moved toward it.
    With a practiced twist of her wrist, she adjusted the latch.


    *"Why’s the window locked?"* She never locked it anymore. The breeze outside was
    different too—no usual rush of heat from the street, just the *hiss* of a far-off
    steam pipe, the *thunk-thunk-thunk* of a garbage truck’s compactor, and beneath
    it all, a strange, wet *slapping* sound, like a handprint against a wet surface.


    She froze. That wasn’t construction. That wasn’t her neighbor’s usual *creak*
    as he rearranged his record collection. That was water. And glass.


    Then came the voices: a woman’s high-pitched *"No, please—!"* cut off mid-sentence,
    followed by the low, rough growl of a man’s voice. The *squeal* of a bike tire
    against pavement. And then—nothing. Just the *beep* of a digital watch alarm,
    the kind that sounded like a cheap phone going off, six short notes in a row.


    Imani’s breath hitched. She knew that *beep*. The cold case files had taught her:
    the killer always left it. A warning. A signature. The moment before the scream
    would vanish.


    She turned, her cane finding the edge of her desk. The *tap* of her fingers as
    she opened her notes app, the *swipe* of her thumb through old interviews. She
    replayed the victim’s testimony, listening for the exact cadence: *"He was standing
    there… then I heard the beeping… and then—"*


    Six notes. Just like now.


    Her phone buzzed in her pocket—a text from her producer, Darius. *"You good? Heard
    a bike crash outside. Rivera called. Something about Mr. Chen’s. You coming?"*


    Imani didn’t answer. She moved to her door, pressing her ear against the wood.
    No distant voices, no sirens yet. Just the *drip* of the neighbor’s shower running
    in the hall, the *clink* of a coffee cup being set down on her own doorstep, and
    the faint, rhythmic *beep* of that watch.


    She counted the beats. Three more. Then the scream.


    She reached for the doorknob. Cold. Smooth. She turned it slowly, the *click*
    of the latch loud in her own ears.


    The hallway smelled of disinfectant and copper. The *drip* of her neighbor’s shower
    was gone. Replaced by the *thump* of her cane as she knocked on Mr. Chen’s door.


    No answer.


    She tried again. *"Mr. Chen? It’s Imani. You awake?"*


    A long pause. Then, footsteps. The *scuffle* of rubber-soled shoes against linoleum.
    The door opened just a crack.


    *"I told you to stop calling me, Imani,"* Rivera’s voice was rough, tired. *"I
    thought you were at the café."*


    *"I heard it,"* she said, her voice steady. *"The beeps. There’s someone here.
    And they’re waiting."*


    Rivera exhaled sharply. *"Wait—what beeps?"*


    *"The watch,"* she said. *"The killer’s signature. Six seconds. Then the scream."*


    The door swung open. Rivera’s silhouette filled the gap, his breath carrying the
    sharp scent of coffee and cigarettes. *"Imani, you’re out of line—"*


    *"You don’t hear it,"* she said, stepping forward. *"But it’s still coming. Three
    more seconds."*


    Rivera froze. His hand went to his belt.


    Then—*six short beeps.*


    A woman’s scream echoed from the kitchen, cut off abruptly by a sharp *suffle*
    of movement, the *thunk* of a body hitting the floor.


    Imani lunged, her cane forgotten as she fumbled for the light switch. *"Here—!
    Turn it off!"*


    Rivera’s flashlight beam cut across the room, revealing the killer—back turned,
    his cheap digital watch *beeping* in his hand. The *drip-drip-drip* of blood from
    the broken faucet above the sink.


    *"Don’t move!"* Rivera barked.


    The killer turned. Imani couldn’t see his face, but his breath was a ragged gasp
    against her own.


    *"You hear too much,"* he rasped.


    Rivera’s handcuffs *snap*ed shut.


    As the sirens finally reached them, Imani adjusted her headphones. The city’s
    usual chaos was back. But she could still hear the faint, rhythmic *beep* of the
    killer’s watch, now being processed as evidence.


    *"And that,"* she murmured into the mic, *"is why you never underestimate what’s
    right in front of you."*'
