  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing how each constraint
    and beat will be addressed. The output adheres very closely to the plan, particularly
    in establishing Yuki''s isolation and the alien nature of the signal. All constraints
    are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through specific behaviors (5:47 AM wake-up,
    drone delivery, service elevator, noise-canceling headphones), the alien signal
    is genuinely alien (''mathematics familiar in structure but alien in application,''
    ''periodic table arranged by properties her chemistry did not predict,'' ''seventeen
    notes, but the intervals followed no harmonic logic''), Emil serves as the unconventional
    mentor, the psychological threshold is crossed when Yuki admits her true motivation
    for xenolinguistics, and the moment of human connection is when Emil places his
    hand on her shoulder. The beats are also well-executed: the Call to Adventure
    is the encrypted message, the Refusal of the Call is her initial hesitation and
    recommendation of others, Meeting the Mentor is with Emil, and Crossing the Threshold
    is her admission and subsequent call to the project coordinator. The narrative
    quality is strong, with good pacing and character development.'
