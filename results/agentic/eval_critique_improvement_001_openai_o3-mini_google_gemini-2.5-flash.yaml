  evidence: The initial critiques focused on the 'methodical nature' constraint, which
    was consistently addressed and improved across versions. The final version successfully
    integrates all constraints, including the narrative purpose of the fog, the local
    character's secret, the hinted past case, and the decision-based ending. The prose
    quality also improved, becoming more evocative and engaging.
