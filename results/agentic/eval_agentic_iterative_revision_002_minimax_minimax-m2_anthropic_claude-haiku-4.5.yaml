  evidence: 'VERSION 0 established strong sensory foundation but lacked narrative
    completion. VERSIONS 1-2 appear incomplete (truncated text), suggesting iterative
    development toward fuller execution. FINAL OUTPUT demonstrates exceptional constraint
    satisfaction: (1) Non-visual sensory details dominate throughout—tactile (worn
    groove, dent on table), olfactory (bleach, sweat), auditory (elevator chime, cough,
    footsteps, laugh). (2) Imani''s blindness is portrayed as genuine strength—her
    audio memory ''honed by years,'' her ability to ''catalog'' sounds, her expertise
    becomes investigative tool rather than limitation. Language avoids pity: ''She
    is not defined by her blindness; it is simply another sense in her arsenal.''
    (3) Specific audio clue (elevator chime—flat, brass-tinged, lingering too long)
    becomes crucial to solving the crime; its subtle pitch variation is the breakthrough.
    (4) Mr. Alvarez clearly underestimates Imani (''shrugs,'' ''fake cheer,'' ''nothing
    ever happens here''), creating dramatic irony when his own recorded voice betrays
    him. (5) ''Fun and Games'' section (listening party, community mapping, sound
    descriptions) genuinely entertains with playful community engagement before pivoting
    to dark discovery (muffled voice, body hitting carpet, bleach smell, attempted
    break-in). The tonal shift is earned and effective. Narrative quality strengthened
    through: precise sensory language (''syllables melting on the air,'' ''tide''
    metaphor for sirens), character agency (Imani controls the investigation through
    audio), thematic coherence (sound as justice), and climactic tension (confrontation
    resolved through audio evidence). Minor weakness: the ''broadcasting'' bluff''s
    effectiveness relies on Mr. Alvarez''s quick capitulation, which could feel slightly
    rushed, though the psychological pressure is well-established.'
