  evidence: The initial versions were very short and lacked the depth needed to satisfy
    the constraints. The critiques, particularly the detailed ones, highlighted areas
    like the need for the fog to have narrative purpose and for Sarah's methodical
    nature to be shown through action. The final version successfully integrates these
    elements. For example, the fog is explicitly stated to be 'stealing evidence'
    and forcing Sarah to 'pay attention to what remained,' giving it a clear narrative
    function beyond atmosphere. Sarah's methodical nature is demonstrated through
    her detailed observations and her ability to piece together information from subtle
    cues and character reactions. The hints about her past case and the local character's
    secret are well-woven into the narrative, and the ending provides a strong moment
    of decision. The story significantly improved in length, detail, and constraint
    fulfillment from the initial sparse versions to the rich final output.
