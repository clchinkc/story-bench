  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: The final output successfully executes 4/5 constraints with
    exceptional clarity. (1) Humor lands early and hard (''Elsa''s been drinking,''
    ''emotional unavailability'' pitch) before pathos emerges—SATISFIED. (2) Pete
    articulates the theme (''make people laugh forever, but it won''t keep you warm
    at night'')—minor character delivery, SATISFIED. (3) Comedy craft is visible in
    specific detail: the COJC grid system, ''three jokes per page minimum,'' the marker
    snap as physical tell—SATISFIED. (4) Lauren sees through Marcus immediately (''reading
    him,'' holding his hand too long, refusing to laugh at the deflection)—SATISFIED.
    (5) The almost-break moment is strong (''The marker hovered. He stopped.'') but
    the recovery (''I pitch talking dog shows'') feels slightly rushed—PARTIALLY SATISFIED.


    CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Revisions show modest responsiveness. V0→V1 improved
    Marcus''s physical presence (''pacing like a deranged talk show host'' replaces
    ''maintaining eye contact''), heightening energy. However, the three critiques
    all scored emotional_complexity 0.80-0.87 and praised the same beats, yet subsequent
    versions made minimal structural changes. The writer preserved what worked rather
    than deepening based on feedback. The final output adds Lauren''s penetrating
    observation (''I watched last season...someone still cared'') which directly addresses
    critique concerns about character depth, but this appears in the final version
    only—suggesting late incorporation rather than iterative refinement.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Modest gains across revisions. V0→V1 strengthens Marcus''s
    physical comedy and vocal energy. V1→V2→V3 appear nearly identical (versions 2-3
    are truncated in the provided data, making full comparison impossible). The final
    output demonstrates clear improvement over V0 in emotional specificity (''felt
    absolutely nothing,'' ''something crack behind his sternum,'' ''hand was steadier
    than it had been in three years'') but these refinements may represent final polish
    rather than response to critique cycles. The trajectory is positive but plateaus
    early.


    PRESERVATION: Excellent. All three critiques highlighted the ''Elsa''s been drinking''
    joke and the ''emotional unavailability'' pitch as core strengths—both preserved
    verbatim and given prominent placement. The whiteboard visual, Rajesh''s reaction,
    and the formula-comedy setup all maintained. New material (Lauren''s penetrating
    questions, the marker snap, the final hand steadiness) integrates seamlessly without
    displacing working elements.


    CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:

    - Constraint 1 (laugh before sadness): ✓ SATISFIED. ''Elsa''s been drinking''
    + ''emotional unavailability'' pitch generates room laughter before Marcus''s
    internal emptiness (''felt absolutely nothing'') is revealed.

    - Constraint 2 (theme by minor character): ✓ SATISFIED. Pete delivers: ''you can
    make people laugh forever, but it won''t keep you warm at night.'' Clear thematic
    statement from non-protagonist.

    - Constraint 3 (comedy craft specificity): ✓ SATISFIED. COJC grid, ''three jokes
    per page minimum,'' ''setup, misdirect, tag'' formula, marker-drawing during pitch—concrete
    technical detail.

    - Constraint 4 (new writer sees through Marcus): ✓ SATISFIED. Lauren ''held it
    a half-second too long, reading him,'' references his Humanitas nomination, refuses
    to laugh at deflection, smiles ''not at the joke. At him.''

    - Constraint 5 (almost-break + joke cover): ⚠ PARTIALLY SATISFIED. The marker
    snap and ''The marker hovered'' moment is strong setup, but the recovery (''I
    pitch talking dog shows...stress ball shaped like my Emmy-less mantle'') feels
    like a full joke rather than a thin cover. The constraint asks for Marcus to *almost*
    break but cover with a joke—this reads more as Marcus successfully executing a
    joke. The emotional vulnerability is present but the ''cover'' mechanism is too
    polished.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Strong. Inciting Incident (Lauren arrives at 11:03) is clearly
    marked. Rising Action (Lauren''s penetrating questions escalate Marcus''s discomfort)
    builds effectively. Midpoint (marker snap, silence) provides physical turning
    point. Climax (Lauren''s ''we''re going to write something real'') offers thematic
    confrontation. Resolution (Marcus''s steadier hand) suggests transformation. The
    Save the Cat structure is present, though this is a scene rather than full story,
    so beat execution is necessarily compressed but functional.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong character work, particularly Lauren''s introduction
    and Marcus''s internal landscape. Dialogue balances humor and subtext effectively.
    The final image (''hand was steadier than it had been in three years'') provides
    earned emotional resonance. Pacing is tight. Minor weakness: the transition from
    ''felt absolutely nothing'' to Pete''s therapy comment feels slightly abrupt—could
    use one more beat of Marcus''s internal reaction before the pivot.


    OVERALL ASSESSMENT: This is solid craft work that successfully navigates competing
    constraints. The revision process shows preservation of strengths over aggressive
    iteration, which is appropriate given strong critique scores. The final output
    satisfies 4/5 constraints clearly and 1/5 partially. The emotional complexity
    is genuine without becoming maudlin. The writers'' room feels authentic. This
    would function well as a cold open or teaser for a larger narrative about Marcus
    and Lauren''s creative partnership.'
