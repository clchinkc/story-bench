  evidence: 'The revisions successfully addressed the ''youth_voice'' critiques. The
    philosophical internal monologues were removed or rephrased to be more age-appropriate,
    and Zara''s technical dialogue was softened with more emotional cues (''her voice
    cracking slightly''). The core strengths of the initial versions, such as the
    vivid descriptions and the invention, were preserved. The final output demonstrates
    a clear improvement in Zara''s voice, making her sound more authentically 12 while
    retaining her competence. All constraints were met: Zara is competent but not
    unrealistically so, Mrs. Gable dismisses her, Kael is a flawed mentor (alcoholism,
    past failure, tremor), the Sun-Spear is her invention, and the crossing involves
    real danger (Category 5 surge, shredder currents, submerged pylons).'
