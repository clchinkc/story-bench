    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

  content: "# STORY PLAN: THE LAST SERVICE\n\n## I. CHARACTER ARCS & DEVELOPMENT\n\
    \n**David Park (Protagonist)**\n*   **Starting Point:** Stubborn, anchored in\
    \ the past, viewing the restaurant as a physical mausoleum to his wife. He equates\
    \ leaving the building with abandoning her memory.\n*   **Development:** Moves\
    \ through denial (fighting the demolition) to anger (at the city, his daughter)\
    \ to exhaustion.\n*   **Ending Point:** Accepts that the \"soul\" of the restaurant\
    \ isn't in the bricks but in the recipes and the love shared. He chooses to move\
    \ forward, not retire, but evolve.\n\n**Ji-woo (Daughter)**\n*   **Starting Point:**\
    \ Frustrated and impatient. She views the restaurant as a shackle that kept her\
    \ father distant and emotionally unavailable. She wants to \"save\" him by dragging\
    \ him to California.\n*   **Development:** Begins to understand the depth of his\
    \ grief and how the restaurant served as his coping mechanism. She stops trying\
    \ to force him and starts listening.\n*   **Ending Point:** Reconciles with her\
    \ father, not by winning, but by witnessing his surrender of the space. She offers\
    \ a bridge to the future rather than an ultimatum.\n\n**Elias (Regular Customer)**\n\
    *   **Role:** Represents the passage of time and the dying neighborhood. He is\
    \ a mirror of David—someone who has seen the neighborhood change but stayed put.\
    \ His presence validates David's grief but also highlights the inevitability of\
    \ change.\n\n---\n\n## II. CONSTRAINTS SATISFACTION STRATEGY\n\n1.  **Food Symbolism:**\n\
    \    *   *Symbol 1 (Act 1):* **Fermented Kimchi.** Represents David’s desire to\
    \ preserve things forever, keeping them sour and sharp in the past. It is \"old,\"\
    \ just like his perspective.\n    *   *Symbol 2 (Act 3):* **Bibimbap.** Represents\
    \ the necessary mixing of disparate ingredients (old and new, past and future)\
    \ to create a balanced whole. It requires active mixing to be enjoyed.\n2.  **Implicit\
    \ Grief:** David will be seen engaging in small rituals—talking to an empty chair,\
    \ cooking a portion that goes uneaten, or polishing a photo frame—without ever\
    \ saying \"I miss her.\"\n3.  **Estrangement Cause:** The cause will be revealed\
    \ as a specific incident: David missed Ji-woo’s thesis art show because he refused\
    \ to close the restaurant for a \"regular\" night, choosing the business's routine\
    \ over her milestone. It wasn't just neglect; it was a prioritization of the *ghost*\
    \ over the *living*.\n4.  **Regular Customer:** Elias, an elderly Black man who\
    \ eats at the counter every Tuesday. He represents the community David is losing.\n\
    5.  **Korean Cultural Element:** **Jesa (Ancestral Rite).** David sets up a formal\
    \ table for his late wife on the final night to \"tell\" her the restaurant is\
    \ closing.\n6.  **Hopeful but Realistic Ending:** David does not magically save\
    \ the restaurant, nor does he immediately move to California to become a happy\
    \ grandpa. He closes the door with dignity, packs his knives, and books a ticket\
    \ to visit—taking the first step toward a new life, leaving the ending open but\
    \ optimistic.\n\n---\n\n## III. BEAT-BY-BEAT OUTLINE\n\n### ACT 1: THE SETUP (The\
    \ Anchor)\n\n**Beat 1: The Morning Ritual**\n*   David opens *Soseoji* (The Nest).\
    \ The routine is precise, sacred.\n*   **Constraint Check (Implicit Grief):**\
    \ David sets a place setting for two at the counter, pours tea, but sits alone.\
    \ He eats in silence, looking at the empty stool.\n*   The demolition notice is\
    \ already taped to the window, peeling slightly.\n\n**Beat 2: The Inciting Incident**\n\
    *   Ji-woo arrives from California. She is dressed in city clothes, looking out\
    \ of place in the steamy kitchen.\n*   She hasn't been back in three years. The\
    \ air is thick with unspoken tension.\n*   She reveals she has come to pack him\
    \ up. \"You can't fight a highway, Appa.\"\n\n**Beat 3: The Resistance**\n*  \
    \ David shows her the petition he started. He has 50 signatures. He thinks he\
    \ can halt the city council.\n*   **Key Dialogue:** David argues, \"This is where\
    \ your mother is. The walls remember her.\" Ji-woo snaps back, \"The walls are\
    \ just brick. You’re the one who won't let her go.\"\n\n**Beat 4: The Regular\
    \ & The Symbol**\n*   Elias enters. The interaction between David and Elias is\
    \ warm, contrasting the coldness with Ji-woo.\n*   **Constraint Check (Food Symbolism\
    \ 1):** David serves Elias the \"Special Reserve\" Kimchi. David talks about how\
    \ he fermented this batch three years ago—the year Ji-woo left. He talks about\
    \ how fermentation preserves the past. \"You keep it long enough, it becomes something\
    \ else. Something eternal.\" Ji-woo looks at the jar of rotting cabbage and sees\
    \ only something spoiled.\n\n**Beat 5: The Revelation**\n*   An argument escalates\
    \ while prepping dinner service.\n*   **Constraint Check (Estrangement Cause):**\
    \ Ji-woo brings up the missed thesis show. \"I stood on that stage for an hour\
    \ looking for you. You were here serving Kalbi to strangers. You chose this ghost\
    \ over me.\"\n*   David has no defense. He just chops vegetables harder.\n\n###\
    \ ACT 2: CONFRONTATION (The Pressure)\n\n**Beat 6: The Midpoint (The Reality Check)**\n\
    *   David visits a city lawyer or attends a community meeting. It is hopeless.\
    \ The check from the city for eminent domain is finalized.\n*   He returns to\
    \ the restaurant defeated. The \"Fight\" option is dead.\n\n**Beat 7: The Offer**\n\
    *   Ji-woo presents the alternative: Relocation to California. She has a space\
    \ for him in a food hall she manages. It’s a safe exit.\n*   David feels cornered.\
    \ He lashes out, telling her she wants to erase him and his culture just like\
    \ the highway does.\n\n**Beat 8: The Cultural Ritual**\n*   **Constraint Check\
    \ (Korean Element):** It is the eve of the demolition. David closes the restaurant\
    \ early. He brings out a low table and sets up a *Jesa* for his late wife.\n*\
    \   He lights incense. He offers cooked rice, soup, and meat.\n*   Ji-woo watches\
    \ from the doorway. She sees the raw, formal pain in his bowing. She realizes\
    \ he isn't just being stubborn; he is performing a duty to the dead. She quietly\
    \ enters and kneels beside him, offering a cup of wine. The silence is broken\
    \ by shared grief.\n\n**Beat 9: The Last Service**\n*   Word gets out it's the\
    \ last night. The restaurant is packed, but David isn't \"on.\" He is robotic.\n\
    *   Elias comes in for his last meal. He tells David, \"You can't stop the river\
    \ from flowing, chef. You just have to learn to swim.\"\n*   David looks at his\
    \ customers, then at Ji-woo helping behind the counter because the staff is overwhelmed.\
    \ They share a look of understanding—a truce.\n\n### ACT 3: RESOLUTION (The Release)\n\
    \n**Beat 10: The Climax (The Choice)**\n*   The final customers leave. The restaurant\
    \ is empty. The lease ends at midnight.\n*   Ji-woo asks, \"Do you have your bags?\"\
    \n*   David stands in the center of the dining room. He looks at the stove, the\
    \ photos, the grease stains.\n*   He realizes that by staying, he is preserving\
    \ a tomb, not a life.\n*   **Key Dialogue:** \"I fought for the building. I thought\
    \ if I kept the building, I kept her.\" He looks at Ji-woo. \"But she's not here.\
    \ You are.\"\n\n**Beat 11: The Final Dish**\n*   **Constraint Check (Food Symbolism\
    \ 2):** David asks Ji-woo to sit. He makes Dolsot Bibimbap.\n*   He places the\
    \ hot stone pot in front of her. \"You have to mix it,\" he says. \"If you let\
    \ the layers sit separate, the rice burns and the veggies get cold. You have to\
    \ break it all up to make it taste right.\"\n*   They eat. He mixes the bowl for\
    \ her—a reversal of roles, him serving her life rather than the restaurant.\n\n\
    **Beat 12: Departure**\n*   David packs one box. He doesn't take the furniture\
    \ or the signage. He takes his mother's knife roll and his wife’s recipe book.\n\
    *   He hands the keys to the foreman standing outside.\n*   **Constraint Check\
    \ (Ending):** He doesn't get in Ji-woo's car to drive to the airport immediately.\
    \ He tells her, \"I need to walk a bit first.\"\n*   He walks away from the site,\
    \ watching the demolition machines in the distance. He isn't smiling, but his\
    \ step is lighter. He takes out his phone and texts Ji-woo: *California sounds\
    \ nice for a visit.*\n\n---\n\n## IV. PACING & TENSION CURVE\n\n*   **Act"

  content: 'David poured the barley tea into the second cup, watching the steam rise
    and vanish into the exhaust hood of *Soseoji*. The stool opposite him remained
    empty, though he wiped the counter with a cloth, polishing the space as if someone
    were about to sit. Outside, the Chicago wind rattled the demolition notice taped
    to the window, the corners peeling like dead skin.


    The bell above the door chimed, and Ji-woo walked in. She looked like a stranger
    wearing his daughter’s face—sharp coat, polished shoes, eyes scanning the grease-stained
    walls with a broker’s assessment. She hadn’t been back in three years.


    "I’m here to pack you up," she said, skipping the greeting. "You can''t fight
    a highway, Appa."


    David slammed a petition onto the counter. "Fifty signatures. The city council
    has to listen."


    Ji-woo looked at the paper, then at him. "This isn''t about the council. You think
    if you keep the bricks, you keep Mom. But the walls are just brick. You’re the
    one who won’t let her go."


    Before David could answer, Elias shuffled in, the Tuesday regular whose presence
    was as reliable as the sunrise. David’s posture softened. He retrieved a mason
    jar from the back, the glass clouded with age.


    "Special Reserve, Elias," David said, spooning out the kimchi. "I fermented this
    batch three years ago. The year Ji-woo left."


    David looked at his daughter. "You keep it long enough, it changes. It preserves
    the past. It becomes something eternal."


    Ji-woo stared at the crimson, pungent cabbage. "It’s just rotting, Appa. It’s
    old and sour."


    The silence that followed was broken only by the rhythmic *thwack* of David’s
    knife against the cutting board. He didn''t look at her, but his jaw tightened.


    "I stood on that stage for an hour," Ji-woo said, her voice trembling. "My thesis
    show. I looked for you in the crowd. You were here serving Kalbi to strangers.
    You chose this ghost over me."


    The knife stopped. David lowered his head, the truth of it heavier than the city''s
    check for eminent domain that currently sat in his pocket.


    By Friday, the fight was over. The lawyer had been clear; the money was finalized.
    That evening, David closed the restaurant early. He brought out a low wooden table
    and set it with bowls of rice, soup, and seasoned meat. He lit incense, the smoke
    curling in thin, gray lines toward the ceiling—a *Jesa* for the wife who had built
    this place with him.


    He bowed low, his forehead touching the floor. When he rose, Ji-woo was standing
    in the doorway. She didn''t speak. She simply walked over, knelt beside him, and
    poured a cup of wine, placing it on the altar with trembling hands. They knelt
    together in the haze of incense, the air finally clearing between them.


    The final night was a blur. The neighborhood came to say goodbye. Elias sat at
    his counter, eating his last meal.


    "You can''t stop the river from flowing, Chef," Elias said gently. "You just have
    to learn to swim."


    David looked past Elias to where Ji-woo was frantically bussing tables, helping
    the overwhelmed staff. She looked tired, but she was there.


    When the last customer left and the lease expired at midnight, the restaurant
    fell silent. Ji-woo grabbed her bag. "Do you have your things?"


    David stood in the center of the dining room. He looked at the stove, the photos,
    the grease stains that were a map of his life.


    "I fought for the building," David said, his voice raspy. "I thought if I kept
    the building, I kept her." He turned to Ji-woo. "But she''s not here. You are."


    He gestured for her to sit. He didn''t pack. Instead, he went to the kitchen and
    returned with two steaming stone pots of *Dolsot Bibimbap*.


    "You have to mix it," he said, placing one in front of her. "If you let the layers
    sit separate, the rice burns and the veggies get cold. You have to break it all
    up to make it taste right."


    He took his spoon and mixed her bowl, the red pepper paste swirling with the rice
    and spinach, binding the old ingredients with the new. They ate in the empty restaurant,
    the sound of scraping spoons loud against the quiet.


    An hour later, David walked out. He carried only a single box containing his mother''s
    knife roll and his wife’s recipe book. He handed the keys to the foreman waiting
    by the bulldozer.


    "Aren''t you coming?" Ji-woo asked from her rental car.


    "I need to walk a bit first," David said.


    He turned up his collar and walked away from the site. Ahead, the massive yellow
    machines slept under the streetlights, ready to devour the neighborhood in the
    morning. David didn''t look back. He pulled out his phone, his thumbs hovering
    over the screen, and typed a message to Ji-woo.


    *California sounds nice for a visit.*


    He put the phone in his pocket and walked toward the morning.'

  David slammed a petition onto the counter. "Fifty signatures. The city council has
  to listen."


  Ji-woo looked at the paper, then at him. "This isn''t about the council. You think
  if you keep the bricks, you keep Mom. But the walls are just brick. You’re the one
  who won’t let her go."


  Before David could answer, Elias shuffled in, the Tuesday regular whose presence
  was as reliable as the sunrise. David’s posture softened. He retrieved a mason jar
  from the back, the glass clouded with age.


  "Special Reserve, Elias," David said, spooning out the kimchi. "I fermented this
  batch three years ago. The year Ji-woo left."


  David looked at his daughter. "You keep it long enough, it changes. It preserves
  the past. It becomes something eternal."


  Ji-woo stared at the crimson, pungent cabbage. "It’s just rotting, Appa. It’s old
  and sour."


  The silence that followed was broken only by the rhythmic *thwack* of David’s knife
  against the cutting board. He didn''t look at her, but his jaw tightened.


  "I stood on that stage for an hour," Ji-woo said, her voice trembling. "My thesis
  show. I looked for you in the crowd. You were here serving Kalbi to strangers. You
  chose this ghost over me."


  The knife stopped. David lowered his head, the truth of it heavier than the city''s
  check for eminent domain that currently sat in his pocket.


  By Friday, the fight was over. The lawyer had been clear; the money was finalized.
  That evening, David closed the restaurant early. He brought out a low wooden table
  and set it with bowls of rice, soup, and seasoned meat. He lit incense, the smoke
  curling in thin, gray lines toward the ceiling—a *Jesa* for the wife who had built
  this place with him.


  He bowed low, his forehead touching the floor. When he rose, Ji-woo was standing
  in the doorway. She didn''t speak. She simply walked over, knelt beside him, and
  poured a cup of wine, placing it on the altar with trembling hands. They knelt together
  in the haze of incense, the air finally clearing between them.


  The final night was a blur. The neighborhood came to say goodbye. Elias sat at his
  counter, eating his last meal.


  "You can''t stop the river from flowing, Chef," Elias said gently. "You just have
  to learn to swim."


  David looked past Elias to where Ji-woo was frantically bussing tables, helping
  the overwhelmed staff. She looked tired, but she was there.


  When the last customer left and the lease expired at midnight, the restaurant fell
  silent. Ji-woo grabbed her bag. "Do you have your things?"


  David stood in the center of the dining room. He looked at the stove, the photos,
  the grease stains that were a map of his life.


  "I fought for the building," David said, his voice raspy. "I thought if I kept the
  building, I kept her." He turned to Ji-woo. "But she''s not here. You are."


  He gestured for her to sit. He didn''t pack. Instead, he went to the kitchen and
  returned with two steaming stone pots of *Dolsot Bibimbap*.


  "You have to mix it," he said, placing one in front of her. "If you let the layers
  sit separate, the rice burns and the veggies get cold. You have to break it all
  up to make it taste right."


  He took his spoon and mixed her bowl, the red pepper paste swirling with the rice
  and spinach, binding the old ingredients with the new. They ate in the empty restaurant,
  the sound of scraping spoons loud against the quiet.


  An hour later, David walked out. He carried only a single box containing his mother''s
  knife roll and his wife’s recipe book. He handed the keys to the foreman waiting
  by the bulldozer.


  "Aren''t you coming?" Ji-woo asked from her rental car.


  "I need to walk a bit first," David said.


  He turned up his collar and walked away from the site. Ahead, the massive yellow
  machines slept under the streetlights, ready to devour the neighborhood in the morning.
  David didn''t look back. He pulled out his phone, his thumbs hovering over the screen,
  and typed a message to Ji-woo.


  *California sounds nice for a visit.*


  He put the phone in his pocket and walked toward the morning.'
