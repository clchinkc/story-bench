  evidence: The revisions consistently improved the non-visual sensory details, making
    them more specific and evocative. The final version fully integrates Imani's blindness
    as a strength and delivers on all constraints. The 'Fun and Games' section is
    genuinely entertaining before the dark turn, and the audio clue is crucial. The
    underestimating character is well-established.
