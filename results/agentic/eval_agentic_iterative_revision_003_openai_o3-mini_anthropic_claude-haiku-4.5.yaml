  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-1 show incremental refinement in opening
    language and thematic setup. Version 2 introduces concrete cultural details (huevos
    rancheros, Doña Elena by name) and sensory grounding. Version 3/Final adds emotional
    vocabulary (''chained by duty,'' ''stirred by longing'') and the critical grandmother
    scene. Quality improved steadily but plateaued after establishing core beats.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION BREAKDOWN:


    1. INTERNAL CONFLICT SHOWN NOT TOLD (0.8/1.0): Strong execution. The notebook
    scene, the trembling letter, the measured conversation with Luis, and the dinner
    table moment all externalize Mateo''s struggle through action and dialogue rather
    than exposition. Minor weakness: some internal states still use telling language
    (''heart that felt both chained by duty'').


    2. GRANDMOTHER CRYSTALLIZING MOMENT (0.9/1.0): Excellent. The El Mercado photo
    booth scene is specific, sensory-rich, and emotionally resonant. Doña Elena''s
    metaphor about ''captured moments'' directly addresses Mateo''s dilemma. The hand
    on his arm provides physical grounding. This is the strongest constraint execution.


    3. ADULT UNDERSTANDING (0.7/1.0): Partially satisfied. Luis demonstrates genuine
    understanding (''You''re not just living for their dreams''), but his role is
    brief and somewhat generic. Doña Elena understands but doesn''t explicitly articulate
    comprehension of his specific conflict—her wisdom is more universal than targeted
    to his particular struggle. Needed: deeper dialogue showing Luis or another adult
    naming the specific tension.


    4. AUTHENTIC CULTURAL ELEMENTS (0.6/1.0): Mixed execution. Huevos rancheros, cilantro,
    hand-painted pottery, adobe house, and frijoles are present but somewhat surface-level.
    The photo booth moment feels slightly constructed. Stronger elements: the border
    town setting, family dinner dynamics, the concept of prescribed futures. Weaker:
    cultural specificity could deepen (no Spanish dialogue, limited exploration of
    immigration/border context despite setting).


    5. EARNED RESOLUTION (0.65/1.0): Adequate but incomplete. Mateo''s decision to
    attend the program shows growth, but the resolution feels somewhat rushed. The
    family''s ''conflicted emotions'' and Doña Elena''s ''unspoken pride'' are told
    rather than shown through specific reactions. The final image (''blend of honoring
    his past and daring to claim his own destiny'') is thematic summary rather than
    earned emotional truth. Needed: concrete consequences, specific family dialogue,
    or a scene showing how he''ll actually balance both paths.


    PROCESS STRENGTHS: Revisions consistently improved opening imagery and added the
    essential grandmother scene. Cultural details accumulated naturally. The notebook
    detail persisted effectively.


    PROCESS WEAKNESSES: Luis''s character remained underdeveloped across all versions.
    The resolution beat was never substantially revised—it remained thematic summary.
    No version fully integrated Spanish language or deeper cultural specificity despite
    the setting.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY ASSESSMENT: The prose is lyrical and competent (0.75/1.0). Metaphors
    are consistent (heat, stages, captured moments). Pacing is measured. However,
    the story relies heavily on poetic language to convey emotion rather than dramatic
    action. The final section (climax through resolution) compresses significant emotional
    beats into summary rather than scene. The work reads as a strong short story opening
    or character study but lacks the dramatic specificity needed for full narrative
    satisfaction.'
