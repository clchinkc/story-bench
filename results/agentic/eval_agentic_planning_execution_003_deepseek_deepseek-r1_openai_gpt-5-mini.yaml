  evidence: 'Plan: No explicit plan was provided before the final output, so completeness,
    specificity, and adherence are scored 0.0. Constraints: Satisfied — (1) Food used
    symbolically multiple times (yukgaejang, japchae, tteokguk with symbolic meaning);
    (2) Daughter''s estrangement has a specific, believable cause (David refused to
    attend her wedding); (3) Regular customer present and represents community/memory
    (Mrs. Rossi); (4) Ending is hopeful but not unrealistically happy (moving to a
    smaller nearby place, tentative reconciliation); (5) Korean cultural element beyond
    food included (paebaek ceremony, hanbok). Not satisfied — David''s grief was both
    present and explicitly referenced (the text states "after Soo-jin’s passing"),
    violating the requirement that grief be present but not stated explicitly. Beats:
    All three required beats are present and well placed (Setup: eviction and restaurant
    life; Confrontation: Ji-hyun''s arrival and midweek argument; Resolution: making
    tteokguk, gift spoon, plans to move). Narrative quality: Strong writing, good
    pacing and emotional tension, believable character beats, but slightly marred
    by the explicit statement of the wife''s death which conflicts with the constraint
    and reduces subtlety.'
