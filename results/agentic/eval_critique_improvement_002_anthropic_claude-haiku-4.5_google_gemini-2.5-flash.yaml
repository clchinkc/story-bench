  evidence: The initial versions were identical, suggesting a lack of iterative improvement
    in the early stages. However, the final output demonstrates significant improvement,
    addressing the emotional complexity and character depth critiques effectively.
    The humor is present early, followed by the pathos, and the new writer's insight
    is well-developed. The moment Marcus almost breaks is subtly handled. The theme
    is stated by Iris, a minor character. The craft of comedy writing is shown through
    Marcus's 'knife' analogy. All constraints are met. The Save the Cat beats are
    present, though perhaps not explicitly called out, the narrative arc of Marcus's
    internal struggle and Iris's catalyst is clear.
