output: "**Title: The Forge of Kings**  \n\nKael’s hammer rang against steel, the\
  \ rhythm as familiar as the scar on his palm. Aldric watched from the shadows, his\
  \ one good eye narrowing as the boy shaped a blade with unnatural precision. “Your\
  \ father would’ve been proud,” the old blacksmith muttered, though Kael didn’t hear.\
  \ The apprentice’s mind was elsewhere—drawn to the crimson haze lingering over the\
  \ distant mountains, where the Blight King’s curse devoured the realm.  \n\nThat\
  \ night, a royal messenger arrived, bloodied and frantic. “The king commands your\
  \ presence,” he gasped, thrusting a scroll into Kael’s hands. The seal bore a crest\
  \ Kael didn’t recognize—a serpent coiled around a forge. Aldric’s knuckles whitened\
  \ as Kael read aloud: *“You are the last heir of House Virelan. Come to claim your\
  \ birthright.”*  \n\nThe old man’s sigh was a lifetime of secrets. “Your father\
  \ died defending the throne,” Aldric said, pulling a dented locket from his tunic.\
  \ Inside was a portrait of a man in silver armor, his face a mirror of Kael’s. “I\
  \ swore to keep you hidden. But the curse is spreading. You must go.”  \n\nKael’s\
  \ throat tightened. *Royal blood?* He’d been a pawn in a story he’d never asked\
  \ for. Yet when he glimpsed the villagers’ hollow eyes—hungry, scared—his hammer\
  \ felt heavier. He nodded.  \n\nCrossing the village’s threshold, Kael entered a\
  \ world unraveling. Trees wept ash. Wolves with eyes like smoldering coals stalked\
  \ the roads. Aldric’s parting gift—a sword hilt forged from meteoric iron—hung at\
  \ his belt, its weight a poor substitute for the man’s guidance.  \n\nAt the castle\
  \ gates, the Blight King’s soldiers seized him.  \n\n“You’ll forge weapons for the\
  \ Dark Bastion,” the captain sneered, dragging Kael into the dungeon-forges. Iron\
  \ grates groaned overhead, where prisoners were chained to fuel the infernal crucibles.\
  \ Kael’s hands trembled as he was handed a ingot of shadowsteel, a cursed metal\
  \ that devoured light.  \n\n*This is the Ordeal.* The Blight King’s smiths watched,\
  \ grinning, as Kael’s fingers blistered. They knew the metal was unworkable—no blade\
  \ could temper its darkness. But Aldric had taught him a secret: *“True strength\
  \ isn’t in the steel. It’s in the fire.”*  \n\nHours bled into midnight. Kael fed\
  \ the forge with his locket, his father’s armor, his own resolve. The ingot glowed\
  \ white, then blue, then *alive*. The smiths’ laughter died as he shaped the metal\
  \ into a blade that hummed with dawnlight.  \n\nThe captain stormed in, snarling.\
  \ “A trick!” He lunged, and Kael, the last heir of Virelan, swung his hammer. The\
  \ man crumpled, his armor splitting like eggshell. Chaos erupted.  \n\nKael ran,\
  \ the sword blazing in his grip. Through catacombs thick with decay, he climbed\
  \ to the throne room, where the Blight King—once his uncle, now a rotting crown\
  \ of shadows—waited. “You think a *smith* can kill a god?” the monster hissed. \
  \ \n\nKael didn’t answer. He drove the blade into the throne, and the fire from\
  \ his forge surged through the walls, the land, the *bones* of the kingdom. The\
  \ Blight King screamed as light tore his curse asunder.  \n\nWhen the smoke cleared,\
  \ Kael stood at the threshold of a reborn kingdom, the sword shattered in his grip.\
  \ Aldric’s voice echoed in his memory: *“You were never just a blacksmith’s apprentice.”*\
  \  \n\nNo. He was the first king to forge his own crown—and the last king the darkness\
  \ would ever know."
