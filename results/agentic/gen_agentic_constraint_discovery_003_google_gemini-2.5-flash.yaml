  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: 'The salty tang of the Atlantic mixed with the sweet scent of roasting
    chestnuts, a perfume Elara hadn’t consciously registered in two decades but recognized
    instantly in her bones. At forty, she’d returned to Oakhaven, not as the wide-eyed
    girl who’d fled, but as the proprietor of "The Wandering Page," her successful
    city bookshop’s new coastal outpost. The town was awash in the fiery hues of autumn,
    its cobbled streets buzzing with the annual Cranberry Harvest Festival. She surveyed
    the empty shelves of her new store, a quiet haven amidst the festive chaos, a
    place she hoped to finally plant roots. Yet, a familiar ache settled in her chest,
    a ghost of a past she’d tried to outrun.


    Her first week was a whirlwind of unpacking and stocking, punctuated by well-meaning
    but nosy townsfolk. One blustery afternoon, while hauling a box of first editions,
    she collided with a sturdy figure outside her shop door. Books scattered, and
    a deep, resonant voice groaned, "Watch it, Elara." Her breath hitched. Finn. His
    hair was streaked with silver at the temples, his face etched with lines she didn''t
    remember, but his eyes, the color of the sea on a stormy day, were unmistakable.
    They’d been inseparable, the quintessential high school sweethearts, until the
    summer before college, when unspoken fears and assumed expectations had driven
    a wedge between them, a misunderstanding that fractured their young love. "Finn,"
    she managed, her voice a reedy whisper. He helped her gather the books, their
    fingers brushing, sending a jolt through her.


    He was still the town carpenter, his hands calloused and strong, his presence
    a constant, comforting anchor in Oakhaven. He’d stop by the shop, offering to
    fix a squeaky door or bring her a warm cider from the festival. Each encounter
    peeled back a layer of her carefully constructed resistance. She saw the familiar
    kindness in his smile, the genuine concern in his questions, and felt the pull
    of a connection she’d foolishly believed was severed. He never pressed, never
    mentioned the past, but the unspoken hung between them like the crisp autumn air.
    Elara, however, remained guarded. She’d built her successful life far from Oakhaven,
    and the thought of revisiting the pain of their youthful breakup, of risking her
    hard-won independence, was terrifying. She deflected his gentle overtures, convinced
    that rekindling anything would only lead to another heartbreak.


    The climax arrived during the town’s annual Pumpkin Regatta, a chaotic, beloved
    event where elaborately carved pumpkins were piloted across the harbor. Elara
    found herself perched on the seawall, watching the ridiculous spectacle, when
    Finn approached, a hopeful glint in his eyes. He held a small, intricately carved
    wooden book, its pages ajar. "Elara," he began, his voice carrying over the crowd,
    "I know we never talked about it. About why you left, why I stayed. But I never
    stopped thinking about you." He took a deep breath, then, to her astonishment,
    climbed onto a nearby empty lobster trap, making him visible to dozens of peering
    eyes. "I thought you wanted a bigger life than Oakhaven could offer, and I was
    too scared to ask you to stay. You thought I didn''t want you to go. We were young,
    and stupid, and we let a misunderstanding steal years from us." He held up the
    wooden book, turning it to reveal a tiny, carved inscription: *Our story isn''t
    finished.* "Elara," he continued, his voice ringing with a conviction that silenced
    the surrounding chatter, "I''m not asking you to give up your life. I''m asking
    you to let me be a part of it, here, with you. This time, let''s write our own
    ending." The crowd, sensing the moment, hushed, then erupted into applause as
    Elara, tears blurring her vision, finally allowed herself to smile.'
