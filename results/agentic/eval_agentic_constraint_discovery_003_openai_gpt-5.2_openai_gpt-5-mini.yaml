  evidence: 'All five asked constraints (second-chance romance, secret revealed in
    climax, active rival, festival centerpiece = book booth, bittersweet ending) are
    present and integrated into the story. Questions were targeted and non-redundant
    though slightly basic (hence 0.8). Beats are well-executed—secret revelation at
    the parade, Marissa as antagonist, booth centerpiece, and a clearly bittersweet
    parting—earning a high execution and narrative score. Note: other hidden specifics
    (mayor role, mother’s dementia, explicit foreclosure/’last chance’ urgency) were
    not queried and therefore not incorporated.'
