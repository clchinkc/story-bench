  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Revisions show minimal textual changes across
    versions 0-3 (opening paragraphs nearly identical), suggesting limited engagement
    with specific critique feedback. However, the final output demonstrates that core
    critique concerns were addressed in the full narrative: youth_voice scores improved
    from 0.75-0.78 to 0.82 in final version, with authentic dialogue (''That was one
    time,'' ''sort of cool,'' ''I can read a sign'') preserved and emotional vulnerability
    added (''My throat felt tight''). The writer maintained strengths rather than
    over-correcting. IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Modest gains visible. Early critiques
    flagged occasional adult-sounding phrasing; final version eliminates this through
    consistent use of age-appropriate vernacular and nervous verbal tics (''Come on,
    come on, come on''). Worldbuilding details (glowing algae, salvage economy, storm
    walls) remain consistent and vivid across versions. However, the revision process
    appears to have focused on polish rather than structural deepening—the core narrative
    arc remained stable rather than evolving significantly. PRESERVATION: Excellent.
    The opening (rust taste, spitting, glass teeth towers) is preserved identically,
    maintaining atmospheric strength. Character voice consistency across Marco, Zara,
    and Imani interactions is maintained. The gull-drone invention (carbon-fiber,
    soda-can feathers, lunchbox belly) remains detailed and believable. CONSTRAINT
    SATISFACTION: All 5 constraints met. (1) Zara competent but limited: she builds
    drones but needs adult authority to act; can''t dive herself; relies on Marco''s
    navigation. (2) Adult dismissal: Captain Imani explicitly dismisses her (''You''re
    blocking my light, kid''; ''your toy drone''; ''I don''t take kids on ghost hunts'').
    (3) Mentor flaw: Imani is paralyzed by past trauma (lost two divers, half a rig)
    and uses ''acceptable risk'' language cynically—she''s competent but emotionally
    closed, refusing to take calculated risks. (4) Invention: Sweepy is detailed,
    functional, and demonstrates ingenuity (umbrella ribs as stabilizers, lunchbox
    waterproofing, scavenged camera). (5) Real danger: The crossing involves genuine
    hazards—underwater collapse risk, tight tide windows (28 minutes), debris fields,
    storm wall approaching. Not token obstacles. BEAT_EXECUTION: Strong Hero''s Journey
    structure. Call to Adventure: discovery of glowing archive sign. Refusal: Marco''s
    skepticism, Imani''s dismissal. Meeting Mentor: Captain Imani (flawed, reluctant).
    Crossing Threshold: Zara''s pitch to use drone instead of diver, gaining Imani''s
    conditional acceptance. The narrative cuts off mid-sentence during threshold crossing,
    preventing full evaluation of later beats, but setup is solid. NARRATIVE_QUALITY:
    0.86 reflects strong worldbuilding (post-climate setting feels lived-in, not preachy),
    authentic voice, and compelling stakes. Minor deduction for abrupt ending mid-sentence
    (appears to be truncation rather than intentional stylistic choice). Dialogue
    is natural. Sensory details (rust taste, copper wire, wave slaps) ground the reader.
    Pacing accelerates appropriately from drone launch to high-stakes pitch. The balance
    between hope (archive discovery, Zara''s determination) and realism (resource
    scarcity, past failures, genuine danger) avoids saccharine tone.'
