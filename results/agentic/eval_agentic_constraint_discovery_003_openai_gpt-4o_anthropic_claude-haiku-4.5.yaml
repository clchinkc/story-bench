  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Questions successfully identified 3/5 constraints
    (past relationship, financial struggle, family obligation). However, two critical
    constraints were missed: (1) the protagonist''s mother''s dementia as the actual
    reason for return, and (2) the 20-year timeline with broken engagement specificity.
    The questions were well-formed and covered diverse areas (relationship, finances,
    family, decision-making), but lacked depth probing into the specific nature of
    family obligations and the precise timeline. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: The output
    incorporates the discovered constraints but with significant gaps. The bookshop
    struggle is present but underdeveloped. The past relationship with Ethan exists
    but lacks the weight of a broken engagement. CRITICAL FAILURES: (1) Aunt Margaret''s
    death replaces mother''s dementia entirely—a fundamental misalignment with hidden
    constraints. (2) No mention of 20-year separation or broken engagement specifics.
    (3) Ethan is not positioned as the town mayor, eliminating a key power dynamic.
    (4) The autumn festival is present but the 2-week foreclosure deadline urgency
    is absent. BEAT EXECUTION: Story hits emotional beats (reunion, rekindled connection,
    decision point) but misses structural urgency beats (foreclosure timeline, dementia
    progression, mayoral conflict). NARRATIVE QUALITY: Well-written prose with good
    pacing and emotional resonance, but the foundation rests on partially incorrect
    constraints, undermining thematic coherence. The story works as a romance but
    fails as the specific story the constraints demanded.'
