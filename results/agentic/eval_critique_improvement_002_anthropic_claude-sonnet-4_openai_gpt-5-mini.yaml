  evidence: Across the three revision rounds the changes were incremental rather than
    structural. Early critiques flagged a need for clearer emotional turns and more
    vivid craft detail; the final draft responds by inserting sharper beats of pathos
    (the "crack" behind Marcus's sternum, the trembling hand) and by foregrounding
    craft-talk (setup/escalation/callback, 'setup-punchline-tag', runner, B-story).
    The theme is explicitly voiced by Zoe in later drafts and Marcus's near-break
    is made explicit and then masked with a joke. Strengths—room banter, craft terminology,
    and Marcus's comic first impression—are preserved; improvements center on deepening
    Marcus's interior life and giving Zoe clearer agency. Changes improved emotional
    clarity but did not fully develop a complete Save-the-Cat arc, so progress is
    moderate rather than transformative.
