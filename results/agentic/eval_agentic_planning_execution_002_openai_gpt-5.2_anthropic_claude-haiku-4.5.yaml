  evidence: 'PLAN QUALITY: Exceptionally detailed plan with clear character arcs,
    behavioral specifics (bone-conduction earbuds, text-only communication, hyper-ordered
    spaces), and thematic coherence. KITE as unconventional mentor is genuinely creative—an
    AI that detects rather than interprets, offering corrections without anthropomorphism.
    Plan explicitly seeds all constraints and beats with concrete examples.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5.5/6): (1) Isolation through specific behaviors—EXCELLENT:
    earbuds, text preference, eating alone, surface-wiping, eye-contact avoidance
    all demonstrated naturally. (2) Alien signal feels genuinely alien—EXCELLENT:
    the signal is relational, phase-based, refuses symbolic reduction, demonstrates
    branching futures rather than delivering a message. (3) Challenging colleague—EXCELLENT:
    Mateo directly opposes Yuki''s theoretical isolation, pushes embodied context,
    creates productive friction. (4) Unconventional mentor—EXCELLENT: KITE is not
    wise or nurturing; it detects patterns and corrects without understanding, forcing
    Yuki to adapt rather than be guided. (5) Psychological threshold—EXCELLENT: Yuki''s
    threshold is removing earbuds and accepting unfiltered human presence; the signal''s
    threshold is a parameter crossing that collapses stability. (6) Genuine human
    connection moment—ADEQUATE (0.5/1.0): The mug scene is touching and surprising,
    but it''s brief and somewhat understated. The moment works emotionally but could
    have been more visceral or disruptive to Yuki''s equilibrium.


    BEAT EXECUTION (4/4): (1) Call to Adventure—STRONG: Okoye''s summons is urgent,
    specific, and challenges Yuki''s refusal to engage. (2) Refusal of the Call—STRONG:
    Yuki attempts remote work, claims commitments, tries to avoid. (3) Meeting the
    Mentor—STRONG: KITE''s voice from the ceiling is unexpected and unsettling; the
    interaction is functional rather than warm. (4) Crossing the Threshold—STRONG:
    Removing earbuds is the psychological crossing; accepting collaboration is the
    commitment.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Pacing is deliberate and controlled, matching Yuki''s psychology.
    Sensory detail is precise (white noise, dry air, steam, metal ticking). Dialogue
    feels natural and reveals character through what''s unsaid. The signal visualization
    is conceptually clear without being over-explained. Tension builds through constraint
    rather than action. The ending—''let''s learn how to listen''—is thematically
    resonant and earned.


    ADHERENCE: Output follows plan closely. Minor deviation: plan mentions Yuki''s
    paper notebook as ''one thing that wasn''t necessary''; output includes it but
    doesn''t activate it narratively (acceptable for opening movement). KITE''s voice
    is slightly more corrective than the plan suggested, but this strengthens the
    unconventional mentor role.


    WEAKNESS: The human connection moment (mug scene) is emotionally effective but
    narratively brief. It could have been extended or made more disruptive to Yuki''s
    composure to fully satisfy the ''surprises Yuki'' requirement. As written, it''s
    touching but somewhat expected given Mateo''s established kindness.'
