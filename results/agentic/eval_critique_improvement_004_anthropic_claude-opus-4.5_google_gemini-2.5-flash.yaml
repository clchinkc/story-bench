  evidence: The critiques consistently highlighted the strength of Teddy's interiority
    and the subtle ways his avoidance was shown. The revisions, particularly from
    V2 to V3 and the final output, deepened this by adding the line 'and thought of
    nothing. That was the point.' which explicitly states his motivation for the routine,
    and by further developing the interaction with Denise to directly address his
    avoidance of Marlene's memory. The final version successfully integrates the feedback
    by making Teddy's internal struggle more explicit through his actions and thoughts,
    while maintaining the subtle, evocative prose praised in earlier critiques. The
    introduction of Denise and the garden provides a clear 'new path' that directly
    addresses the 'avoiding' aspect of his grief, which was a key constraint.
