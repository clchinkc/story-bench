  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→1 removed ''without thinking'' (showing vs telling
    internal conflict). Versions 1→2 strengthened sensory specificity (Jarritos clinked,
    double-bagging without being told) and deepened cultural authenticity. Versions
    2→3 maintained gains while final output expanded dramatically to include the full
    scene arc. The progression shows deliberate refinement rather than major overhauls.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. INTERNAL CONFLICT SHOWN NOT TOLD (0.95): Mateo''s conflict manifests through
    physical tells—thumb hovering over email, half-smile reflex, shoulders tight,
    nails digging crescents, shoved envelope, hesitation. The locked phone screen
    and mechanical eating are particularly effective. No exposition explaining his
    feelings.

    2. GRANDMOTHER CRYSTALLIZING MOMENT (0.95): The scene where Abuela removes the
    TV, asks ''Enséñame,'' reads the letter, then shares her border crossing story
    is the emotional fulcrum. Her admission ''Yo también tengo miedo'' and reframing
    of responsibility (''That''s you being scared and putting our names on it'') directly
    addresses his guilt and gives him permission. This is earned, not imposed.

    3. ADULT UNDERSTANDING (0.9): Mr. Herrera''s text (''make sure it''s *you* choosing'')
    shows genuine comprehension. Abuela goes further—she understands both his fear
    AND his hunger, validates both, and distinguishes between responsibility and self-sacrifice.
    His father''s deflation suggests growing understanding. His mother''s direct question
    (''If not for me, if not for Abuela...'') shows she''s trying to understand his
    actual desire.

    4. CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY (0.92): Spanish dialogue feels organic (code-switching,
    diminutives, ''Ajá,'' ''Mira nomás''). Details are specific: Noviembre Guadalupe
    calendar, Domingo de Ramos palm cross, comal, agua de jamaica, Univision novela,
    Vicks vapor rub, rebozo. The border crossing backstory connects immigration history
    to present stakes without performativity. Abuela''s voice carries generational
    weight.

    5. EARNED RESOLUTION (0.88): The final scene shows Mateo hasn''t decided yet—he''s
    still torn (''I don''t wanna leave you... But I... I can''t stop thinking'').
    This is honest. His growth is visible in: (a) showing Abuela the letter instead
    of hiding it, (b) articulating his fears aloud, (c) hearing his family''s actual
    positions rather than projecting them, (d) recognizing the distinction between
    guilt and genuine responsibility. The resolution is *in progress*, which is more
    earned than a neat choice would be.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.88): Opening establishes setting and Mateo''s practiced performance
    (0.9). Email discovery creates inciting incident (0.85). Family dinner shows stakes
    and his avoidance (0.9). Abuela scene is the turning point—her vulnerability,
    her reframing, her permission (0.95). Final family meeting shows collective reckoning
    (0.8—slightly less polished, dialogue feels slightly more expository). The incomplete
    ending is intentional and appropriate (0.9).


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.9): Prose is precise and sensory-rich (''heat pressed down,''
    ''Jarritos clinked like distant bells,'' ''skin papery but grip steady''). Pacing
    accelerates appropriately from work scene through internal struggle to family
    confrontation. Dialogue carries both plot and character. The emotional arc is
    clear without being manipulative. One minor note: the final paragraph cuts off
    mid-sentence, which may be intentional (showing incompleteness) or accidental—if
    accidental, this would lower to 0.85.


    WEAKNESSES: (1) The final scene''s dialogue becomes slightly more expository than
    earlier scenes. (2) The incomplete final sentence creates ambiguity about whether
    this is intentional stylistic choice or truncation. (3) Minor: could use one more
    sensory beat in the family meeting to match the richness of earlier scenes.'
