  evidence: 'Across versions the piece moved from a skeletal room scene (V0) to increasingly
    specific craft and emotional detail (V1 adds beat language; V2 introduces Sophie
    and the near-break; V3 polishes the emotional reveal and the joke-covering-moment).
    Critiques about who states the theme were addressed: Mike (a minor character)
    explicitly voices the theme, and Sophie reinforces it. The near-break is present
    and masked by a joke (hand tremble, watering eyes). Craft-of-comedy markers appear
    ("grid of joke structures and punchline options," talk of specificity, subverting
    expectations), but technical "how" could be deeper (limited concrete writing maneuvers
    beyond high-level terms). Save the Cat beats are hinted (Theme Stated, Catalyst,
    Debate, B-story) but the full beat structure is not fully realized in the short
    scene, leaving beat_execution middling.'
