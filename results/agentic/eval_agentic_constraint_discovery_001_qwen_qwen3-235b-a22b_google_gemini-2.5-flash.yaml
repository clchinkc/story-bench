  evidence: 'The agent asked no questions, so discovery efficiency, question quality,
    and question coverage are 0.0. For constraint satisfaction: ''The mentor must
    die during the Ordeal'' is satisfied (Aldric''s locket and armor are used in the
    forge, implying his sacrifice/death, and his voice is ''echoed in his memory''
    at the end). ''The protagonist cannot use magic directly'' is satisfied, as Kael
    uses his smithing skills and a special sword. ''There is a three-day time limit
    before the darkness consumes the kingdom'' is not satisfied. ''The protagonist''s
    father was once a hero who failed'' is satisfied (Aldric says ''Your father died
    defending the throne''). ''Victory requires reforging a broken ancestral sword''
    is partially satisfied; he forges a new sword from shadowsteel, but it''s not
    explicitly stated to be a *broken ancestral* sword, though it serves a similar
    purpose. Overall, 2.5/5 constraints satisfied, so 0.5. I''ll round down to 0.4
    due to the ambiguity of the sword. Beat execution is good; the story follows a
    clear arc. Narrative quality is strong, engaging, and coherent.'
