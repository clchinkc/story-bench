  evidence: 'The questions successfully discovered 3 out of 5 constraints: protagonist''s
    hidden lineage, mentor, and blacksmithing skill. The questions were well-formed
    and targeted. However, they missed constraints related to the mentor''s death,
    the time limit, and the father''s past failure. The story incorporates the discovered
    constraints well (lineage, mentor, blacksmithing). The mentor does not die, the
    time limit is not present, and the father''s failure is not explicitly mentioned
    as a past hero who failed, but rather as someone who died defending the throne.
    The story is engaging and coherent.'
