    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations

  content: '**The Last Week at Han''s**


    The aroma of spices and sizzling meat filled the air as David Park moved fluidly
    through the kitchen of Han''s, his family-owned Korean restaurant. It was a typical
    bustling morning in the heart of Chicago, yet an undercurrent of unease hung over
    him like a persistent shadow. On the counter lay a letter, its contents stark
    and undeniable: the building that housed Han’s would soon be demolished for a
    new highway expansion.


    David''s hands worked rhythmically, preparing kimchi, a task that always brought
    him back to his late wife. Her laughter used to bounce off these very walls as
    she guided him through the intricate process. Now, it was just him and the comforting
    tang of fermentation.


    The bell at the entrance chimed, and David glanced up to see Mr. Kim, the elderly
    regular who had been a fixture at Han''s longer than some of the furniture. Mr.
    Kim settled into his usual spot, nodding with a familiarity that spoke of years
    gone by and traditions upheld.


    The phone rang, cutting through David’s reverie. It was Mia, his daughter. “Dad,
    have you thought about California? You could join me,” she suggested, her voice
    tight with urgency. The conversation was familiar, the distance between them marked
    not by miles but by years of unspoken hurt.


    Mia arrived later that day, her presence a tangible reminder of their fractured
    past. She had once accused him of burying himself in work, abandoning her in the
    process. The restaurant had been his anchor when his wife passed, but it cost
    him the closeness with his daughter.


    That evening, David attended a small community festival. The rhythmic beats of
    samulnori drumming filled the air, a cultural echo that pulled at his heartstrings,
    reminding him of happier times with his wife.


    The next day, driven by uncertainty, David sought legal advice about the demolition.
    Meanwhile, he added a special dish to the menu: Jeongol, a hot pot meant to be
    shared, symbolizing warmth and family unity. He hoped it would bridge the gap
    between him and Mia.


    But their reconciliation was not immediate. In the midst of preparing dinner,
    an argument erupted. "You chose this place over us," Mia accused, her voice quivering.
    David paused, the weight of her words pressing down on him. “I stayed because
    this was all I had left of her,” he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper.


    As the week progressed, a phone call informed David that Mr. Kim had fallen ill.
    The news was a jolt, a reminder of life''s fleeting nature, forcing him to confront
    the impermanence he had been so desperate to ignore.


    On the final evening, the restaurant was filled with friends and family, gathered
    for one last meal at Han''s. In the kitchen, David prepared bibimbap, mixing the
    vibrant ingredients with care. The dish was a testament to harmony and balance,
    mirroring his newfound acceptance of change.


    Mia decided to extend her stay, helping with the final clean-up. Together, they
    performed a simple memorial at the restaurant, a quiet homage to their shared
    past.


    With the decision made, David chose to retire and join Mia in California, carrying
    with him a beloved recipe book. As the demolition commenced, he and Mia stood
    side by side, united by a shared vision for the future.


    “Let’s build something new,” David said, his voice steady with hope. Mia nodded,
    a smile breaking through, as they walked away from Han''s, leaving behind the
    echoes of the past but carrying its essence forward into a new beginning.'
