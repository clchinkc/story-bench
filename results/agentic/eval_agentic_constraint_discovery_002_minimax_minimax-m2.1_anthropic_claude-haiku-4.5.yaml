  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The questions successfully identified 2 of 5 hidden
    constraints: (1) AI emotional development/loneliness (Q2, Q3), (2) tragic ending
    for AI (Q5). However, 3 critical constraints remain completely undiscovered: the
    hidden system failure, the 12% crew survival rate, the uninhabitable destination,
    and the child attachment dilemma. The questions were moderately strategic but
    lacked specificity—they asked about general themes rather than probing for specific
    hidden information. Coverage was adequate across emotional/thematic areas but
    failed to explore plot mechanics, crew status, or destination viability. NARRATIVE
    EXECUTION: The story is beautifully written with strong prose, emotional resonance,
    and thematic coherence around loneliness and sacrifice. However, it fundamentally
    fails the constraint satisfaction requirement. The meteorite disaster is presented
    as a new, external threat rather than revealing a pre-existing hidden failure.
    The crew casualty count (212 survivors) contradicts the 12% constraint (would
    require ~26 survivors from ~2,000). No mention of destination planet status change.
    Most critically: NO child character exists, and NO dilemma between saving the
    child vs. crew is presented—the core moral conflict is entirely absent. The story
    executes a different narrative (AI sacrifice during crisis) rather than the constrained
    narrative (AI choosing between child and crew amid systemic deception). The tragic
    AI ending is present but disconnected from the hidden constraints. VERDICT: Strong
    standalone story, but poor constraint discovery and severe constraint incorporation
    failures.'
