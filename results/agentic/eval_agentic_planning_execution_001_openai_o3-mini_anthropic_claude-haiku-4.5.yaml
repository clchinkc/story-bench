  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan comprehensively addresses all required beats (Catalyst:
    anonymous tip + symbol match; Debate: FBI vs. solo pursuit + false lead with Donovan
    Price; Break into Two: Price betrayal forces method shift; Midpoint: verbal confrontation
    with informant). Five of six constraints clearly satisfied: (1) False lead with
    Price is compelling and misdirects effectively; (2) Unconventional profiling via
    digital footprint/data streams is creative; (3) Ticking clock announced murder
    time creates urgency; (4) Price''s betrayal is personal and professional; (5)
    Midpoint confrontation is verbal/psychological, not physical. Output follows plan
    closely with strong atmospheric writing and emotional resonance. Marcus explicitly
    confronts past failure (partner''s death, previous inability to catch killer).
    WEAKNESSES: Constraint #6 (secondary character betrayal) is somewhat ambiguous—Price
    is the betrayer, but his role as ''secondary character'' could be debated; he''s
    introduced late and lacks depth. The ''Break into Two'' beat is implied but not
    explicitly marked as a structural turning point in output. Digital profiling technique,
    while unconventional, lacks concrete procedural detail (how exactly does weather
    data + social media = location?). Final confrontation setup feels slightly rushed;
    the ''mysterious informant'' appears suddenly without prior introduction. Narrative
    quality is strong but occasionally relies on tell-over-show (e.g., ''guilt became
    a living thing''). Pacing is generally solid but the transition from false lead
    discovery to new methodology could be more gradual.'
