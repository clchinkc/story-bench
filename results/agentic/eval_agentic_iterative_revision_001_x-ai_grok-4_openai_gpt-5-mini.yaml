  evidence: 'Version 0 was a fragment that established Elena''s competence but ended
    abruptly. Version 1 made a small tonal tweak (adding ''comfort zone'') but was
    still incomplete. Version 2 showed no substantive change. Version 3 tightened
    sentences and added concrete actions (securing antiviral supplies, mediating a
    dispute) that hinted at character breadth. The Final output substantially expanded
    the arc: it introduces an inciting medical crisis (Maria''s fever), includes specific
    clinical details (suspected secondary bacterial pneumonia, chest X-ray showing
    patchy infiltrates, IV antibiotics), shows Elena moving from managerial competence
    to awkward bedside presence, and builds a believable friendship through repeated,
    earned interactions. The ending returns to ambiguity about whether Elena''s internal
    shift will persist. Good elements from the opening (her competence, atmosphere
    of the ER) were preserved while specificity and emotional depth increased across
    revisions.'
