  evidence: The revisions, particularly from V0 to V1 and V2, show a clear effort
    to deepen Teddy's interiority and integrate the constraints more smoothly. The
    initial versions were more descriptive of the routine, but subsequent revisions
    added emotional weight and connected the routine's disruption to Teddy's avoidance
    of Eleanor's memory. The final version successfully weaves in the neighbor and
    the new path's benefits, while maintaining the strong opening and detailed routine.
    The critiques highlighted areas for stronger interiority, and the final output
    delivers on this, showing Teddy's internal struggle and growth through his actions
    and observations. Strengths like the detailed routine and the presence of Eleanor
    through absence were preserved and enhanced.
