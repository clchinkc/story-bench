  evidence: 'Version 0 established a strong auditory premise but was spare on tactile
    and olfactory detail. Version 1 added humidity and scent (smell) improving non-visual
    atmosphere. Version 2 introduced tactile detail (mug handle) and a cat, anchoring
    Imani physically and adding domestic sound texture. Version 3 sharpened specifics
    (bells sharp on humid days; espresso machine ''death rattle'') and restored cadence.
    The final consolidates these gains: prominent non-visual senses (sound, touch,
    smell), a distinctive audio clue (three church bell chimes with the third flat
    and a rhythmic metal scraping) that becomes central, a respectful portrayal of
    Imani''s auditory expertise (blindness implied and shown as a strength through
    her mapping skills), a character (Detective Carroll) who initially underestimates
    her, and a Fun and Games section that energizes the investigation before the envelope/USB
    turns the tone dark. Overall quality increased steadily across revisions with
    good preservation of initial strengths; minor quibbles: blindness is implied rather
    than explicitly stated, but it is portrayed respectfully and functionally as a
    strength.'
