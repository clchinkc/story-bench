  evidence: 'The plan is very complete and specific, outlining each beat with concrete
    details and addressing all constraints. The final output adheres closely to the
    plan, with only minor deviations (e.g., the mentor''s introduction is slightly
    different but still effective). All constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is
    shown through specific behaviors (noise-canceling pods, texting, rehydrated noodles),
    the alien signal is genuinely alien (fractal, non-periodic, golden-ratio intervals,
    micro-tonal pairings), Dr. Raj Kapoor challenges Yuki''s approach, Mei Ling Chen
    is an unconventional mentor, the Threshold is psychological (Yuki opening her
    heart and door), and the humming scene provides a genuine human connection. All
    four required beats are clearly executed. The narrative quality is high, with
    good pacing, evocative language, and effective tension building.'
