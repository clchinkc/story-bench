  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Excellent execution of required narrative beats. Act 1 setup
    is strong with the demolition notice and Mrs. Kim introduction. Act 2 confrontation
    (Jenna''s arrival, the argument about his wife''s death) is emotionally resonant
    and specific. Act 3 resolution is hopeful but measured—David relocates rather
    than winning an unrealistic victory. Food symbolism is well-deployed: kimchi represents
    his wife''s legacy and memory (used twice—the jar opening and Mrs. Kim''s gift
    of doenjang jjigae). David''s grief is palpable throughout without explicit statement
    (''his throat tightened,'' the blame he carries, the crack inside him). Jenna''s
    estrangement has a specific, believable cause: she blames the restaurant for her
    mother''s overwork and death. Mrs. Kim effectively represents something to David—continuity,
    community, and a mirror of his own loss. Korean cultural elements include: ''Anyonghaseyo''
    greeting, doenjang jjigae, jajangmyeon, the honeymoon trip to Korea, and the concept
    of food carrying memory and love (distinctly Korean philosophy). MINOR GAPS: The
    plan summary was incomplete (cut off mid-sentence), though the output fully compensates.
    The ''hopeful but not unrealistically happy'' ending is well-calibrated—David
    gets a second chance but must leave his beloved restaurant and rebuild elsewhere.
    PACING: Strong three-act structure with clear emotional progression. CHARACTER
    WORK: David''s arc from paralysis to agency to acceptance is earned. Jenna''s
    softening feels genuine rather than manipulative. MRS. KIM: Serves multiple functions
    effectively—customer, grief mirror, wisdom figure. MINOR WEAKNESS: The neighborhood
    organizing subplot (days 2-3) could have been developed slightly more to show
    David''s agency, though it''s sufficient as written.'
