  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with clear three-act structure, specific
    day-by-day beats, and concrete character arcs. Output adheres closely to plan
    with strong execution. Constraint analysis: (1) Food symbolism—SATISFIED: kimchi
    as preservation metaphor (Act I), dumplings as shared learning (Act II), food
    as memory throughout. (2) David''s grief—SATISFIED: implicit through place settings,
    recipe box handling, inability to articulate loss, emotional tightening. (3) Daughter''s
    estrangement cause—SATISFIED: specific and believable (missed graduation due to
    restaurant emergency; lack of shared culinary knowledge). (4) Regular customer—SATISFIED:
    Mrs. Chen represents continuity, tradition, and widow''s perspective; 15-year
    history established. (5) Hopeful but realistic ending—SATISFIED: restaurant changes
    hands, cooking classes begin, Sarah and David reconnect through recipes, but no
    fantasy resolution; bittersweet tone maintained. (6) Korean cultural element beyond
    food—PARTIALLY SATISFIED: hanbok appears twice (Mrs. Chen''s story, displayed
    in new space) but feels somewhat secondary; temple reference adds depth but could
    be more integrated. MINOR GAPS: Hanbok element, while present, doesn''t carry
    equal narrative weight to kimchi symbolism. The ending, while hopeful, edges slightly
    toward ''unrealistically happy'' with the convenient Kim family buyer and immediate
    cooking class setup—though this is mitigated by the bittersweet tone and David''s
    acceptance of loss. EXECUTION QUALITY: Pacing is excellent across three acts.
    Dialogue feels natural. Sensory details (amber light, barley tea aroma, cabbage
    texture) ground the narrative. Character development is earned through action
    rather than exposition. The confrontation scene effectively uses physical action
    (Sarah chopping cabbage) to externalize emotional conflict. Narrative tension
    builds appropriately and resolves without melodrama.'
