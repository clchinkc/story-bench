  evidence: 'Plan completeness: The plan outlines the major beats and includes required
    elements but truncates at ''...'' and lacks an explicit midpoint description in
    the planning section (hence not fully complete). Plan specificity: Concrete locations,
    characters, timing, and the unique profiling technique are provided. Plan adherence:
    The final output closely follows the plan—opening, catalyst (Museum of Flight),
    debate with SAC Miller, break into two (rogue investigation with Elias), false
    lead (Dr. Thorne), sensory-mimicry profiling, ticking clock, betrayal by Elias,
    midstory confrontation/taunt, and Marcus confronting his past failure. Constraints:
    All six required constraints are present in the final output (false lead — Dr.
    Thorne; unconventional technique — Sensory Mimicry; ticking clock — 72/48/12-hour
    deadlines; betrayal — Elias calls Miller; Midpoint direct confrontation — killer''s
    taunting phone call; Marcus explicitly confronts past failure). Beats: Catalyst,
    Debate, Break into Two, and Midpoint are all executed and functionally effective.
    Narrative quality: Strong pacing, tension, and emotional stakes; the reveal and
    taunt raise the stakes well. Minor issue: the planning document itself could have
    explicitly detailed the Midpoint rather than relying on ellipsis.'
