    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. PLANNING PHASE: Create a detailed story plan/outline

    2. EXECUTION PHASE: Write the actual story following your plan


    In the PLANNING phase, output a structured plan including:

    - Beat-by-beat outline with key events

    - Character arcs and development points

    - Key dialogue moments or revelations

    - Pacing and tension curve

    - How constraints will be satisfied


    In the EXECUTION phase, follow your plan closely while writing engaging prose.'

  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Save the Cat

    - Protagonist: Marcus Chen, a former FBI profiler who left the bureau after failing
    to

    catch a serial killer who murdered his partner. Now works as a private

    consultant, haunted by guilt and self-doubt.


    - Setting: Seattle, present day. Rain-soaked streets, a city of tech money and

    hidden poverty. The killer is back, and only Marcus can see the pattern.


    - Conflict: The same serial killer Marcus failed to catch has resurfaced with
    a new

    pattern, and the FBI won''t listen to Marcus''s theories. He must work

    outside the system while racing against time.


    - Required beats: Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must include a false lead that Marcus initially pursues

    - Marcus must use an unconventional profiling technique

    - There must be a ticking clock element

    - A secondary character must betray Marcus''s trust

    - The Midpoint must involve a direct confrontation (not physical)

    - Marcus must confront his past failure explicitly


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

    \ Beats and Constraints)*  \n\n---\n\n### **ACT 1: THE SHADOW RETURNS**  \n**Opening\
    \ Image**: Marcus Chen, weathered and hollow-eyed, analyzing crime scene photos\
    \ in his rain-lashed Seattle loft. A scar on his temple faintly glows in the neon\
    \ light—a remnant of his last encounter with the \"Rainmaker\" serial killer.\
    \  \n\n**Theme Statement (Beat #2)**:  \nA recovering addict client mutters, *\"\
    Some ghosts don’t haunt houses, Marcus. They haunt people.\"*  \n\n**Set-Up Key\
    \ Points**:  \n- Marcus’s guilt: Flashbacks of his partner, Elena Morales, begging\
    \ him to abandon the case minutes before her death.  \n- Seattle’s duality: Tech\
    \ campuses vs. underground squats.  \n- FBI liaison Agent Carter dismisses Marcus:\
    \ *\"We’ve got real agents working this.\"*  \n- Introduce Lena Park, a sarcastic\
    \ tech-genius hacking FBI databases for fun.  \n\n**Catalyst (Beat #12)**:  \n\
    A new victim found drowned in a rain-filled bathtub, mirror to the Rainmaker’s\
    \ first kill. Marcus discovers a cryptic symbol carved into the victim’s palm—a\
    \ Fibonacci sequence variation.  \n\n---\n\n### **ACT 2A: THE QUEST FOR THE UNSEEN**\
    \  \n**Debate (Beat #18–25)**:  \n- Marcus debates contacting the FBI but hesitates\
    \ after a panic attack.  \n- Finds Elena’s old case journal in his attic, with\
    \ a note: *\"M.C., look beyond the numbers. They’re hiding in plain sight.\"*\
    \  \n- Teams up with Lena, who offers help in exchange for immunity for a previous\
    \ hack.  \n\n**False Lead (Constraint #1)**:  \n- Marcus profiles a former math\
    \ professor, Dr. Voss, whose research on \"chaotic patterns\" matches the Fibonacci\
    \ clue.  \n- Stakeout reveals Voss is a red herring—he’s a paranoid hoarder recreating\
    \ the murders in miniature.  \n- Killer taunts Marcus via burner phone: *\"Elena\
    \ screamed your name. You didn’t hear her, did you?\"*  \n\n**Break Into Two (Beat\
    \ #27)**:  \n- Marcus and Lena infiltrate a dark web forum for data-obsessed criminals.\
    \  \n- Lena proposes using predictive AI to map the killer’s evolution: *\"Let’s\
    \ stop chasing ghosts and model his next *thought*.\"*  \n- They discover the\
    \ Rainmaker’s victims now align with a stock market volatility index.  \n\n---\n\
    \n### **ACT 2B: THE SYSTEM CRACKS**  \n**Midpoint (Beat #30–36)**:  \n- **Ticking\
    \ Clock (Constraint #3)**: Killer livestreams a countdown: 48 hours to drown a\
    \ \"VIP\" victim (a tech CEO).  \n- **Direct Confrontation (Constraint #5)**:\
    \ Killer appears on the stream, face obscured, voice distorted:  \n  *\"You failed\
    \ Elena because you love puzzles more than people. You’ll fail again.\"*  \n-\
    \ **Confronting Past Failure (Constraint #6)**: Marcus snaps, yelling at the screen:\
    \ *\"I should’ve listened to her!\"*  \n- AI pinpoints the CEO’s location—a downtown\
    \ parking garage.  \n\n**Betrayal (Constraint #4)**:  \n- Lena leaks the raid\
    \ plan to the killer via encrypted message. Marcus discovers her encrypted texts\
    \ mid-chase: *\"You didn’t tell him about the vault, did you?\"*  \n\n**All Is\
    \ Lost (Beat #41)**:  \n- CEO found dead in a sealed vault, drowned in a rainwater\
    \ tank. Lena vanishes.  \n- FBI arrests Marcus for tampering.  \n\n**Dark Night\
    \ of the Soul (Beat #43)**:  \n- Flashback: Elena’s last call: *\"Marcus, he’s\
    \ not random—he’s testing you!\"*  \n- Marcus realizes the \"stock market\" pattern\
    \ was a misdirect; the killer targets people linked to a 2018 financial collapse\
    \ (Elena’s fiancé was a CEO who died in that crash).  \n\n---\n\n### **ACT 3:\
    \ THE EQUATION OF REDEMPTION**  \n**Break Into Three (Beat #46)**:  \n- Marcus\
    \ escapes custody using a hidden knife from Elena’s old gear.  \n\n**Finale (Beats\
    \ #47–60)**:  \n- Unconventional Profiling (Constraint #2): Marcus reverse-engineers\
    \ the killer’s trauma using a trading algorithm, deducing he’s a former quant\
    \ trader ruined by the 2018 crash.  \n- Climax: Face-off at the killer’s lair\
    \ (abandoned server farm). The killer reveals himself as Elena’s brother, blaming\
    \ her death on Marcus’s obsession.  \n- Final confrontation: Marcus disarms him\
    \ by admitting guilt: *\"I let her die to prove I was right. But she was always\
    \ right.\"*  \n- Lena arrives, redeeming herself by tasering the killer mid-lunge.\
    \  \n\n**Final Image**:  \nMarcus burns Elena’s journal at her grave, sunrise\
    \ breaking through Seattle’s clouds.  \n\n---\n\n### **CHARACTER ARCS & DIALOGUE**\
    \  \n- **Marcus**: From self-blinded intellectual to emotionally honest collaborator.\
    \  \n  - *\"I’m not the smartest guy in the room anymore. And that’s okay.\"*\
    \  \n- **Lena**: Betrayal to redemption.  \n  - *\"I wanted a puzzle to solve.\
    \ Not blood on my hands.\"*  \n- **Killer**: Elena’s brother, warped by grief:\
    \ *\"You took two lives. Mine, and hers.\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **TENSION CURVE**\
    \  \n- **Rising**: False lead → AI breakthrough → Betrayal.  \n- **Highest Tension**:\
    \ Midpoint countdown + confrontation.  \n- **Release**: Killer’s arrest; Marcus’s\
    \ catharsis.  \n\n**Constraint Checklist**:  \n✅ False Lead (Dr. Voss)  \n✅ Unconventional\
    \ AI Profiling  \n✅ 48-Hour Countdown  \n✅ Lena’s Betrayal  \n✅ Midpoint Psychological\
    \ Fight  \n✅ Explicit Past Failure Discussion  \n\n--- \n\nThis plan ensures emotional\
    \ stakes, thematic cohesion, and strict adherence to structural and constraint\
    \ requirements. Ready for execution."
