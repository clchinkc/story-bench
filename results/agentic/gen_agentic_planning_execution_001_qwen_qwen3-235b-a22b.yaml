    - Character arcs and development points

    - Key dialogue moments or revelations

    - Pacing and tension curve

    - How constraints will be satisfied

  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Save the Cat

    - Protagonist: Marcus Chen, a former FBI profiler who left the bureau after failing
    to

    catch a serial killer who murdered his partner. Now works as a private

    consultant, haunted by guilt and self-doubt.


    - Setting: Seattle, present day. Rain-soaked streets, a city of tech money and

    hidden poverty. The killer is back, and only Marcus can see the pattern.


    - Conflict: The same serial killer Marcus failed to catch has resurfaced with
    a new

    pattern, and the FBI won''t listen to Marcus''s theories. He must work

    outside the system while racing against time.


    - Required beats: Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must include a false lead that Marcus initially pursues

    - Marcus must use an unconventional profiling technique

    - There must be a ticking clock element

    - A secondary character must betray Marcus''s trust

    - The Midpoint must involve a direct confrontation (not physical)

    - Marcus must confront his past failure explicitly


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'
