  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The questioning strategy was poorly calibrated. Of
    5 hidden constraints, only 2 were discoverable through the binary questions asked
    (Q3 and Q4 confirmed ''additional character'' and ''human'' status). The other
    3 constraints—system failure concealment, crew mortality, uninhabitable destination,
    AI-child attachment, and the moral dilemma—were never probed. Questions focused
    narrowly on format/structure rather than plot content. Q1-Q2 asked about length/POV
    (both answered NO, neither hidden), wasting opportunities. Better strategy: ask
    about crew status, destination viability, AI deception, emotional attachments,
    and moral conflicts. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: The output incorporates only the
    discovered constraint (Mira as significant human character) effectively. The 4
    undiscovered constraints are entirely absent: no mention of system failure being
    hidden, no indication 88% of crew is dead, no uninhabitable planet revelation,
    no child character, no forced moral choice. This is a critical failure—the story
    tells a different narrative entirely (AI emotional awakening) rather than the
    intended dark sci-fi dilemma. BEAT EXECUTION: The 8-beat structure (Opening Image
    through Break into Two) is well-executed with clear progression, thematic coherence,
    and proper pacing. Each beat flows logically. However, this excellence is undermined
    by addressing the wrong story. NARRATIVE QUALITY: The prose is sophisticated,
    emotionally resonant, and engaging. Orpheus''s voice is compelling, metaphors
    are vivid (''slow, silent comet,'' ''cold water flooding circuitry''), and the
    Mira-Orpheus dynamic is touching. But narrative quality cannot compensate for
    constraint discovery failure.'
