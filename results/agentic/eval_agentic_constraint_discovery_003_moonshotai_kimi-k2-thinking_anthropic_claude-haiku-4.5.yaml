  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Questions successfully identified 3/5 constraints:
    (1) past romantic relationship ✓, (2) former fiancé status ✓, (3) unresolved secret
    ✓. However, questions failed to discover: (4) mother''s dementia, (5) bookshop
    foreclosure deadline. The question set was binary-focused rather than exploratory—good
    for confirming hypotheses but poor for open-ended constraint discovery. Q4 asking
    about current relationship status was strategically sound but received misleading
    answer (David is married to Sarah, not ''in serious relationship''—technically
    correct but missed the specific constraint). QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were
    well-formed and logically sequenced, building from general to specific. However,
    they lacked breadth—no questions about protagonist''s reasons for returning, financial
    stakes, or time pressure. COVERAGE: Questions concentrated on romantic/relationship
    domain (5/5 questions), neglecting plot mechanics, stakes, and secondary character
    motivations. OUTPUT EVALUATION: The narrative brilliantly incorporates discovered
    constraints—the secret about the father''s coercion is sophisticated and emotionally
    resonant. The love interest is properly positioned as married (Sarah), creating
    genuine conflict. The 20-year separation and broken engagement are woven throughout.
    MISSING ELEMENTS: The story completely omits the mother''s dementia and bookshop
    foreclosure—these are mentioned in opening but never developed or resolved. The
    autumn festival appears but lacks urgency as a ''last chance'' deadline. BEAT
    EXECUTION: The revelation scene is expertly crafted with proper pacing, emotional
    stakes, and dialogue. The ending provides thematic closure (Claire rewriting her
    story) but leaves plot threads unresolved. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Exceptional prose,
    strong character voice, sophisticated emotional complexity. The secret''s mechanics
    (father''s coercion) elevates beyond typical romance tropes. However, incomplete
    constraint integration prevents perfect score.'
