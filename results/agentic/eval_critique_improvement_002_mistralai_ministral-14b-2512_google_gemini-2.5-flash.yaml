  evidence: The critiques consistently highlighted the need for stronger emotional
    complexity and clearer execution of the 'humor before sadness' constraint. The
    revisions, particularly the final one, significantly improved this by making Marcus's
    initial jokes more impactful and the subsequent reveal of his sadness more poignant.
    The 'barking during sex' joke was a direct response to critique feedback for stronger
    humor. The introduction of Lena Chen as a non-naive character who sees through
    Marcus was well-executed and directly addressed a constraint. The moment Marcus
    almost breaks but covers it with a joke ('Wow. You’re really good at this.' He
    forced a grin, but it wobbled like a bad improv bit.) was also a direct response
    to a constraint. The theme being stated by a minor character (Lena) was also well-integrated.
    The craft of comedy writing was shown through Lena's specific notes and the discussion
    of joke structure. The overall narrative quality improved with each revision,
    becoming more nuanced and emotionally resonant while maintaining the initial strengths
    of the writers' room setting and character dynamics.
