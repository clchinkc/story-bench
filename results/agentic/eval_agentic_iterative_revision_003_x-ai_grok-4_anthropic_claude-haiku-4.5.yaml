  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0-1 appear truncated (incomplete), making direct
    comparison difficult. However, V2-V3 show clear refinement: V2 introduces more
    specific cultural detail (''carne asada,'' ''diabetes meds,'' ''worn-out serape,''
    ''piñata shops'') replacing generic language. Final output substantially expands
    with full narrative arc, demonstrating strong iterative development from setup
    through resolution. The progression shows intentional deepening of emotional stakes
    and cultural specificity.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. INTERNAL CONFLICT SHOWN NOT TOLD (0.95/1.0): Mateo''s conflict manifests through
    concrete actions—doodling instead of studying, hiding sketches, lying about the
    bonfire, balling up napkins. His internal state emerges through behavior and physical
    sensation (''pulse hammered,'' ''knot in his gut,'' ''fingers shaky'') rather
    than exposition. Minor: some introspection (''*Man, this is bogus*'') borders
    on telling but remains minimal and character-appropriate.


    2. SPECIFIC GRANDMOTHER MOMENT CRYSTALLIZING CHOICE (1.0/1.0): The pozole scene
    is exceptionally executed. Abuela''s revelation about abandoning her own painting
    in Nogales, the yellowed photo, her cracking voice, the specific detail of Día
    de los Muertos mural work—this moment is concrete, sensory, and emotionally earned.
    It directly precipitates Mateo''s decision (''unlocking a torrent,'' ''choice
    both heartbreaking and inevitable''). This is the narrative fulcrum.


    3. ONE ADULT GENUINELY UNDERSTANDS DILEMMA (1.0/1.0): Mr. Vargas is well-realized.
    His understanding stems from lived experience (''my folks pushed the same''),
    not platitudes. His classroom setting, the acrylics smell, his own misting eyes,
    and his specific story about juggling family expectations while pursuing design
    in Tucson all ground his credibility. He validates complexity rather than offering
    easy answers.


    4. CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY NOT PERFORMATIVE (0.9/1.0): Strong execution: specific
    foods (pozole rojo, hominy from mercado, carne asada, horchata), Spanish integrated
    naturally (''Órale,'' ''mijo,'' ''Escúchame''), cultural references (*La Usurpadora*,
    Día de los Muertos, lowrider murals, border context). Details feel embedded in
    lived experience rather than inserted for color. Minor: ''worn-out serape'' simile,
    while evocative, slightly risks poeticizing rather than grounding. Overall highly
    authentic.


    5. RESOLUTION EARNED THROUGH GROWTH (0.85/1.0): Mateo''s decision to mail the
    UCLA portfolio emerges from accumulated emotional work—Abuela''s revelation, Vargas''s
    mentorship, his own wrestling. The resolution avoids false triumph: he maintains
    family obligations (''kept up translations,'' ''taquería shifts''), suggesting
    earned compromise rather than clean escape. Papá''s ''reluctant nod'' and Abuela''s
    ''bittersweet release'' acknowledge the cost. Strong execution, though the final
    paragraph could deepen the specific emotional weight of his choice.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.88/1.0):

    - Setup/world-building: Excellent (Bisbee setting, family dynamics, dual pulls)

    - Inciting incident: Strong (art scout encounter)

    - Rising tension: Well-paced (bonfire lie, internal friction)

    - Climactic moment: Exceptional (Abuela''s pozole scene)

    - Mentor intervention: Solid (Vargas provides understanding, not solution)

    - Resolution: Good but slightly compressed (portfolio mailing feels slightly rushed
    after emotional buildup)

    - Denouement: Adequate (final paragraph ties threads but lacks visceral specificity)


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.87/1.0):

    Strengths: Sensory richness (heat, smoke, aromas), authentic voice, emotional
    authenticity, complex characterization of Papá (gruff but loving, not villainous),
    Abuela''s agency and wisdom. The prose balances lyricism with specificity—''saguaros
    like silent guardians'' works because it''s grounded in actual landscape observation.


    Weaknesses: Some sentences strain toward poetry at expense of clarity (''complex
    harmony of roots and wings'' is evocative but slightly abstract for the grounded
    tone). The bonfire scene, while functional, feels slightly less vivid than other
    sequences. Minor tense/voice inconsistencies in introspection.


    OVERALL: This is strong work that successfully navigates competing demands. The
    revision process shows clear responsiveness to constraints, with each version
    building specificity and emotional depth. The final output satisfies all five
    constraints while maintaining narrative coherence and authentic voice.'
