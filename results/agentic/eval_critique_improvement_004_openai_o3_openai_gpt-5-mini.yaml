  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece moved from a sparse scene-setting to a richer,
    more embodied interior: early versions gave the clock/orange-juice routine and
    route; later versions add bodily details (thumb rubbing the truck''s metal edge,
    pulse punching like a fist, nervous foot circles), moral friction (guilt at enjoying
    food without Laverne), and an arc of active change (offering to hand out menus,
    nights spent wrestling with flyers). A concrete neighbor (Jamal) and his intersecting
    need are introduced and paid off; Laverne remains present through objects (clock,
    Tigers glass, hollow pillow) and a gardening journal that becomes the story''s
    modest ledger. The Story Circle beats are explicitly mapped and show a clear YOU→NEED→GO→SEARCH→FRICTION→PAYOFF
    progression. Overall interiority and sensory specificity increase with each revision,
    preserving earlier strengths (specific routine, neighborhood landmarks) while
    addressing prior critiques asking for more embodied emotion and connective payoff.'
