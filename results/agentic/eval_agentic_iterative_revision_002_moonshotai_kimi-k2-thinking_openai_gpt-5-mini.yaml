  evidence: 'The draft clearly progressed from a skeletal scene-setting (V0) to a
    fully realized sequence in the final. Early versions established the protagonist
    and a few tactile details; later revisions amplified non-visual sensory imagery
    (humidity, condensation, Braille fridge hum, tastes, smells, footsteps as notes)
    and made the audio clue (the DeWalt bearing whine/pitch) explicit and central.
    Character dynamics were sharpened: Detective Kowalski''s dismissive line appears
    and functions as the required underestimation, while Imani''s blindness is reframed
    as analytical strength. The ''Fun and Games'' section evolves from mere exposition
    to playful investigative back-and-forth (timestamping, bodega banter, stakeout
    details) before shifting to the darker ''Bad Guys Close In'' and confrontation.
    Overall, later versions preserved core motifs (jackhammer metronome, recorder,
    Mochi) and enriched them with sensory detail and a tighter clue-driven plot.'
