  evidence: 'The plan is comprehensive, addressing all constraints and beats with
    good specificity. The final output adheres very closely to the plan. All beats
    (Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Refusal of the Call, Meeting the Mentor) are
    executed well. Most constraints are satisfied: Yuki''s isolation is shown through
    specific behaviors (nutrient paste, headphones, dismissing sister, AI assistant,
    aversion to ''team''), the alien signal is genuinely alien (geometric patterns,
    discordant frequencies, irregular light bursts), a colleague challenges Yuki''s
    approach (Aris Thorne, though he''s more introduced than challenging here), and
    the mentor figure is unconventional (Rostova, who acts as a mentor by forcing
    Yuki out of her comfort zone). The ''Threshold'' is not explicitly psychological
    yet, and the ''moment of genuine human connection'' is missing. The narrative
    quality is strong, with good pacing and tension building.'
