  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is exceptionally thorough and well-structured. All 6
    constraints are explicitly satisfied: (1) False lead with David Kincaid is credible
    and pursued aggressively through warrant/surveillance; (2) Unconventional technique
    ''psychic geography'' combining astrology/ley lines is creative and integrated
    throughout; (3) Ticking clock escalates logically (48→24→12 hours); (4) Betrayal
    by Dr. Thorne is set up early and pays off at midpoint; (5) Midpoint confrontation
    is psychological (gala scene with Kincaid, bathroom revelation) not physical;
    (6) Past failure explicitly confronted in bathroom mirror scene with Rachel''s
    memory. All 4 required beats present: Catalyst (murder discovery, false lead intro),
    Debate (Elena visit, PTSD flashbacks, unconventional technique reveal), Break
    into Two (war room setup, technique validation, false lead pursuit), Midpoint
    (gala confrontation, past failure admission, betrayal reveal, Sarah abduction).
    MINOR WEAKNESSES: Plan is dense—some execution risk in Act Two pacing. The ''psychic
    geography'' technique, while creative, could strain credibility if not handled
    carefully in prose. Thorne''s motivation for betrayal (career-mindedness) is mentioned
    but could be more deeply established. The final revelation that ''killer IS the
    profile'' is intriguing but needs careful setup to avoid feeling contrived. EXECUTION
    QUALITY: Output follows plan closely with strong atmospheric detail (rain motifs,
    Seattle geography), clear character arcs, and escalating tension. Dialogue is
    sharp and purposeful. The structure supports thematic exploration of redemption
    vs. perfectionism effectively.'
