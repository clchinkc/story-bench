  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were discoverable
    through the questions asked: (1) Weapon forging requirement - YES, directly confirmed;
    (2) No direct magic use - PARTIALLY, Q2 asked about latent abilities and got YES,
    but Q4 confirmed fire/metal manipulation magic, creating contradiction; (3) Three-day
    time limit - NOT DISCOVERED, no temporal questions asked; (4) Mentor death - NOT
    DISCOVERED, no questions about mentor fate; (5) Father''s failed heroism - NOT
    DISCOVERED, no backstory questions. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were reasonably
    well-formed and binary, but lacked strategic depth. Q2 and Q4 created logical
    tension (latent magic vs. no direct magic use). Missing temporal, relational,
    and backstory dimensions. QUESTION COVERAGE: Focused heavily on protagonist abilities
    and weapon mechanics; neglected time pressure, mentor role, and family legacy.
    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Output incorporates weapon forging (YES), personal sacrifice/magic
    loss (YES), and faceless antagonist (YES). FAILS to include: three-day deadline
    (no urgency markers), mentor death (Thorne survives), father''s legacy (absent
    entirely). BEAT EXECUTION: Ordeal sequence is present and climactic, but lacks
    the mentor sacrifice beat and temporal pressure that would elevate stakes. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Strong prose, clear character voice, coherent magic system, satisfying
    emotional arc of sacrifice. However, incomplete constraint integration undermines
    thematic depth—the story would be significantly richer with mentor death and paternal
    legacy elements.'
