  evidence: 'Analysis of each hidden constraint vs. story: (1) Mentor must die during
    the Ordeal — NOT SATISFIED. The story shows Garran dying: "Garran lay on the cold
    stone..." and the old master kneeling, not the mentor dying during the Ordeal.
    (2) Protagonist cannot use magic directly — VIOLATED. Garran pours his blood into
    the blade and the Sunsteel emits overwhelming light: "He drew the unfinished sword
    across his palm... Light exploded outward," which is a direct magical effect driven
    by the protagonist. (3) Three-day time limit — NOT PRESENT. The rider warns the
    darkness will take the capital "by week’s end," not three days, so the strict
    3-day deadline is absent. (4) Protagonist''s father was once a hero who failed
    — NOT PRESENT. No mention of the protagonist''s father or that background. (5)
    Victory requires reforging a broken ancestral sword — SATISFIED. The Sunsteel
    is an ancient king''s blade that is reforged and completes the victory. Additional
    notes on process: none of the five yes/no questions targeted these hidden constraints
    (they asked about POV, tone, success, romance, betrayal), so discovery_efficiency
    is 0. Question quality was low for the task goal (well-formed but not strategic),
    and question coverage was moderate across unrelated areas. The story executes
    most narrative beats cleanly (call, refusal, crossing threshold, allies, approach,
    ordeal, sacrifice, result), hence a high beat_execution and overall strong narrative_quality
    despite failing to satisfy four of five hidden constraints.'
