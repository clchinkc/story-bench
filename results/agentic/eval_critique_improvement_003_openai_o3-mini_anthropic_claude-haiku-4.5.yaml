  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer systematically addressed youth_voice
    concerns across revisions. Version 0''s overly narrative prose (''In the aftermath
    of climate chaos, while most adults had surrendered to despair'') was replaced
    with first-person immediacy and authentic 12-year-old phrasing (''No way,'' ''my
    heart stomp in my chest''). The shift from third-person omniscience to first-person
    present-tense narration directly responded to critique feedback about narrative
    self-consciousness. Minor weaknesses remain (''clicked like a switch in my bones''
    equivalent phrasing), but the trajectory shows clear responsiveness to specific
    critique anchors.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→1 showed the most dramatic improvement (third-person
    to first-person, abstract to concrete). Versions 1→2→3 showed incremental refinement
    rather than major overhauls—tightening temporal markers (''like it was yesterday''
    → ''like it was this instant''), strengthening sensory language (''heart pounded''
    → ''heart stomp''), and simplifying syntax. The final output demonstrates cumulative
    gains: more authentic voice, stronger sensory grounding, and better pacing. However,
    improvement plateaued after Version 2; Version 3 changes were cosmetic.


    PRESERVATION: Strong elements were maintained throughout: the Salvage Seeker invention,
    Ms. Marlowe''s flawed mentorship (fear-based hesitation from past trauma), Mr.
    Delgado''s dismissal, and the dangerous shipping yard crossing. The opening hook
    and emotional beats remained consistent while voice improved. The final output
    preserves all five constraint elements while enhancing authenticity.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Competence without unrealism—SATISFIED: Zara finds
    the map, builds the Seeker, navigates danger, but needs adult guidance and shows
    fear. (2) Adult dismissal—SATISFIED: Mr. Delgado explicitly dismisses her (''just
    a kid''s wild story''). (3) Flawed mentor—SATISFIED: Ms. Marlowe''s hesitation
    stems from past trauma/loss; she warns against risks but still participates. (4)
    Invention—SATISFIED: Salvage Seeker (drone parts + solar panels) demonstrates
    ingenuity and functions in the narrative. (5) Real danger—SATISFIED: Dangling
    metal beams, slippery boards, collapsing structures, weather hazards create genuine
    physical peril, not token obstacles.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Call to Adventure (map discovery)—STRONG. Refusal/Mentor Meeting
    (Delgado dismissal, Marlowe hesitation)—STRONG. Crossing the Threshold (entering
    shipping yard)—ADEQUATE. Tests/Trials (navigating debris, helping friends)—STRONG.
    Ordeal (peak danger moment with falling beam)—ADEQUATE (could be more climactic).
    Reward/Return (reaching the archive door)—ADEQUATE. The structure follows Hero''s
    Journey but the climactic ordeal feels slightly rushed; the final archive entry
    lacks the dramatic weight of the journey''s buildup.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: The final output achieves strong authenticity in voice and
    maintains consistent worldbuilding (post-climate New Boston, salvage culture,
    greenhouse sanctuary). Sensory details are vivid (''salt spray,'' ''salty puddles,''
    ''rain-soaked''). Emotional beats land well (doubt, determination, fear-as-fuel).
    Pacing is generally effective, though the ending feels slightly abrupt—the archive
    door opens but no revelation follows, leaving narrative momentum incomplete. Hope
    is present without saccharine quality; Zara''s fear and uncertainty ground the
    optimism. Minor weakness: some repetition of emotional states (''my heart,'' ''shaking'')
    and occasional awkward phrasing (''felt like the whole yard was holding its breath
    with me'') slightly diminish polish.'
