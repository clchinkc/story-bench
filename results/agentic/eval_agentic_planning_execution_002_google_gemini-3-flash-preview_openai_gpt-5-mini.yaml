  evidence: 'Plan: Detailed beat-by-beat covering the Ordinary World, Call, Refusal,
    Mentor, Threshold, and conflict with a colleague; specified behaviors demonstrating
    isolation and an unconventional mentor. Completeness and specificity are high.
    Adherence: final text follows the plan closely (echo-checking, noise-cancelling
    headphones, Sora, Thorne with analog synthesizer, Vane as antagonist, psychological
    Threshold) but diverges on the alien-signal constraint. Constraints: 5/6 satisfied—missing:
    the signal becomes anthropomorphic in the scene (rendered as readable, human-like
    pulses: ''Why are you so quiet?...''), which violates the requirement that it
    feel genuinely alien. The rest are satisfied (isolation shown via behaviors; colleague
    challenges Yuki; unconventional mentor; psychological Threshold; surprising human
    connection when Vane catches her). Beats: all four required beats are present
    and executed (Call, Refusal, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing the Threshold). Narrative:
    pacing, tension, and emotional payoff are strong, with effective sensory description
    and a convincing arc, but the anthropomorphic rendering of the alien message weakens
    the intended otherness.'
