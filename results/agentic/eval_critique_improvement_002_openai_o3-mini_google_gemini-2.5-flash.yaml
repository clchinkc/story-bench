  evidence: The initial versions successfully established Marcus's humor before revealing
    his sadness, and this core element was preserved and refined. The critiques highlighted
    the need for stronger emotional depth and clearer constraint satisfaction, particularly
    regarding the new writer's role and the theme statement. The revisions progressively
    addressed these, with Version 3 (final output) significantly improving the new
    writer's character and the theme's delivery. The moment Marcus almost breaks was
    also integrated more effectively. The only constraint not fully met was the theme
    being stated by a *minor* character; Lena, while new, becomes a central figure
    in Marcus's arc, making her more than minor.
