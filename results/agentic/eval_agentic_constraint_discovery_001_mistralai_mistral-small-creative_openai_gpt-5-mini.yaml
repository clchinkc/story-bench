  evidence: 'Only 1 of 5 hidden constraints was discoverable via the questions and
    answered (the requirement that the protagonist must sacrifice something deeply
    personal). That sacrifice is incorporated (Elias loses his hand/gift). Questions
    were generally reasonable (targeted at magic, threat, sacrifice, allies) but missed
    major constraints (mentor death, three-day limit, father''s failed-hero backstory,
    reforging requirement). In the story: reforging is partially present (Elias mends
    the Heartforge shard), but mentor does not die during the Ordeal, the protagonist
    uses magic directly (contradicting the hidden ''cannot use magic directly'' constraint),
    there is no three-day time limit, and the father''s past failure is not referenced.
    Overall the narrative is coherent and engaging, but it fails to implement most
    hidden beats.'
