  evidence: 'V0–V2 are essentially identical, a partial opening. V3 introduces stronger
    non-visual sensory detail (J-line as a ''stomach ache'', bristles ''methodical
    as breathing''), improving atmosphere. The final revision expands into a full,
    coherent story: it establishes catalyst (Jules and Derek interaction), includes
    an engaging ''Fun and Games'' investigation (research, braille note-taking, slowed
    audio reveal), introduces the crucial audio clue (the Zippo clicking and the slowed
    recording revealing Marcus Webb), shows initial underestimation (Derek''s condescension),
    escalates to danger (brick through window), and resolves with raids/arrests. Good
    elements from earlier versions (the sound-focused premise, setting, characters)
    are preserved while plot, stakes, and sensory detail are substantially developed.'
