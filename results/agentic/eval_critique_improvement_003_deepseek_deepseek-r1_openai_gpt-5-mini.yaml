  evidence: 'Across the revision trajectory the piece moved from a strong opening
    paragraph to a fully realized set of Hero''s Journey beats (Ordinary World, Call
    to Adventure, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing the Threshold) with richer stakes and
    world detail. Strengths called out in critiques—youthful physical details (''tongue
    poking between her teeth''), punchy lines (''Nope. But it floats.''), and Zara''s
    practical ingenuity (the salvage-built water purifier)—are preserved. The mentor''s
    specific flaw (trauma and avoidance after losing his daughter and leg) and an
    adult''s dismissive ''kid'' attitude are present as requested. The crossing contains
    concrete, life-threatening danger (collapsing skyscraper debris, cracked viewport,
    flooding, rebar). Where responsiveness is weaker: critics aimed at fine-tuning
    youth-voice nuance, but revisions largely preserved existing voice rather than
    substantially reshaping it, so the author addressed scene, stakes, and structure
    more than the subtle voice critiques.'
