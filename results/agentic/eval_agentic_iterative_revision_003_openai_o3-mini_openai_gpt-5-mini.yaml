  evidence: 'Version 0 established Mateo and his burdens but mostly told his inner
    conflict. Version 1 tightened language and hinted at an internal storm but still
    leaned on telling. Version 2 introduced Doña Elena and concrete domestic details
    (huevos rancheros, madre’s reminders), shifting toward showing through small actions.
    Version 3 and the final draft added the decisive market scene with Doña Elena,
    the trembling acceptance letter, and the family dinner confrontation—these scenes
    crystallize the choice and give an earned arc to Mateo’s decision. Good elements
    (setting, abuela, notebook, the tension between duty and desire) were preserved
    and deepened. Remaining weaknesses: some lines still explicitly tell Mateo’s feelings
    (“heart that felt both chained...”), and a few cultural details border on familiar
    touchpoints rather than fully lived specifics. Overall, four constraints are clearly
    met (grandmother moment; an adult understanding Mateo; culturally specific elements
    integrated; resolution earned), while the "show, don’t tell" constraint is only
    partially satisfied, preventing a perfect score.'
