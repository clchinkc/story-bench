  evidence: Across revisions the piece preserved its original strength—Sarah's procedural
    actions—and introduced targeted fixes in response to critiques. Version 0 established
    method through action but relied more on exposition and lacked a clear narrative
    role for the fog. By Version 2 the fog was made an active obstacle (thickening
    from the harbor mouth, obscuring pilings and drag marks) and Sarah's speed and
    methodical checklist were emphasized. The final version adds the local secret
    (Whitmore's evasiveness about Morrison), tightens the hint to Sarah's past case
    earlier in the opening lines, and ends on a deliberate moment of choice rather
    than resolution. Overall the changes improved focus and narrative purpose while
    keeping the original methodical characterization intact.
