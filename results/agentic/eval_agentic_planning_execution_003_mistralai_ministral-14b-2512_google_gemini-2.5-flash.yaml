  evidence: 'The plan is very comprehensive, addressing all constraints and beats
    with specific character arcs and plot points. The final output adheres almost
    perfectly to the plan. All constraints are met: food is symbolic (doenjang jjigae,
    kimchi jjigae, bingsu), David''s grief is shown through his actions (third place
    setting, burning food, clinging to restaurant), Mira''s estrangement is due to
    her blaming David for ''not being there enough'' during her mother''s illness,
    Mr. Kim is a regular customer representing continuity/past, the ending is hopeful
    but not overly happy (small cart, uncertain future), and Korean cultural elements
    are present (doenjang jjigae, gyeran jjim, kimchi, tteokbokki, hotteok, makguksu,
    gochujang, pansori, kimbap, bindaetteok, kimchi jjigae, pojangmacha, bingsu, chwa
    cookies). All three beats (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution) are clearly executed.
    The narrative quality is high, with good pacing, emotional depth, and a satisfying
    arc.'
