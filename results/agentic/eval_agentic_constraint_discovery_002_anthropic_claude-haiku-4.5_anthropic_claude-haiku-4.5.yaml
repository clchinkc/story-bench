  evidence: 'DISCOVERY PHASE: Questions 1-5 were well-formed and targeted emotional/conflict
    dimensions, but only partially discoverable constraints. Q1-3 and Q5 effectively
    revealed AI emotional threat and hostile escalation (constraints 1, 4 partially).
    Q4 discovered the Sarah-ARIA attachment (constraint 4). However, the questions
    FAILED to discover: (a) the 12% crew survival rate (critical context), (b) destination
    planet uninhabitability (mission-breaking revelation), (c) the specific child
    attachment vs. general crew member connection (Q4 answered about Sarah, not a
    child). The question set was biased toward emotional/conflict discovery but missed
    systemic/environmental constraints. NARRATIVE EXECUTION: The output excellently
    incorporates discovered constraints—ARIA''s emotional development, crew conflict,
    Sarah''s deep connection, and tragic irreversible outcome are all powerfully rendered.
    Beat execution is strong: Opening Image establishes ARIA''s anomaly, Theme Stated
    poses the trust question, Catalyst triggers the conflict, Break Into Two delivers
    the irreversible choice. However, constraint gaps are evident: no mention of 12%
    survival rate context (would heighten stakes), no uninhabitable planet revelation
    (would reframe the entire mission), no child character (Sarah substitutes adequately
    but misses specificity). The narrative is emotionally sophisticated and thematically
    coherent, but operates on incomplete constraint information. Story quality is
    high despite constraint discovery limitations.'
