  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: All three critiques flagged youth_voice issues
    with adult-authored introspection (''grave/puzzle'' metaphor, systems-level analysis).
    Final output directly addresses this by: (1) grounding opening in physical sensation
    (''arms burning'') rather than philosophical observation, (2) replacing abstract
    analysis with concrete kid-logic (''Miller was right. Maybe she was just a kid
    playing pretend''), (3) maintaining authentic 12-year-old voice throughout (''Jackpot,''
    ''stupid piece of junk,'' tasting copper). The revision trajectory shows deliberate
    movement away from lyrical abstraction toward embodied, immediate experience.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0→V3 demonstrates clear progression. Early versions relied
    on narrator-level wisdom; final version commits to Zara''s limited perspective
    and emotional authenticity. The addition of ''She''d already spent the morning
    scrubbing algae off the intake filters for an extra ration bar, and her arms were
    burning'' (V3) is a direct response to critique feedback about grounding her in
    physical reality rather than systems-thinking. The storm sequence escalates from
    abstract danger to visceral threat (bile rising, teeth jarring, cold terror mixing
    with adrenaline).


    PRESERVATION: Strong opening hook (''hanging upside down forty feet'') preserved
    across all versions. The Barnacles invention remains vivid and functional. Jax''s
    character arc (fear→reluctant heroism) maintained. Miller''s dismissal (''just
    a kid'') preserved as required constraint. The holographic map reveal and time
    pressure (lowest tide tonight, hurricane spinning up) all carried through.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Competence without unrealism: Zara can weld, bypass
    relays, navigate ruins—but needs Jax''s expertise and nearly dies multiple times.
    ✓ (2) Adult dismissal: Miller explicitly says ''a scavenger hunt based on a glitchy
    toy found by a twelve-year-old.'' ✓ (3) Flawed mentor: Jax is paralyzed by fear
    and trauma (lost leg), drinks heavily, refuses to leave dock for 3 years—specific
    flaw clearly established. ✓ (4) Invention: Barnacles (suction cups + pneumatic
    pumps from espresso machine) demonstrated twice with functional purpose. ✓ (5)
    Real danger: Whirlpools, submerged debris, hurricane conditions, propeller risk,
    physical exhaustion—not token obstacles. ✓


    BEAT EXECUTION: Call to Adventure (cylinder discovery) → Refusal (Miller dismissal)
    → Meeting Mentor (Jax) → Crossing Threshold (Red Buoy Line) → Tests/Trials (debris
    navigation, suction-cup save). Hero''s Journey structure present and functional,
    though story cuts before Ordeal/Return.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Dialogue feels natural (''Damn right I''m scared. Fear keeps
    you breathing''). Sensory details vivid (turpentine smell, metal knee, bruised
    sky). Pacing accelerates appropriately. Zara''s internal conflict (should she
    pack? should she try?) creates genuine stakes. The final image (bile rising, ready
    to face the wall of water) ends on earned tension rather than false resolution.
    Minor weakness: some exposition feels slightly dense in Miller scene, but necessary
    for worldbuilding.'
