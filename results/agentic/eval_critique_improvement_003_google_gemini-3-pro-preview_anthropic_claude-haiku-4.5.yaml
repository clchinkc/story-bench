  evidence: 'CRITICAL FAILURE: The submission remains incomplete across all versions,
    terminating mid-sentence (''With a grunt of effort that made''). This is a fundamental
    structural problem that prevents evaluation of most criteria. CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS
    (0.4): Critiques identified incompleteness as the primary issue. Revisions show
    minor cosmetic changes (hot soup → wet wool blanket; added Scrap-Snatcher description)
    but fail to address the core problem—completing the narrative. The writer appears
    to have abandoned the task rather than finish it. IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.3):
    Versions 0-2 show marginal refinement in sensory detail and voice consistency.
    Version 3 onwards plateau or regress—the final output is identical to Version
    3, suggesting no further development. The trajectory is flat and incomplete. PRESERVATION
    (0.5): The opening voice work (Zara''s muttering, the hot-soup humidity metaphor)
    is maintained across revisions, which is positive. However, preservation of strengths
    is moot when the work is unfinished. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.2/1.0): Only 1
    of 5 constraints can be partially verified: (1) Zara''s competence—partially shown
    through the Scrap-Snatcher invention (0.4/1.0 for this constraint alone); (2)
    Adult dismissal—NOT present in fragment; (3) Flawed mentor—NOT introduced; (4)
    Invention—YES, Scrap-Snatcher is creative and age-appropriate (1.0/1.0); (5) Real
    danger crossing—NOT reached. BEAT_EXECUTION (0.0): Hero''s Journey beats cannot
    be evaluated on a fragment. No call to adventure, refusal, mentor meeting, crossing
    threshold, tests, ordeal, reward, return, or resolution are present. NARRATIVE_QUALITY
    (0.3): The opening is competent—vivid sensory work, authentic 12-year-old voice
    in dialogue, creative invention description. But competence in 300 words of an
    incomplete story does not constitute a finished narrative. The work reads as a
    strong opening abandoned mid-execution. This is a submission failure, not a revision
    success.'
