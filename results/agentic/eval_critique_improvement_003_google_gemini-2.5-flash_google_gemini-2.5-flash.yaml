  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on 'youth_voice'. The initial versions
    had some lines that felt too philosophical or sage for a 12-year-old. The revisions,
    particularly in the final output, successfully addressed this by replacing or
    rephrasing these lines. For example, 'They called it 'junk.' She called it 'parts.''
    was changed to 'They called it 'junk.' She called it 'parts' – for anything.'
    which is a subtle but effective shift. The 'Solutions are down there...' line
    was replaced with 'There *has* to be stuff down there,' she’d think, polishing
    a lens. 'Good stuff. People just stopped looking.' which is much more authentic
    for a young character. The addition of 'Was he right? Am I just a kid with toys?'
    directly addresses the self-doubt aspect highlighted in Critique 2 as a strong
    point. The other constraints (adult dismissal, flawed mentor, invention, real
    danger) were already well-established and preserved throughout the revisions.
    The narrative quality is strong, and the beats are well-executed, leading to a
    compelling start to the story.
