  evidence: 'PLAN QUALITY: The plan is exceptionally detailed with specific events,
    dialogue, and character beats. All six constraints are explicitly addressed in
    the planning phase with clear notation of where each is satisfied. The three-act
    structure is clearly mapped with concrete turning points. Minor gap: the plan
    preview cuts off mid-sentence at ''Beat 4: The Me...'' but the final output compensates
    fully.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (6/6): (1) Food symbolism appears twice—kimchi as preservation
    of memory/grief (opening and jar at end), bibimbap as ritual and connection. (2)
    David''s grief for Miyoung is pervasive but implicit: the apron, inability to
    speak her name, the Jesa shrine, the hospital bracelet, the photo—never explicitly
    stated as ''I grieve.'' (3) Estrangement cause is specific and believable: David
    prioritized the restaurant during Sarah''s post-divorce crisis, missing her graduation
    for a Jesa ceremony; she explicitly states ''You used her to hide from me.'' (4)
    Mrs. Chen is a regular customer (Wednesday ritual) who represents loyalty, wisdom,
    and a warning against stagnation. (5) Ending is hopeful but earned: David will
    volunteer, move to California, honor Miyoung through living rather than preservation—not
    a fantasy resolution. (6) Korean cultural element beyond food: the Jesa table
    (memorial shrine with tablet, offerings, ritual), a central plot device.


    BEAT EXECUTION (3/3): (1) Setup establishes David''s denial, his use of work as
    coping, the demolition notice, and introduces the core conflict. (2) Confrontation
    at midpoint: Sarah''s arrival and discovery of the Jesa shrine forces David to
    confront how he''s used his wife''s memory to avoid living and abandoned his daughter.
    The emotional climax (''She''s gone! And you used her to hide from me'') is powerful
    and specific. (3) Resolution: David makes the choice to let go of the restaurant,
    honor Miyoung differently, and rebuild with Sarah. The final image of wrapping
    the tablet and moving forward is thematically resonant.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is vivid and precise (''laser level humming like a dentist''s
    drill,'' ''fingers bird-boned but firm''). Pacing balances quiet moments with
    emotional peaks. Sensory details ground the story (the apron''s threadbare ties,
    the soju spreading across the floor). Dialogue reveals character and conflict
    naturally. The metaphor of fermentation (living culture, bacteria growing) ties
    thematic and literal elements together. Minor weakness: the developer scene, while
    functional, feels slightly rushed compared to the emotional depth elsewhere. The
    ending image is earned and moving without being saccharine.'
