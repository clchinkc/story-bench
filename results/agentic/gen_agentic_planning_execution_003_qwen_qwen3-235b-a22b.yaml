  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

  content: "**STORY PLAN: \"SOUP AND MEMORIES\"**\n\n---\n\n### **ACT 1: SETUP** \
    \ \n**Key Beats:**  \n1. **Opening Scene (Day 1):**  \n   - David, 50, methodically\
    \ prepares **kimchi jjigae** at dawn, the restaurant’s hearth his only solace.\
    \ Close-up of his weathered hands stirring—a mirror of his late wife’s. The camera\
    \ pans to a cracked demolition notice on the fridge.  \n   - **Regular Customer\
    \ Mr. Kim**, 78, arrives for his usual miso soup. Observes the notice: “Places\
    \ like this don’t grow back, David-ah.” David dismisses it.  \n   - **Symbolism\
    \ #1:** David buries a new jar of kimchi in the basement, a ritual he and his\
    \ wife began together. His hesitation before sealing it hints at unresolved grief.\
    \  \n\n2. **Inciting Incident:**  \n   - David’s daughter **Emily (30)** calls\
    \ from California. He avoids telling her about the demolition. Flashback: Emily\
    \ as a teen, angry at him for missing her recital during his wife’s final months.\
    \  \n   - **Estrangement Cause:** Emily resents his absence during her mother’s\
    \ illness; David guiltily recalls prioritizing the restaurant’s anniversary over\
    \ her graduation.  \n\n3. **Refusal of the Call:**  \n   - City officials pressure\
    \ David to sign papers. He refuses, claiming he’ll “fight.” Staff quietly pack\
    \ belongings. David discovers Emily’s childhood drawings taped behind the counter—his\
    \ wife saved them.  \n\n---\n\n### **ACT 2: CONFRONTATION**  \n**Key Beats:**\
    \  \n1. **Midpoint (Day 4):**  \n   - **Emily arrives unannounced.** They clash\
    \ in the kitchen:  \n     *Emily:* “You never left this kitchen, even when Mom\
    \ begged you to stay home.”  \n     *David:* “This place is all I have left of\
    \ her.”  \n   - David discovers Emily’s suitcase—she plans to fly back to CA that\
    \ night.  \n\n2. **Low Point:**  \n   - David drunkenly rummages the basement.\
    \ Finds his wife’s **recipe journal**, tucked inside a **bentook (Korean woven\
    \ basket)** she used for serving. Her note: “For the day you need to begin again.”\
    \  \n   - **Symbolism #2:** He cooks her **special bibimbap** recipe, burning\
    \ the rice—a first-time failure. Tears well up.  \n\n3. **Turning Point:**  \n\
    \   - Mr. Kim reveals he fled the Korean War with “only a pot and my mother’s\
    \ voice.” Hands David a jar of his own homemade kimchi: “Carry what matters.”\
    \  \n   - Emily finds the recipe journal. Shares memory: “Mom loved when you sang\
    \ *Arirang* while chopping scallions.” David tentatively hums the folk song, reconnecting\
    \ with Emily.  \n\n---\n\n### **ACT 3: RESOLUTION**  \n**Key Beats:**  \n1. **Climax\
    \ (Day 7):**  \n   - David declines the city’s final offer. Instead, he and Emily\
    \ draft a proposal to relocate the restaurant. Staff rejoice; Mr. Kim volunteers\
    \ to help move the kimchi jars.  \n   - **Korean Cultural Element:** They hold\
    \ a **“Jesa”** memorial for David’s wife in the empty dining room, offering her\
    \ favorite dishes. David whispers thanks, releasing her ashes into the kitchen’s\
    \ soil (where she once planted herbs).  \n\n2. **Denouement:**  \n   - Final day:\
    \ Father-daughter prep a moving feast. Emily teases David about burnt bibimbap;\
    \ he laughs—a sound she hasn’t heard in years.  \n   - **Last Image:** The demolition\
    \ crew arrives at dawn. David locks the door, hands Emily the bentook basket,\
    \ and walks to their new storefront across town, the jar of his wife’s kimchi\
    \ in his arms.  \n\n---\n\n### **CHARACTER ARCS**  \n- **David:** Denial → Confrontation\
    \ (Emily’s pain, his guilt) → Acceptance (legacy ≠ location).  \n- **Emily:**\
    \ Anger → Understanding (his love was silent, not absent) → Reconnection.  \n\
    - **Mr. Kim:** Embodies resilience; bridges David’s past/future.  \n\n### **KEY\
    \ DIALOGUE**  \n- Emily: “You kept her memory in a jar, Dad. She’s not there.”\
    \  \n- David (to Mr. Kim): “What if I don’t know how to cook for anyone but ghosts?”\
    \  \n- Wife’s journal entry: “The best meals feed the soul, even when the table’s\
    \ empty.”  \n\n### **TENSION CURVE**  \n- **Act 1:** Quiet dread (demolition notice)\
    \ → emotional volatility (Emily’s arrival).  \n- **Act 2:** Breaking point (failed\
    \ bibimbap) → catharsis (recipe note, Jesa ritual).  \n- **Act 3:** Bittersweet\
    \ hope (relocation) tempered by lingering loss (closed restaurant, ashes in soil).\
    \  \n\n### **CONSTRAINTS CHECK**  \n- Food: Kimchi (preservation/legacy), burned\
    \ bibimbap (imperfection/humanity).  \n- Grief: Shown through rituals, objects,\
    \ and omissions (e.g., untouched singing of *Arirang* until Act 3).  \n- Estrangement:\
    \ Specific, work-driven absence during Emily’s trauma.  \n- Cultural: Jesa ritual\
    \ and bentook basket.  \n- Ending: Hopeful (new restaurant, repaired bond), but\
    \ David glances back at the rubble.  \n\n--- \n\n**EXECUTION READY:** The plan\
    \ weaves grief, cultural identity, and familial bonds into a grounded, hopeful\
    \ arc. Symbolism and dialogue subtly underscore themes without over-explaining.\

    \ in his head for years. “You missed her final chemo session to fix the stove.\
