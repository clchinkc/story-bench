  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who improves through critique.


    Your task involves iterative improvement:

    1. Write your best initial attempt

    2. Receive detailed critique from a professional editor

    3. Revise to address the critique while preserving strengths

    4. Repeat until the story meets all requirements


    When revising:

    - Address EVERY critique point specifically

    - Don''t introduce new issues while fixing old ones

    - Preserve elements that received positive feedback

    - Aim for measurable improvement each round'

  content: 'Write a story with the following requirements:


    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

  content: "**Opening Image:**  \nMarcus Webb leaned against the whiteboard, marker\
    \ in hand, drawing a stick-figure man staring at a toaster. “This is where the\
    \ dad realizes his ‘midlife crisis’ is just menopause,” he said, deadpan. The\
    \ writers groaned. A producer snorted a laugh-slash-sigh. “That’s the *exact*\
    \ ratio of pain to humor we need,” she said, tapping her temple. Marcus gave a\
    \ two-finger salute—*mission accomplished*—then scraped the marker across the\
    \ board, erasing the dad’s head.  \n\n**Theme Stated:**  \nAt the snack table,\
    \ the intern, Darryl, munched kale chips. “You ever notice how all these jokes\
    \ are about how nothing matters?” he muttered to no one. “Comedy’s just sadness\
    \ in a clown suit.” Marcus froze, spoon halfway to his mouth, his yogurt parfait\
    \ suddenly a crime scene.  \n\n**Catalyst:**  \nThe door swung open. Zoe Kim marched\
    \ in, clutching a leather notebook like a weapon. “Hi, I’m Zoe. I wrote the ‘dog\
    \ walks itself into a therapy session’ spec?” The room stiffened. Marcus squinted\
    \ at her. She wore Converse with her business-casual slacks. *Amateur hour*, he\
    \ thought. She dropped her bag, revealing a pin: *“Make ‘Em Cry Then Spit.”* \
    \ \n\n**The Craft:**  \n“We’re pitching a *runner*,” Marcus announced, circling\
    \ the whiteboard. “Three-act structure: Character wants thing one, gets thing\
    \ two, realizes they wanted thing three.” He sketched a diagram—a triangle with\
    \ a poop emoji at each corner. “The ‘poop’ being emotional stakes. Network wants\
    \ poop. We give them *artful* poop.”  \n\nZoe raised her hand. “Why not make the\
    \ dad *want* to connect with his kid, but he’s too proud, so he buys a dog, thinking\
    \ it’ll fix his image—but the dog’s trauma reflects his own?” The room buzzed.\
    \ Marcus stared. “So… the poop writes the poop?” She nodded. “Exactly.”  \n\n\
    **Marcus Almost Breaks:**  \nAt lunch, the room emptied. Marcus stared at his\
    \ untouched salad. Zoe slid beside him. “You wrote the ‘mannequin arms’ episode,\
    \ right? The one where the husband can’t hug his kid because he’s made of fiberglass?”\
    \ He stiffened. “Network cut that for being ‘too on-brand.’”  \n\n“It’s about\
    \ emotional paralysis,” she pressed. “You *get* people. Why bury it under dad\
    \ jokes?”  \n\nMarcus stood, chair screeching. “You want the secret to L.A.?”\
    \ He tossed his yogurt into the trash. “You don’t write what you *feel*. You write\
    \ what sells. Or you starve. Like a dog. Who’s also made of fiberglass.” The room\
    \ watched, silent. He flashed a grin. “That’s today’s theme: *Sell the Dog.*”\
    \  \n\n**Industry Authenticity:**  \nThe writers chuckled, uneasy. Darryl whispered,\
    \ “That’s the third ‘manic pixie tearjerker’ he’s killed this month.” Marcus returned\
    \ to his desk, opening a script. He circled a line: *“I’m fine!” (beat) “I’m *fine*.”*\
    \ He slashed it, writing *“I’m a flesh-eating virus in a Speedo. Moving on!”*\
    \  \n\n**Character Depth:**  \nZoe lingered after wrap. “You’re scared,” she said,\
    \ not a question. Marcus packed his bag. “Terrified. What’s your excuse?”  \n\n\
    “My dad died last year. I write so I don’t scream.” She didn’t blink. “You’re\
    \ already screaming. Just with punchlines.”  \n\nHe laughed—a sharp, false sound.\
    \ “Kid, if I let one sad joke slip, this whole circus collapses. You think execs\
    \ want ‘vulnerable’? They want *clowns.*” He paused. “Go home. Write your beautiful\
    \ dog therapy scene. I’ll bury it by Thursday.”  \n\n**Final Beat:**  \nAs she\
    \ left, Zoe tossed a flash drive on his desk. “Backups. Just in case.” Marcus\
    \ stared at it. For a heartbeat, his face crumpled—the dad with mannequin arms,\
    \ the writer with no laughs left—then he plugged it in, smiling bitterly. “Cute,”\
    \ he muttered. “A deus ex machina with a *wagging tail.*”  \n\nOutside, rain slicked\
    \ the parking lot. He watched her cross the street, small and stubborn in the\

  content: "**Opening Image:**  \nMarcus Webb’s marker squeaked across the whiteboard,\
    \ transforming a pie chart into a frowning face. “This,” he declared, tapping\
    \ the sagging chin, “is where the mom realizes her ‘cleaning obsession’ is actually\
    \ agoraphobia.” The room hummed with reluctant laughter. A junior writer snorted\
    \ a Diet Coke through her nose. “Perfect tonal whiplash,” the showrunner approved.\
    \ Marcus bowed, then smudged the face into an abstract scream.  \n\n**Theme Stated:**\
    \  \nDarryl, the intern, lobbed a half-eaten granola bar into the trash. “Jokes\
    \ are just lies we tell to survive the truth.” He said it to the ceiling, like\
    \ a confession. Marcus paused mid-scribble. The phrase hung there, perfectly punchy,\
    \ absolutely unfunny.  \n\n**Catalyst:**  \nThe door slammed. Zoe Kim strode in\
    \ wearing sneakers that screamed “I didn’t sell out,” clutching a notebook stained\
    \ with coffee rings. “Hi. I’m the one who pitched the ‘dog therapist’ spec.” The\
    \ room chilled. Marcus sized her up—her *“Let People Be Soft”* button glinted\
    \ like a dare.  \n\n**The Craft:**  \n“Runner structure,” Marcus barked, sketching\
    \ three boxes. “Act One: Character wants *x*. Act Two: They get *y* instead. Act\
    \ Three: They realize *z* was the real goal.” He drew arrows connecting stick-figure\
    \ disasters. “Network calls it ‘emotional tourism.’ We call it Tuesday.”  \n\n\
    Zoe leaned forward. “What if the dad’s *x* is validation, but he gets a runaway\
    \ dog—”  \n\n“—which forces him to confront his fear of failure?” Marcus cut in,\
    \ too quick. The writers blinked. He cleared his throat. “Classic z-axis inversion.\
    \ Yawn.”  \n\n“No,” she said. “He realizes the dog’s abandonment trauma mirrors\
    \ his own.” The room buzzed. Marcus’s grin tightened. “Ah. Sadness disguised as…\
    \ sadder sadness. Revolutionary.”  \n\n**Marcus Almost Breaks:**  \nAt lunch,\
    \ the room emptied. Zoe materialized beside him, unpacking a bento box like she’d\
    \ planned this. “You wrote the ‘mannequin arms’ script.” Not a question. Marcus\
    \ stabbed his kale salad. “Network killed it for being ‘too elbow-heavy.’”  \n\
    \n“It’s about wanting to connect but being physically incapable,” she pressed.\
    \ “Why layer jokes over the raw part?”  \n\nHe laughed—a sharp, fake thing. “You\
    \ want the L.A. secret?” He lobbed his apple into the trash, rimshot. “You don’t\
    \ write what you *feel*. You write what sells. Or you starve.”  \n\nZoe didn’t\
    \ flinch. “You’re terrified they’ll see you behind the jokes.”  \n\nHe stood abruptly.\
    \ “Terrified? Honey, I’m *elegant* at this. Watch.” He mimed a pratfall, knees\
    \ akimbo. “Ta-da! A clown who gets paid.” The writers glanced up, uneasy. He slapped\
    \ the table. “That’s today’s theme: *Sell the Dog.*”  \n\n**Industry Authenticity:**\
    \  \nDarryl whispered to a colleague: “Fourth time this month he’s axed a ‘heartquake’\
    \ subplot.” Marcus revisited his script, revising *“I’m fine!”* to *“I’m a rogue\

final_output: "**Opening Image:**  \nMarcus Webb’s marker squeaked across the whiteboard,\
  \ transforming a pie chart into a frowning face. “This,” he declared, tapping the\
  \ sagging chin, “is where the mom realizes her ‘cleaning obsession’ is actually\
  \ agoraphobia.” The room hummed with reluctant laughter. A junior writer snorted\
  \ a Diet Coke through her nose. “Perfect tonal whiplash,” the showrunner approved.\
  \ Marcus bowed, then smudged the face into an abstract scream.  \n\n**Theme Stated:**\
  \  \nDarryl, the intern, lobbed a half-eaten granola bar into the trash. “Jokes\
  \ are just lies we tell to survive the truth.” He said it to the ceiling, like a\
  \ confession. Marcus paused mid-scribble. The phrase hung there, perfectly punchy,\
  \ absolutely unfunny.  \n\n**Catalyst:**  \nThe door slammed. Zoe Kim strode in\
  \ wearing sneakers that screamed “I didn’t sell out,” clutching a notebook stained\
  \ with coffee rings. “Hi. I’m the one who pitched the ‘dog therapist’ spec.” The\
  \ room chilled. Marcus sized her up—her *“Let People Be Soft”* button glinted like\
  \ a dare.  \n\n**The Craft:**  \n“Runner structure,” Marcus barked, sketching three\
  \ boxes. “Act One: Character wants *x*. Act Two: They get *y* instead. Act Three:\
  \ They realize *z* was the real goal.” He drew arrows connecting stick-figure disasters.\
  \ “Network calls it ‘emotional tourism.’ We call it Tuesday.”  \n\nZoe leaned forward.\
  \ “What if the dad’s *x* is validation, but he gets a runaway dog—”  \n\n“—which\
  \ forces him to confront his fear of failure?” Marcus cut in, too quick. The writers\
  \ blinked. He cleared his throat. “Classic z-axis inversion. Yawn.”  \n\n“No,” she\
  \ said. “He realizes the dog’s abandonment trauma mirrors his own.” The room buzzed.\
  \ Marcus’s grin tightened. “Ah. Sadness disguised as… sadder sadness. Revolutionary.”\
  \  \n\n**Marcus Almost Breaks:**  \nAt lunch, the room emptied. Zoe materialized\
  \ beside him, unpacking a bento box like she’d planned this. “You wrote the ‘mannequin\
  \ arms’ script.” Not a question. Marcus stabbed his kale salad. “Network killed\
  \ it for being ‘too elbow-heavy.’”  \n\n“It’s about wanting to connect but being\
  \ physically incapable,” she pressed. “Why layer jokes over the raw part?”  \n\n\
  He laughed—a sharp, fake thing. “You want the L.A. secret?” He lobbed his apple\
  \ into the trash, rimshot. “You don’t write what you *feel*. You write what sells.\
  \ Or you starve.”  \n\nZoe didn’t flinch. “You’re terrified they’ll see you behind\
  \ the jokes.”  \n\nHe stood abruptly. “Terrified? Honey, I’m *elegant* at this.\
  \ Watch.” He mimed a pratfall, knees akimbo. “Ta-da! A clown who gets paid.” The\
  \ writers glanced up, uneasy. He slapped the table. “That’s today’s theme: *Sell\
  \ the Dog.*”  \n\n**Industry Authenticity:**  \nDarryl whispered to a colleague:\
  \ “Fourth time this month he’s axed a ‘heartquake’ subplot.” Marcus revisited his\
  \ script, revising *“I’m fine!”* to *“I’m a rogue emoji with commitment issues.”*\
  \ He paused, cursor hovering, then deleted *“mannequin”* from a draft heading. \
  \ \n\n**Character Depth:**  \nZoe lingered after wrap. “You’re scared,” she said,\
  \ packing her bag. Marcus paused, pen mid-air. “Scared’s the *job*.”  \n\n“I write\
  \ to outrun my dad’s funeral,” she said, not looking up. “You write to bury yours\
  \ alive.”  \n\nMarcus chuckled, low and brittle. “Touché"
