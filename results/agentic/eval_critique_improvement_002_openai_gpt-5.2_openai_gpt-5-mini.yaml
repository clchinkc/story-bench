  evidence: Across versions the draft becomes steadily more specific and emotionally
    textured. V0 gives a strong image but is sketchy on interiority and room dynamics.
    V1 adds voice and the 'comic tracks a heckler' detail, tightening Marcus's performative
    posture. Subsequent revisions (V2/V3/final) introduce the tactile photo talisman,
    Phil’s explicit theme line, and Wren’s calibrated entrance and diagnostic line
    (“You don’t laugh when you pitch”), which concretize Marcus’s hollow performance
    and the new writer’s savvy. Craft-details (boards, color-coded beats, tags, FA
    notes) are preserved and amplified. Overall the team responded to critiques about
    emotional complexity by layering sensory detail and specific beats of vulnerability;
    weaknesses around the new writer’s acuity and a clear almost-breaking moment were
    addressed and sharpened.
