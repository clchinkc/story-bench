  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is well-structured with detailed beat-by-beat outline.
    Output demonstrates strong atmospheric writing and psychological depth. Successfully
    executes: (1) False lead with Gregory Voss/spiral symbol misdirection, (2) Unconventional
    profiling via sensory immersion in victims'' spaces (turpentine, lavender, sketchbooks),
    (3) Ticking clock (7-day cycle, ''third victim alive''), (4) Midpoint confrontation
    between Marcus and Harrington (non-physical, dialogue-driven revelation about
    Daniel''s complicity). GAPS: (1) Secondary character betrayal is present (Vasquez)
    but underdeveloped—feels rushed and lacks emotional weight; her motivations unclear.
    (2) ''Debate'' beat missing entirely—no scene where Marcus argues against pursuing
    the case or questions his approach. (3) ''Break into Two'' beat absent—no clear
    turning point where Marcus commits to a new strategy after learning Daniel''s
    involvement. (4) Past failure confrontation exists thematically but lacks explicit
    acknowledgment; Marcus never directly states what he failed at with Daniel. OUTPUT
    ISSUES: Ending feels abrupt and somewhat contradictory (rain stops, then ''wept''—unclear
    metaphorically). Harrington''s motivation as ''music professor'' connected to
    Daniel feels underdeveloped; their relationship needs more setup. Naomi''s role
    expands significantly in execution beyond plan, creating some narrative imbalance.
    PACING: Strong in first two-thirds; final act compresses resolution too quickly.'
