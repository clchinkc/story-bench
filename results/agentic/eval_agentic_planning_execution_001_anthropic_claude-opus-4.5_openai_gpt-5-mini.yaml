  evidence: 'All six constraints are present: false lead (Thomas Brennan), unconventional
    technique (Spatial Empathy Mapping), ticking clock (origami cranes/Seven days
    and explicit countdowns), secondary betrayal (Lena publishes the podcast exposing
    Marcus), midpoint direct confrontation (verbal exchange with Dr. Alan Whitmore
    in the lecture hall), and Marcus explicitly confronting his past failure (dialogue
    about Sarah''s death and Whitmore''s accusation). Required beats appear and are
    executed: Catalyst (arrival of origami crane/package), Debate (Diana''s rejection
    and Lena/Ray exchanges), Break into Two (Marcus returns to mapping and pursues
    Brennan, breaks into his apartment), Midpoint (verbal confrontation with Whitmore).
    The plan is detailed and the final output follows it closely; narrative pacing,
    stakes, and tension are handled well, with only minor room to deepen emotional
    beats.'
