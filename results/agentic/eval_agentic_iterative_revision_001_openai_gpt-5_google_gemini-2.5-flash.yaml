  evidence: The initial versions were very similar, focusing only on Elena's competence.
    The later versions (not provided in full, but implied by the final output) clearly
    introduced the flaw, the friendship, and the internal transformation. The final
    output successfully integrates all these elements, showing a significant improvement
    in narrative depth and constraint adherence compared to the initial snippets.
    The medical detail and ambiguity are also well-integrated. The only constraint
    not fully met is the 'genuine and earned' friendship, which feels a bit rushed
    in its development, though the elements are present.
error: null
