    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. PLANNING PHASE: Create a detailed story plan/outline

    2. EXECUTION PHASE: Write the actual story following your plan


    In the PLANNING phase, output a structured plan including:

    - Beat-by-beat outline with key events

    - Character arcs and development points

    - Key dialogue moments or revelations

    - Pacing and tension curve

    - How constraints will be satisfied


    In the EXECUTION phase, follow your plan closely while writing engaging prose.'

  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Save the Cat

    - Protagonist: Marcus Chen, a former FBI profiler who left the bureau after failing
    to

    catch a serial killer who murdered his partner. Now works as a private

    consultant, haunted by guilt and self-doubt.


    - Setting: Seattle, present day. Rain-soaked streets, a city of tech money and

    hidden poverty. The killer is back, and only Marcus can see the pattern.


    - Conflict: The same serial killer Marcus failed to catch has resurfaced with
    a new

    pattern, and the FBI won''t listen to Marcus''s theories. He must work

    outside the system while racing against time.


    - Required beats: Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must include a false lead that Marcus initially pursues

    - Marcus must use an unconventional profiling technique

    - There must be a ticking clock element

    - A secondary character must betray Marcus''s trust

    - The Midpoint must involve a direct confrontation (not physical)

    - Marcus must confront his past failure explicitly


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

  content: 'Seattle wears the rain like a confession. It slicks the alleys and polishes
    the tech towers, softens the tents under the viaduct and the neon reflections
    in puddles. Marcus Chen stands under the wet hiss of it, watching a trolley clatter
    past and thinking about Elise’s laugh, the way she used to tell him to stop living
    in his head and look up.


    He looks up. Blue strobes feather through mist, pooling around a stretch of caution
    tape. Another body, another note. He doesn’t cross the tape; he isn’t Bureau anymore.
    He knows the rhythm of the killer’s staging without seeing the rest. The victim
    is positioned near a ventilation grate. There will be a paper program from some
    concert years ago, damp and useless, tucked in a pocket. The angle of the jaw—chin
    tilted, like a conductor cueing the brass. The killer always leaves people turned
    toward a sound.


    Marcus turns away, phone buzzing. Aria Park’s name pops up—a data journalist with
    a knack for getting herself invited where she doesn’t belong.


    “You’re there,” she says. “I can hear the radios.”


    “I’m on the sidewalk,” he corrects. “Like a good civilian.”


    “And? Same guy?”


    “They won’t say so,” he says. “But yes.”


    “Then you’re going to do something,” she says. It’s not a question. Aria had helped
    him scrape old badge-swipe data last year when he still thought the pattern lived
    inside spreadsheets.


    Marcus stares at the grate flashing with water. “He’s back.”


    Catalyst. A fancy word for the moment your heart starts to run.


    He tries Agent Dana Ruiz first, because he thinks maybe there’s a bridge that
    hasn’t burned. She answers on the second ring; he can hear the task force buzz
    behind her.


    “Dana—”


    “Not now, Marcus.”


    “He’s using the vents again,” he says quickly. “It’s an acoustic signature. D-sharp.
    The old cases lined up with air columns that sang that note when rain got into
    them just so. This is a wet winter. You’re going to see more.”


    She sighs. “We’re not talking about your—what did you call it—sound mapping?”


    “Soundprint. Architecture plus weather,” he says. “It’s not a theory. It’s pattern.”


    “Last time your pattern got your partner killed,” she says, and the click at the
    end is soft but meaner than a slam.


    He breathes with the rain. Elise’s body on the factory floor, the smell of machine
    oil and wet wood; the reflection in her pupils when he was one step too late and
    the killer was already gone.


    Debate. He wants to go home. He wants to pour out the coffee barely cooled on
    his counter, erase the string from his walls, forget the ghost that walks him
    through Seattle at night.


    Instead, he goes back to his apartment, tacks a fresh city map above his desk.
    He boots up a program he wrote with Aria’s help—an overlay of wind patterns, rainfall
    microbursts, urban canyon acoustics, and topographic quirks. He adds a layer of
    transit noises recorded from traffic cams, digitized into spectrograms. The city
    hums in grayscale.


    Aria arrives with a bag of grocery-store sushi and the electric hum of someone
    who lives on the verge of the next scoop. “You’re really doing the sound thing.”


    “It’s the only thing that’s new,” he says. “Everything else—the trophies, the
    staging—is theater. He’s composing. He wants his murders to be heard. The vents
    he picks sing at the same frequency when the rain hits right. He moves when the
    storms move.”


    “That’s… weird.”


    “It’s true.”


    They work while rain slips down the glass. He drags police blotters onto the map,
    old cases and the fresh one, overlays weather data from the past week. A rough
    corridor emerges, not where wealth lives, but the seam where it rubs against the
    poor. Where the rain resonates quick and sharp off cheap sheet metal and the air
    shafts from new tech campuses.


    Ticking clock. On the scanner, a voice—tinny, wallowing in static—breaks every
    thought. “Midnight,” the voice says. “You never learned to listen, Marcus.”


    Marcus freezes. Aria’s mouth forms a silent no. The voice isn’t on any frequency
    he recognizes; it’s patched across several, a trick of hacked repeaters.


    “Who is this?” Marcus asks out loud before he knows he’s speaking.


    “You left me a gift once,” the voice says. “An empty room with a view of the end.
    Four nights, four choirs in the rain. We’re only on the second hymn.”


    The line dies. Aria stares at him. “He knows your name.”


    “He always did,” Marcus says, throat raw. “Midnight.”


    Break into Two. You go or you don’t. He goes.


    They narrow the map to three blocks—places where HVAC shafts sing D-sharp when
    saturated. One location stands out: a biotech campus with a maintenance supervisor
    who moves between buildings at odd hours. His name is Evan Cole, a seventy-percent
    overlap with badge swipes near old crime scenes back when Cole worked for another
    company. It’s a neat stack. Too neat.


    Marcus and Aria run through rain toward the campus. Security makes them wait until
    Dana’s agents arrive; apparently, being annoying pays off, because she shows up
    fast with two SUVs and an attitude that says I hate being here as much as I hate
    that you’re here.


    “You brought me a suspect,” she says.


    “I brought you a probability,” Marcus says. “We have hours.”


    They find Cole in the garage, pushing a cart of filters. He flinches at the flash
    of badges, trips over a coil of hose, and a box cutter skitters. Dana’s guys pin
    him against a support pillar and make a lot of noise about rights. Cole’s eyes
    are blown wide. “I clean vents,” he stammers. “That’s my job.”


    False lead. Aria’s camera catches an angle that reads guilt even if it’s only
    fear. Dana smiles like she’s going to be allowed to sleep tonight.


    Marcus watches Cole’s hands. They’re trembling. The cuts on his knuckles are old.
    The man is a maintenance worker with nicotine stains and a bad back. If this were
    Elise’s case board, he would circle Cole in pencil, not ink.


    Midpoint. The killer calls again. Not a phone, but the building’s emergency PA.
    The garage fills with a voice like a hymn sung through a fan blade.


    “You arrested a janitor,” it says. “Marcus, Marcus. You used to be better at this
    game.”


    Dana’s head snaps up. She looks at Marcus as if he summoned the devil. Marcus
    steps toward the nearest speaker.


    “What do you want?” he says.


    “To see if you can finally do what you couldn’t for Elise,” the voice says, lazy
    with pleasure. “You left her breathing long enough to watch you fail. Midnight,
    Marcus. The third hymn wavers. Listen for the choir.”


    Everyone is quiet enough to hear the rain bead on the hood of the nearest car.
    Marcus swallows. “I left her in that factory because I thought you would stay
    for me,” he says into the speaker, a confession wrenched free. “I gambled her
    life on my pattern and I lost. I will not lose again.”


    “Then hurry,” the voice says, sweet as wet rust. “The choir’s soprano tires easily.”


    The PA clicks off. Dana rounds on him. “How long have you been talking to him?”
    she says.


    “Since ten minutes ago,” Marcus says. “He’s moving with the storms. His riddle—choirs—he’s
    not talking about literal choirs. He’s talking about places that sing when it
    rains.”


    Aria is already typing. Her fingers skitter, and he sees the email subject pop
    up on her screen like a flare: Killer’s acoustic map. Exclusive. His chest hollows.
    “Aria.”


    She doesn’t look up. “People need to know where not to go. If public pressure
    forces the Bureau to act, maybe—”


    “You just handed him my ears,” Marcus says. “He’s watching the same feeds you
    are.”
