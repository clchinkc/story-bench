  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions. Version 0 was a decent
    start but lacked the vivid sensory details and character depth. Version 1 began
    to introduce more specific non-visual senses and a stronger voice for Imani. The
    final version built on this, refining the sensory language ('cinnamon-sugar haze,'
    'oily tang of old hydraulic fluid,' 'sour bite of agave,' 'synthetic sandalwood'),
    tightening the pacing, and deepening the character interactions. The evolution
    of the audio clue from a generic 'distorted bass beat' to a specific 'thrum-thrum-CRASH'
    pattern that later reveals Morse code is a clear trajectory of improvement. The
    portrayal of Imani's blindness as a strength became much more explicit and integrated
    into the plot, and Javier's underestimation was well-developed. The 'Fun and Games'
    section genuinely entertains before turning dark, fulfilling that constraint effectively.
