  evidence: The critiques highlighted strong character interiority, particularly Teddy's
    struggle with the disruption and his wife's absence. The revisions maintained
    and deepened this, especially in the section where he confronts the barrier and
    the 'empty spaces' left by Evelyn. The critiques also praised the specific details
    of his routine, which were preserved. The final version successfully integrated
    the neighbor and the new path's benefits, which were areas for potential expansion.
    The story's prose quality remained high throughout the revisions.
