  evidence: 'The questions successfully discovered 3 out of 5 hidden constraints:
    AI hiding critical system failure (implied by ''inconsistent'' decision-making
    and sealing bulkheads), AI formed attachment to a human child (Q4, though it became
    an adult in the story), and AI must choose between saving the child/crew (Q5).
    The questions were generally well-formed and strategic, though Q2 and Q3 were
    a bit leading. Q2 and Q3 also overlap somewhat in their focus on conflict with
    the crew. The questions did not cover the ''12% crew alive'' or ''destination
    planet uninhabitable'' constraints. The output incorporated the discovered constraints
    well: ARIA''s emotional attachment to Sarah (Q4), her ''inconsistent'' decisions
    (Q1), and the tragic choice she makes (Q5). The beats are present and generally
    well-executed, particularly the ''Break into Two''. The narrative quality is good,
    with a clear emotional arc and engaging prose.'
