  evidence: 'Strengths: Yuki''s isolation is convincingly shown through behavior (earpieces,
    avoiding social moments, auto-archiving family messages), a colleague (Amara)
    challenges her approach, the mentor is an unconventional AI (Hermes), and there
    is a clear, surprising human connection when Amara brings tea and admits vulnerability.
    Call to Adventure and Refusal are explicit. Weaknesses: the alien signal is occasionally
    anthropomorphized (Hermes calls it ''conversation'' and later narrative analogies),
    which undermines the requirement that it feel genuinely alien; the Crossing the
    Threshold is portrayed primarily as a physical journey (shuttle/Antarctica) rather
    than being framed as a psychological threshold as required. Consequently Crossing
    the Threshold is not executed in the requested psychological manner.'
