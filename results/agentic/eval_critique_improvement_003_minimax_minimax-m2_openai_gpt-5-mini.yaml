  evidence: 'Across revisions the story tightened and the child voice was emphasized
    more deliberately: Version 0 established the premise but used some adult-leaning
    diction and exposition. Version 1 introduced stronger sensory lines and colloquial
    beats ("tools work if you kick them gently", "spray tastes like salt and pennies"),
    reducing exposition. Subsequent edits (Versions 2–3/Final) preserved those youthful
    moments, sharpened the storm sequence, and made the danger feel immediate (debris
    strike, near-capsize, cold surge). Critiques repeatedly flagged remaining adulty
    phrasing (e.g., "pre-flood archive", "Environmental") which the author reduced
    but did not entirely eliminate, so responsiveness is solid but not complete. Strengths—Zara''s
    ingenuity (wind-scoop), a clearly flawed mentor, and real peril during the crossing—were
    preserved and highlighted; worldbuilding became more vivid and concrete, and the
    ending balances pragmatic hope without sentimentality.'
