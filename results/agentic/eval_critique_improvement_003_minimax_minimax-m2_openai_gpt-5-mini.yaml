  evidence: 'Version progression shows clear, targeted improvements. V0 established
    setting but was broader and less specific. By V2/V3 the story adds a concrete
    invention (wind‑powered water still), a named adult who dismisses Zara (Mr. Alvarez:
    “Kid…”), and a clearly flawed mentor (Tomas: ex‑engineer, alcoholic, lost job
    and wife). The crossing sequence is expanded from implied risk to visceral danger:
    storm surge, groaning/tipping platforms, jumping between bobbing slabs, salt spray
    blinding Zara, and use of a jury‑rigged portable air pump — all raising stakes.
    Voice remains first‑person, terse, and age‑appropriate across revisions (kept
    lines like “I’m twelve. I know what I want.”). Overall the edits preserved the
    story’s strengths (voice, setting) while adding the missing concrete elements
    and escalating the peril, satisfying the listed constraints. Minor gaps: the Hero’s
    Journey arc is present in outline (call to adventure, reluctant/tense acceptance,
    flawed mentor, threshold/crossing) but the later beats (ordeal resolution and
    clear transformative return) are only hinted at in this excerpt.'
