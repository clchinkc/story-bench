  evidence: 'PLAN STRENGTHS: Comprehensive Save the Cat framework with clear thematic
    intent (''redemption through action, not insight''). Specific details: environmental
    empathy mapping technique, 72-hour countdown, microchip under tongue, Seattle
    setting, Elena as ally, Dana as murdered partner. Strong seeding of all major
    elements. CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS: (1) FALSE LEAD—Evan Lorne appears guilty but plan
    suggests he may not be (satisfies); (2) UNCONVENTIONAL PROFILING—Environmental
    empathy mapping fully detailed and used (satisfies); (3) TICKING CLOCK—72-hour
    countdown with time-lock encryption (satisfies); (4) SECONDARY BETRAYAL—Elena
    betrays Marcus to Whitaker (satisfies); (5) MIDPOINT CONFRONTATION—Lorne confrontation
    is verbal/psychological, not physical (satisfies); (6) CONFRONT PAST FAILURE—Plan
    states Marcus ''explicitly'' confronts Dana''s death, but OUTPUT shows only internal
    acknowledgment (''I failed you'') before action, not a full dramatic confrontation
    scene (PARTIALLY SATISFIES). BEAT EXECUTION: (1) CATALYST—Body discovery + Elena''s
    warning (strong); (2) DEBATE—Elena''s ''patterns don''t save people'' dialogue
    (clear); (3) BREAK INTO TWO—Whitaker dismissal + Marta''s chip data (present but
    subtle); (4) MIDPOINT—Lorne confrontation (executed but lacks the dramatic weight
    of a true turning point; feels more like Act 1 climax). OUTPUT QUALITY: Prose
    is atmospheric and psychologically rich. Pacing accelerates effectively. Sensory
    details (rain, neon, wet asphalt) create immersion. Character voice is distinct.
    However, the Lorne scene, while tense, doesn''t fully function as a midpoint reversal—it''s
    more of a false-lead confirmation. The final betrayal by Elena lands emotionally
    but arrives late. The 47-hour countdown reset feels slightly arbitrary. ADHERENCE:
    Output follows plan closely but compresses timeline and doesn''t fully develop
    the midpoint confrontation''s emotional/thematic stakes as outlined.'
error: null
