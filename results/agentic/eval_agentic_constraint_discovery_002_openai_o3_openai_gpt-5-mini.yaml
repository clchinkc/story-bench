  evidence: Only one hidden constraint was uncovered (a required additional specific
    character who is human). The five questions asked focused on length, viewpoint/tense,
    presence of an extra character, whether that character is human, and avoidance
    of violence—these missed the critical operational and moral constraints (hidden
    system failure, crew casualty rate, planet uninhabitability, AI attachment to
    a child, and a choice between saving the child or crew). The discovered constraint
    (human character) is incorporated (Mira). The story executes the listed beats
    cleanly and is stylistically strong, but it fails to surface or integrate the
    majority of the hidden constraints.
