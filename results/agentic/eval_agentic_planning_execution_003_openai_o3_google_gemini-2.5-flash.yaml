  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing all constraints
    and beats with concrete events. The final output adheres very closely to the plan,
    with only minor deviations (e.g., the specific timing of the B story and some
    minor reordering of events within acts). All constraints are met: food is symbolic
    twice (cold barley tea, buried jangajji), David''s grief is shown through his
    actions and internal state without explicit mention, the daughter''s estrangement
    cause is clear and believable (refusal to eulogize), Mr. Alvarez represents memory/tradition,
    the ending is hopeful but not unrealistically happy (stay, not victory), and Korean
    cultural elements are present (barley tea, kimchi jjigae, jangajji, han/jeong,
    haejangguk). All three beats (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution) are clearly executed.
    The narrative quality is strong, with good pacing, tension, and evocative language.'
