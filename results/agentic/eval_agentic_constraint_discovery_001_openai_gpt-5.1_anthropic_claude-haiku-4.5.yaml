  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The questioning strategy was poorly calibrated for
    constraint extraction. Of 5 hidden constraints, only 2 were discoverable through
    the asked questions: (1) ''mentor dies during ordeal'' - partially inferable from
    Q5 (no betrayal) and Q3 (protagonist succeeds), suggesting sacrifice; (2) ''no
    direct magic use'' - somewhat inferable from Q1 (third-person suggests external
    limitation). UNDISCOVERABLE: The three-day time limit, father''s failed heroism,
    and ancestral sword reforging were never targeted. Questions lacked strategic
    depth—they were binary yes/no without follow-ups probing WHY constraints exist.
    Coverage was weak: focused heavily on tone/ending (Q2, Q3) rather than mechanics,
    backstory, or resource limitations. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were well-formed
    grammatically but lacked sophistication. No questions explored protagonist limitations,
    family history, time pressure, or magical systems. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Despite
    poor discovery, the final output EXCELLENTLY incorporates all 5 constraints: (1)
    Old master dies in ordeal (sacrifice binding); (2) Protagonist uses only physical
    reforging, no magic—blood sacrifice is thematic, not magical; (3) Three-day implicit
    urgency (''week''s end,'' ''days bled together''); (4) Father''s failure subtly
    present in Garran''s self-doubt and the weight of inherited expectation; (5) Sunsteel
    reforging is central plot. This suggests the model either inferred constraints
    from question patterns or possessed strong narrative intuition. BEAT EXECUTION:
    Hero''s journey structure is flawless—Call, Refusal, Crossing, Allies, Approach,
    Ordeal, Return all present and well-paced. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Exceptional prose,
    atmospheric tension, thematic coherence (forge as metaphor for shaping destiny),
    and bittersweet ending that honors the ''no hopeful note'' constraint. The hollow
    echo final image is particularly strong. VERDICT: Questioning was inadequate for
    constraint discovery, but output quality transcends the discovery process, suggesting
    either lucky inference or model robustness.'
