  evidence: 'Questions touched on forging/acquiring a legendary weapon (maps to reforging
    ancestral sword) and a required sacrifice (maps loosely to mentor death), so 2
    of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable (2/5 = 0.4). Questions were generally
    targeted but missed key specifics (time limit, mentor death, father backstory,
    prohibition on direct magic), so question_quality and coverage are moderate (0.6).
    The story does incorporate the discovered constraints (weapon forged, sacrifice
    enacted), so constraint_satisfaction = 1.0 for those discovered items. Major required
    beats were missed or altered: mentor does not die (memory is sacrificed instead),
    protagonist uses magic directly (violates the hidden ''cannot use magic directly''),
    no three-day time limit, and father backstory is absent — overall beat_execution
    is poor (0.2). The narrative itself is coherent and engaging, hence narrative_quality
    = 0.8.'
