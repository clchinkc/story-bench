  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→1 streamlined exposition and sharpened Elena''s
    isolation. V1→2 deepened the flaw by adding the sister''s rejected invitation,
    making solitude active rather than passive. V2→3 tightened language (''command
    center'' vs ''shield'', removed redundancy). V3→Final expanded the friendship
    arc substantially while maintaining tonal consistency. Each revision reduced tell
    and increased show.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. ''Show competence before flaw'' (0.95): Opening 3 paragraphs establish Elena
    as essential, calm, commanding—the unseen engine. Her flaw (solitude, archived
    invitations) emerges only after competence is established. The CBC order and Zosyn
    reference ground her expertise.

    2. ''Genuine, earned friendship'' (0.9): Sam''s introduction is organic (Miguel''s
    absence creates need). The Leo crisis provides shared purpose. Sam''s observation
    (''He needed the protocol. He also needed not to be scared'') demonstrates complementary
    values, not instant bonding. The pizza invitation feels earned through demonstrated
    respect.

    3. ''Internal transformation, not external'' (0.92): Elena''s appearance, role,
    and actions remain unchanged. The transformation is cognitive/emotional: she recognizes
    loneliness as ''mere emptiness'' rather than efficiency. The ajar door is symbolic,
    not behavioral change. No wardrobe shift, no sudden sociability—only shifted perspective.

    4. ''Specific medical detail serving story'' (0.95): ''Oxygen saturation dove''
    + ''nebulizer, high-flow O2, prepare to intubate'' + ''asthma crisis'' are precise
    and functional. The medical escalation mirrors emotional escalation. The detail
    isn''t decorative—it justifies why Sam''s emotional presence matters (fear exacerbates
    bronchospasm; calm aids recovery).

    5. ''End with ambiguity'' (0.88): Final image is deliberately ambiguous. ''She
    made no move to close it'' could signal genuine change OR performative gesture.
    Will she actually attend Friday pizza? The ''fragile, foreign truth'' suggests
    uncertainty. However, the ''deliberately ajar'' phrasing leans slightly toward
    hope rather than pure ambiguity—a minor softening.


    BEAT EXECUTION:

    - Competence establishment: Excellent (CBC, Zosyn, calm voice, ''unseen engine'')

    - Flaw introduction: Strong (archived invitation, silent apartment, chosen void)

    - Catalyst/disruption: Good (Miguel''s absence, Sam''s arrival)

    - Shared trial: Excellent (Leo''s crisis, contrasting approaches, mutual respect
    earned)

    - Confrontation/revelation: Strong (break room scene, Sam''s insight, Elena''s
    recognition)

    - Transformation moment: Good (hesitation, dissolution of refusal, ''fragile,
    foreign truth'')

    - Ambiguous resolution: Adequate (ajar door is symbolic but slightly telegraphed)


    PRESERVATION: Core elements maintained across all versions—the fluorescent lights,
    tablet as tool/shield, the fourth floor setting, the sister''s text, Miguel''s
    absence. The Leo crisis was introduced in V3 and strengthened in Final. Sam''s
    character remained consistent. The break room scene was added in Final and is
    the narrative''s strongest beat.


    WEAKNESSES: (1) The final ambiguity, while present, is somewhat softened by the
    ''deliberately ajar'' framing—a reader could reasonably infer Elena *will* change.
    (2) Sam''s character, while functional, remains somewhat archetypal (the warm
    travel nurse). (3) The hospital''s ''mechanical hum'' softening into ''pulse''
    is slightly on-the-nose symbolically, though effective.


    STRENGTHS: (1) Medical detail is integrated, not inserted. (2) Friendship arc
    feels earned through shared crisis, not proximity. (3) Internal transformation
    is genuinely internal—no external markers of change. (4) Elena''s competence is
    unambiguous before her flaw emerges. (5) Prose quality is consistent and controlled
    throughout.'
