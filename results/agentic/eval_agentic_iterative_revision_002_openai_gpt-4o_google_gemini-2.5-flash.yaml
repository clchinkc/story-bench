  evidence: The initial versions were very similar, focusing only on the opening paragraph.
    The final version successfully expanded the narrative to address most constraints.
    The 'Fun and Games' aspect was present but didn't feel genuinely entertaining
    before turning dark; it was more a description of the podcast's function. The
    other constraints were well-addressed. The non-visual sensory details were prominent,
    Imani's blindness was portrayed respectfully and as a strength, the audio clue
    was crucial, and Detective Carter initially underestimated her.
