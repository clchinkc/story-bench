  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 2 were discoverable
    through the questions asked: (1) Personal connection threatened (Q1: YES - Liora)
    and (2) Unexpected magical heritage (Q3: YES - Emberborn revelation). The critical
    constraints were missed: Mentor death (not probed), three-day time limit (not
    probed), ancestral sword reforging (not probed), and protagonist cannot use magic
    directly (contradicted by Q3 answer). QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were reasonably
    well-formed but lacked strategic depth. Q2 about sentient darkness was answered
    NO, yet the story features sentient Blight behavior. Q4 about sacrifice was YES
    but didn''t probe the specific nature (mentor vs. protagonist). Q5 about rival
    allies was NO, limiting exploration of relationship dynamics. COVERAGE: Questions
    touched character relationships, magical elements, sacrifice, and alliances, but
    missed temporal constraints, ancestral/heritage specifics, and mentor dynamics.
    OUTPUT EVALUATION: CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.4): Story incorporates personal
    connection (Liora) and magical heritage discovery well. However: (1) Mentor Harkin
    does NOT die—he''s absent from the climax entirely, violating a core constraint.
    (2) No three-day countdown is established or referenced. (3) The ''Heartforge''
    is reforged/completed but framed as ancestral only vaguely. (4) Protagonist DOES
    use magic directly (palm fire, blood magic), contradicting the constraint. (5)
    No rival ally appears. BEAT EXECUTION (0.5): The ordeal is present and emotionally
    resonant (hand sacrifice), but lacks the mentor''s death beat entirely. The sacrifice
    is protagonist-focused rather than mentor-focused. The time pressure is absent,
    reducing urgency. NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.8): The story is well-written with strong
    prose, clear character voice, emotional stakes, and a compelling arc. Liora''s
    revelation, the Blight''s manifestation, and Elias''s transformation are engaging.
    The ending is poignant and leaves room for continuation. However, structural gaps
    from missed constraints weaken thematic coherence.'
