  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer addressed interiority feedback inconsistently.
    Critiques 1-3 flagged that Teddy''s inner life needed deeper specificity and less
    exposition. The final output shows modest improvement—phrases like ''a restlessness,
    sharp as a splinter, worked its way under his skin'' and ''a familiar impulse
    to help warring with a deeper urge to remain unseen'' demonstrate internalized
    conflict. However, some moments still rely on telling (''The barrier felt like
    a lock on a door he''d kept closed'') rather than pure action/sensation. The writer
    preserved strong sensory anchors but didn''t fully eliminate abstract emotional
    labeling that critiques identified.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Versions 1-3 appear nearly identical in the provided text,
    suggesting limited revision iteration. The final output does show refinement from
    Version 0 (which is truncated), particularly in deepening the Aliyah encounter
    and the bowl''s symbolic weight. The trajectory is modest rather than dramatic—incremental
    strengthening of existing strengths rather than structural overhaul.


    PRESERVATION: Excellent. The opening''s sensory precision (''three sidewalk cracks...memorized
    like a line in a favorite song'') remains intact. The liturgical language (''quiet,
    predictable liturgy'') that critiques praised is preserved. The Eleanor absence
    is maintained as haunting presence. Aliyah''s introduction and the neighbor intersection
    remain strong.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5): (1) Teddy''s routine shown with loving detail—YES:
    ''three sidewalk cracks,'' ''scent of Mr. Henderson''s lilacs,'' ''rattle of Mrs.
    Finley''s upstairs window,'' ''soft, crumbling edge of the curb.'' (2) Disruption
    reveals avoidance—YES: The blocked bakery forces confrontation with Eleanor-memories
    he''d been sidestepping through routine. (3) Neighbor intersection—YES: Aliyah''s
    story (Chicago transplant, potter, faith in transformation) intersects meaningfully
    with Teddy''s grief-avoidance. (4) Late wife present through absence—YES: Eleanor
    appears as memory, powdered sugar, laughter, the blocked bakery as their shared
    space. (5) New path offers what old couldn''t—YES: The new route offers connection
    (Aliyah), creative beauty (the bowl), and active engagement versus passive curation.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Strong Story Circle structure. Ordinary World (40-year routine),
    Call to Adventure (barriers appear), Refusal (three mornings of waiting), Meeting
    the Mentor (Aliyah), Crossing the Threshold (deliberately routing past her house),
    Tests/Allies (tea, conversation, learning her story), Approach (recognizing her
    faith in transformation), Ordeal (internal conflict about remaining a ghost),
    Reward (the bowl), Road Back (walking past old route), Resolution (continuing
    forward with new path). The final image—adjusting the bowl and continuing toward
    lilacs—provides closure while honoring what was lost.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: 0.88. Prose is lyrical and precise. Metaphors work (''lock
    on a door,'' ''splinter,'' ''ghost in his own life''). Sensory details ground
    emotion. The bowl as symbol is earned, not imposed. Dialogue feels natural. Pacing
    balances reflection with action. Minor weakness: some transitions between route-searching
    feel slightly rushed (''He cut through an alley...then past a coffee shop'').
    The ending is resonant—the deliberate choice to not look down the blocked street
    while holding the new bowl captures the story''s emotional truth. The lilacs callback
    provides cyclical satisfaction.'
