  evidence: The revisions show a clear effort to incorporate feedback and strengthen
    the narrative. The initial versions were good, but subsequent revisions added
    layers of complexity and character depth, particularly in how Marcus's sadness
    is revealed and how the new writer perceives him. The final version successfully
    integrates all constraints while maintaining a strong narrative flow. The humor
    is present early, Marcus's sadness is subtly introduced and then explicitly stated,
    the theme is delivered by Maya, and Marcus's near-breakdown is well-executed.
    The writers' room feels authentic, and both Marcus and Maya are well-developed
    characters.
