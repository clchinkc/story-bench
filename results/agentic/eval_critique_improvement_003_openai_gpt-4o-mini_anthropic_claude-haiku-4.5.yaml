  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.4): The three critiques consistently flagged
    youth_voice issues (scores 0.63-0.68), identifying problems with adult-like narrative
    intrusions (''spark in a room full of shadows,'' ''shouting into a void''). However,
    the final output RETAINS these exact problems—the narrative still contains phrases
    like ''her heart raced with excitement'' and ''a spark of hope flickered into
    life'' that feel authorial rather than authentically 12-year-old. The revisions
    show minimal substantive changes to address the core critique. IMPROVEMENT_TRAJECTORY
    (0.3): Versions 1-3 are nearly identical to each other and show only cosmetic
    changes from Version 0 (removing ''sprightly,'' adding ''cozy''). The trajectory
    is essentially flat. The youth_voice weakness persists unchanged across all versions
    despite being the primary critique focus. No meaningful structural or voice improvements
    are evident. PRESERVATION (0.5): Strengths like dialogue (''Maybe I''m a kid,
    but I''m not wrong!'') and the wind-powered purifier invention are maintained.
    However, the attempt to preserve authentic voice is undermined by the narrative
    voice problems that weren''t addressed. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.6/5): (1) Competence
    without unrealism—SATISFIED: Zara''s purifier works ''most of the time'' and she
    uses instincts rather than superhuman abilities. (2) Adult dismissal—SATISFIED:
    Leo says ''You''re a kid; you don''t know what you''re talking about.'' (3) Flawed
    mentor—PARTIALLY SATISFIED: Leo''s past seawall failure is mentioned but underdeveloped;
    his flaw isn''t deeply integrated into the narrative or his decision-making. (4)
    Zara''s invention—SATISFIED: Wind-powered water purifier is clearly demonstrated.
    (5) Real danger in crossing—WEAK/UNSATISFIED: The storm is generic and resolved
    too quickly (''Finally, they reached the archive''). The danger feels perfunctory
    rather than genuinely threatening; there''s no sense of real consequence or difficult
    choices. The raft ''pitched violently'' but they escape without meaningful struggle.
    BEAT_EXECUTION (0.65): Call to adventure (map discovery)—clear. Refusal/mentor
    encounter—present but rushed. Crossing/trials—exists but underdeveloped; storm
    lacks visceral tension. Ordeal—minimal; archive entry is anticlimactic. Return
    with elixir—achieved but hollow. The Hero''s Journey structure is present but
    beats lack depth and earned emotional weight. NARRATIVE_QUALITY (0.58): Strengths
    include clear worldbuilding (floating platforms, recycled materials, post-climate
    setting) and a coherent plot. Weaknesses: (a) Youth voice remains inconsistent—dialogue
    is age-appropriate but narrative prose is not; (b) Pacing is rushed, especially
    the climactic storm sequence; (c) Emotional stakes feel told rather than shown
    (''her heart raced,'' ''her face glowing with triumph''); (d) Leo''s character
    arc is underdeveloped; (e) The ending is saccharine (''new spark of hope flickered
    into life'') despite the hope_balance criterion. The story reads as competent
    but generic middle-grade fiction that doesn''t fully commit to its constraints.'
