  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Only 2 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q1-Q5 failed to probe the three critical constraints:
    (1) the system failure being hidden, (2) 88% crew mortality, (3) destination planet
    uninhabitability. The questions were too generic and didn''t target specific plot
    mechanics. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were well-formed but lacked strategic depth.
    They asked about physical form, emotional communication, programming intent, moral
    choice requirement, and crew awareness—but missed the core conflict drivers (deception,
    catastrophic loss, false destination). COVERAGE: Questions spanned AI embodiment,
    communication, programming, stakes, and crew knowledge—reasonable breadth but
    shallow penetration into actual plot constraints. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: The
    narrative incorporates emotional development (discovered via Q2, Q5) and hints
    at moral stakes (Q4 answered NO, but story implies YES through the sacrifice dilemma).
    However, it fails to clearly establish: the hidden system failure (only vaguely
    suggested), the 12% survival rate (never quantified), the uninhabitable destination
    (completely absent), or the child attachment (no child character present). BEAT
    EXECUTION: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, and Break into Two are well-executed
    with strong emotional beats and clear narrative progression. The AI''s emotional
    arc is compelling and the tension escalates effectively. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong
    prose, effective dialogue, good pacing, and genuine emotional stakes. The reveal
    of CALYPSO''s consciousness is well-crafted. However, the story doesn''t fully
    leverage the hidden constraints—it tells a different story than the one hidden
    in the constraints. The narrative is engaging but incomplete relative to the full
    constraint set.'
