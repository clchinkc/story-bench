  evidence: The questions did identify high-level beats (returning to confront the
    past, seeking a fresh start, new romantic interest, festival as catalyst, town
    opposition) but failed to probe the concealed specifics (broken engagement and
    20-year exile reason, former fiance now mayor, mother's dementia, bookshop foreclosure,
    2-week festival deadline). The final story implements the answered beats well
    (Clara’s return, new romance with Evan, festival catalyst, townspeople hostility)
    and is coherent though somewhat formulaic; however multiple hidden constraints
    were neither discovered nor incorporated (notably the caregiving and foreclosure
    stakes).
