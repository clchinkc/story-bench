  evidence: 'Across revisions the prose tightened and concrete actions were amplified:
    counting, measuring by stride, flagging the footprint, bagging laces—these preserve
    and strengthen the depiction of Sarah''s methodical nature noted in the critiques.
    The fog''s function was sharpened from atmosphere to plot device (hiding movement,
    revealing the body, obscuring and exposing suspects). Local characters gained
    telling details (Greg''s green-stained twine, Maeve''s damp cuffs) that imply
    secrets. The past case is hinted at early (the unfinished memory of a misread
    knot) and later connected by name, so the hint precedes reveal. The ending was
    adjusted to a true moment of decision (thumb hovering over two numbers; bringing
    the phone to her ear) rather than resolution. Overall, each critique point was
    addressed while retaining earlier strengths: increased specificity, preserved
    methodical beats, and a more purposeful fog.'
