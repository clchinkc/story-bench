  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0-2 show truncation, making full assessment difficult,
    but final output demonstrates substantial refinement. The opening remains strong
    across all versions, but final version adds psychological depth through the hollow
    ache description and the photograph revelation. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Internal
    conflict shown through physical sensations (hollow space, silken cord tightening,
    tremor of excitement vs. fear) rather than exposition—SATISFIED. (2) Grandmother
    moment crystallizes choice: the photograph of young Elena''s courage directly
    triggers Mateo''s realization that self-pursuit honors rather than betrays family
    legacy—SATISFIED. (3) Mr. Henderson genuinely understands the dilemma, offering
    wisdom about responsibility to self without dismissing family obligations—SATISFIED.
    (4) Cultural elements feel authentic: specific details (comal, evaporative cooler,
    citizenship renewal paperwork, Spanish phrases used naturally) integrated into
    emotional beats rather than decorative—SATISFIED. (5) Resolution earned through
    growth: Mateo moves from buried desire to action, but crucially, this emerges
    from understanding his grandmother''s own courage, not from rejecting her—SATISFIED.
    BEAT EXECUTION: The three required beats execute well: (a) Internal conflict established
    through contrast with friends and cataloging of obligations; (b) Mr. Henderson
    provides external perspective that plants seed; (c) Grandmother scene provides
    the crystallizing moment where Mateo recontextualizes his choice as honoring legacy.
    The final action (applying to program) flows naturally from this realization.
    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong sensory language (furnace, shimmering air, scent of
    shifts, cinnamon and coffee) maintains immersion. The metaphor of silken cord
    tightening is more sophisticated than simple possession. However, the final paragraph''s
    tone shifts slightly toward telling (''It wasn''t rebellion. It was just Mateo,
    finally, choosing to breathe for himself'')—a minor retreat into exposition after
    strong showing. The phrase ''his ancestors would understand'' risks sentimentality
    but lands because it''s earned through the photograph revelation. PRESERVATION:
    Core opening maintained throughout; character voice consistent; sensory details
    preserved and deepened; the Mr. Henderson introduction appears to be new/strengthened
    in final version, adding necessary adult perspective beat.'
