  evidence: The revisions show a clear effort to refine Zara's voice, particularly
    in the early paragraphs, incorporating suggestions from the critiques. The core
    strengths of the initial draft (vivid worldbuilding, Zara's ingenuity) were maintained
    while the voice was sharpened. The final version successfully integrates the requested
    constraints, particularly the mentor's flaw and the real danger of the crossing,
    which were not fully present in the initial snippets but are well-developed in
    the full text.
