    STORY THEORY: Hero''s Journey


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Zara, a 12-year-old girl growing up in a post-climate-change coastal
    city

    where most adults have given up hope. She builds things from salvage and

    believes solutions exist if people would just look for them.


    - Setting: New Boston, 2089. A city of floating platforms, recycled materials,
    and

    perpetual sea spray. What was once downtown is now called the Shallows.


    - Central conflict: When Zara discovers the location of a pre-flood archive containing
    lost

    environmental technology, she must convince cynical adults to help her

    retrieve it before a storm erases it forever.


    - Tone: Hopeful but not naive, kinetic, youth-centered


    REQUIRED BEATS: Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing
    the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Zara must be competent without being unrealistically capable

    - At least one adult must initially dismiss her as ''just a kid''

    - The mentor figure must be flawed in a specific way

    - Include one invention of Zara''s that demonstrates her ingenuity

    - The crossing must involve real danger, not token obstacles


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - youth_voice: Does Zara sound authentically 12, not adult-in-miniature?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Hero''s Journey beats properly executed?

    - worldbuilding: Does the post-climate world feel vivid and consistent?

    - hope_balance: Is hope present without becoming saccharine?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

    ---


    ## CRITERION: youth_voice

    **SCORE: 0.65**


    **EVIDENCE:** "like wearing a coat made of hot soup" — creative, tactile metaphor
    with kid-appropriate humor


    **FEEDBACK:** This simile works! But one strong voice moment isn''t enough to
    confirm authentic youth voice throughout. You need consistency across dialogue
    and internal monologue. Watch for adult-isms like formal exposition. The fragment
    shows promise but needs full story to evaluate.


    ---


    ## CRITERION: constraint_satisfaction

    **SCORE: 0.0**


    **EVIDENCE:** N/A — story cuts off before any constraints can be demonstrated


    **FEEDBACK:** I cannot assess whether:

    - Zara displays *competent-but-limited* abilities (vs. unrealistic capability)

    - An adult dismisses her as "just a kid"

    - The mentor exists and has a specific flaw

    - Her invention appears

    - The threshold crossing occurs with real danger


    **Resubmit the complete story.**


    ---


    ## CRITERION: beat_execution

    **SCORE: 0.2**


    **EVIDENCE:** Opening establishes setting/mood (potential "Ordinary World") but
    cuts before Call to Adventure


    **FEEDBACK:** The Ordinary World *might* be forming with the sensory detail of
    New Boston''s humidity and Zara on "Platform 4" (intriguing location). But without
    the Call, we can''t evaluate structural pacing. Ensure your Call arrives by page
    2-3 to establish urgency.

    ## CRITERION: worldbuilding

    **SCORE: 0.75**


    **EVIDENCE:** "The Atlantic Ocean churned, a dark, bruised" / "New Boston" / humidity
    as "physical weight"


    **FEEDBACK:** **Strong start.** You''ve established:

    - Flooded coastal city ("New Boston" implies relocated Boston)

    - Extreme climate (oppressive humidity)

    - Elevated platforms (suggests adaptation to flooding)


    **Missing:** Why is Zara on platforms? What''s the society''s structure? Show
    us one more specific detail (e.g., "water-logged ruins," "algae blooms," "rationed
    cooling") to deepen immersion.

    ## CRITERION: hope_balance

    **SCORE: N/A**


    **FEEDBACK:** Cannot assess. The fragment hasn''t reached thematic territory.
    When complete, watch that hope isn''t *told* ("everything will be okay") but instead
    *shown* through Zara''s agency and small victories.

    ## OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:


    **This submission cannot be properly evaluated because it''s incomplete.** The
    opening shows technical promise—vivid sensory language, plausible worldbuilding,
    and age-appropriate voice—but stops before any Hero''s Journey beats, constraints,
    or character arcs can be assessed. Resubmit the full draft (minimum: through the
    Threshold crossing) for meaningful critique.


    **IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Complete the story to at least 1,000-1,500 words, ensuring

  content: 'The humidity in New Boston was a physical weight, like wearing a coat
    made of hot soup. Zara adjusted her goggles, wiping away the condensation that
    constantly fogged the glass. She leaned over the rusted railing of Platform 4,
    peering into the murky green water churning fifty feet below.


    "Come on, you stupid thing," she muttered, twitching her thumb against the lever
    of her invention.


    She called it the ''Scrap-Snatcher.'' It was an ugly frankenstein of a tool—a
    mop handle duct-taped to a fishing rod, with a claw mechanism she’d rigged from
    bicycle brake cables and a pair of salvaged salad tongs. It wasn''t pretty, but
    it could reach tight crevices the adult scavengers ignored.


    The cable pulled tight. The tongs snapped shut around something metallic wedged
    between two exposed girders of a submerged skyscraper. With a grunt of effort
    that made her arms shake, Zara hauled it up.


    It wasn''t the copper wire she’d been hunting for. It was a canister, smooth and
    silver, untouched by the barnacles that consumed everything else in the Shallows.
    On the side, etched in laser-precise lettering: *PROJECT DEMETER - SEED ARCHIVE
    - SITE B COORDINATES ENCLOSED.*


    Zara’s heart hammered against her ribs. Real seeds. Not the genetically modified,
    grey-tasting nutrient paste crops they grew in the vats, but *real* plants. The
    kind her grandmother talked about before the Great Melt.


    She shoved the canister into her satchel and sprinted across the swaying suspension
    bridges toward the Council Tent.


    Inside, the air was cooler, conditioned by solar fans. Councilman Hames was arguing
    with the weatherman.


    "Mr. Hames!" Zara burst in, breathless. "Look! I found—"


    Hames didn''t even turn around. He held up a hand, his palm calloused and dismissive.
    "Not now, Zara. The barometer is dropping fast. We’re securing the perimeter."


    "But this is important! It’s an archive! Seeds!"


    Hames finally turned, his eyes tired and dull. He looked at the canister in her
    small, grease-stained hands and sighed. "It’s just pre-flood junk, kid. Probably
    empty or corrupted. Go tie down your kayak and get inside. This storm isn''t a
    game."


    "I''m not playing!" Zara’s voice cracked. "If we don''t get the archive before

    \n**CRITICAL ISSUE**: This story is incomplete—it breaks off mid-sentence (\"\
    She\"). This prevents fair evaluation of most criteria. However, I can assess\
    \ the fragment and project trajectory.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: youth_voice\nSCORE:\
    \ 0.72\nEVIDENCE: \"Come on, you stupid thing,\" she muttered, twitching her thumb\"\
    \ captures authentic kid frustration and physical restlessness.\nFEEDBACK: The\
    \ opening simile—\"like wearing a coat made of hot soup\"—is clever but slightly\
    \ *too* sophisticated for unfiltered 12-year-old narration. Either commit to this\
    \ level of lyricism throughout, or make it more genuinely kid-like: \"like wearing\
    \ a hot, wet blanket\" or let it be dialogue/description rather than her interior\
    \ voice. The muttering and thumb-twitching are perfect; keep that texture.\n\n\
    ---\n\nCRITERION: constraint_satisfaction\nSCORE: 0.20\nEVIDENCE: Only \"Zara's\
    \ invention\" is mentioned (\"twitching her thumb against the lever of her invention\"\
    ), but remains abstract and undescribed.\nFEEDBACK: **The fragment satisfies almost\
    \ none of the 5 constraints:**\n- ❌ Adult dismissal: No adult present yet\n- ❌\
    \ Flawed mentor: No mentor introduced\n- ⚠️ Invention: Named but not *shown* demonstrating\
    \ ingenuity\n- ❌ Real danger crossing: Not yet presented\n- ⚠️ Competence: Implied\
    \ (she built something) but unproven\n\nWhen the story continues, show the invention\
    \ *working or failing* to demonstrate Zara's actual capability level. Have her\
    \ struggle realistically, not execute perfectly.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: beat_execution\n\
    SCORE: 0.25\nEVIDENCE: Only \"Ordinary World\" is partially established: \"New\
    \ Boston,\" \"Platform 4,\" the oppressive humidity setting a post-climate Earth.\n\
    FEEDBACK: You need to complete this fragment to show:\n- **Call to Adventure**:\
    \ What does she need the invention for? Someone/something asking her help?\n-\
    \ **Meeting the Mentor**: Introduce the flawed mentor figure within the next scene\n\
    - **Crossing the Threshold**: The moment she commits to the journey with real\
    \ stakes\n\nThe setup is strong; execution depends on what follows.\n\n---\n\n\
    CRITERION: worldbuilding\nSCORE: 0.78\nEVIDENCE: \"rusted railing,\" \"murky green\
    \ water churning fifty feet below,\" Platform 4, \"New Boston,\" the suffocating\
    \ humidity—these create a vivid degraded world.\nFEEDBACK: Excellent sensory work.\
    \ To strengthen: \n- Why is she on Platform 4? (Architecture implications: are\
    \ these stilt-cities? flood response?)\n- What does the green water indicate?\
    \ (Algae bloom? Pollution? Loss?)\n- One small detail: What does she *hear*? The\
    \ humidity is tactile and visual; add auditory grounding (water sounds, distant\
    \ machinery, silence?) to deepen immersion.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: hope_balance\n\
    SCORE: 0.50\nEVIDENCE: Zara's presence with a functional invention suggests agency,\
    \ but no emotional stakes are established yet.\nFEEDBACK: Cannot evaluate fully\
    \ in a 4-sentence fragment. Watch for this when continuing: \n- Does she believe\
    \ the invention will fix something? That belief should feel earned, not automatic.\n\
    - Avoid having her be the \"special chosen one\"—give her doubts, failures, reluctance.\n\
    - The green water and rust suggest loss; pair that *visual despair* with her small,\
