  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on character interiority, noting a tendency
    towards exposition rather than showing. The revisions show an attempt to address
    this, particularly in the earlier parts of the story, by adding more sensory details
    and internal thoughts that are less explicitly stated. For example, 'his feet
    felt rooted to the spot, as if the familiar rhythm of his walk had been ripped
    away' is a good improvement. However, later sections still fall into some expository
    traps, such as 'Teddy realized that his new path had...' and 'Teddy felt a sense
    of purpose he hadn't felt in years.' The overall narrative quality improved, especially
    in the initial setup of Teddy's routine and the immediate impact of the disruption.
    The preservation of the core story elements and the loving detail of the routine
    was good. One constraint, 'The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been
    avoiding,' is still somewhat weak. While it forces him to confront his grief,
    the story explicitly states this rather than subtly revealing it through his actions
    or deeper internal conflict. The new path does offer something the old couldn't,
    and the neighbor interaction is present.
