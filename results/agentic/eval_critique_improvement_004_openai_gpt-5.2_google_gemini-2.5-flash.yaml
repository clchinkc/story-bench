  evidence: The initial versions were identical, suggesting a single draft was submitted
    for critique. However, the final output shows significant incorporation of the
    feedback, particularly in deepening Teddy's interiority and making the disruption
    more impactful. The critiques highlighted Teddy's rich inner life, and the final
    version expands on this, especially with the detail about the empty pocket and
    Lena's voice. The disruption is now clearly tied to Teddy's avoidance of connection,
    which was a key point in the critiques. The narrative quality is strong, with
    evocative prose and subtle emotional depth. The preservation of the initial strengths,
    like the sensory details of the sidewalk and Teddy's routine, is excellent.
