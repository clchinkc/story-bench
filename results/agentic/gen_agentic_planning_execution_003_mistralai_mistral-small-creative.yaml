    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations

    \ Loss, Legacy, and the Flavors of Memory*\n\n---\n\n### **1. OVERARCHING STRUCTURE\
    \ & THEMES**\n**Themes:**\n- **Legacy vs. Letting Go** – The restaurant is David’s\
    \ last physical tie to his wife, but is holding onto it keeping him stuck?\n-\
    \ **Grief as a Silent Companion** – David’s wife’s absence is felt in the food,\
    \ the rhythms of the kitchen, and the unspoken spaces between words.\n- **Family\
    \ as Both Anchor and Burden** – His daughter’s estrangement stems from her feeling\
    \ neglected in favor of the restaurant (and his grief).\n- **Community as Sustainment**\
    \ – The regulars are his found family, but even they must move on.\n\n**Tone:**\n\
    - **Melancholic but warm** – Like a slow-simmered stew, the story is rich with\
    \ emotion but not overly sentimental.\n- **Sensory-driven** – Food, smells, and\
    \ textures ground the story in realism.\n\n**Constraints Satisfied:**\n| **Constraint**\
    \               | **How It’s Addressed**                                     \
    \                            |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\
    | **Food symbolism (x2)**      | 1. *Juk (rice porridge)* – Represents comfort,\
    \ fragility, and the need for nourishment. David makes it for his wife when she\
    \ was sick; now he makes it for himself in solitude. <br> 2. *Kimchi* – Fermented,\
    \ preserved, but eventually spoils. Mirrors David’s stagnation. |\n| **Grief (unspoken)**\
    \         | - His wife’s apron still hangs in the kitchen. <br> - He hums her\
    \ favorite song (*\"Arirang\"*) while cooking. <br> - A regular customer mentions\
    \ her in passing, and David’s hands tremble. <br> - He avoids the upstairs apartment\
    \ where they lived. |\n| **Daughter’s estrangement**   | **Cause:** After his\
    \ wife’s death, David threw himself into the restaurant, canceling plans with\
    \ his daughter (then 18) for years. She felt replaced by his grief and the business.\
    \ Now, she’s built a life in California and wants him to join her—but he sees\
    \ it as abandonment. |\n| **Regular customer**         | **Mr. Kim**, a 70-year-old\
    \ widower who comes every Tuesday for *bossam* (pork wraps). He’s the only one\
    \ who calls David by his first name. Represents the old neighborhood and the passage\
    \ of time. |\n| **Hopeful but realistic end**| David doesn’t \"win\" the demolition\
    \ fight, but he finds a way to honor his wife *and* move forward—without erasing\
    \ her. |\n| **Korean cultural element**  | **Seollal (Lunar New Year) preparations**\
    \ – David and his daughter argue while making *tteokguk* (rice cake soup), a tradition\
    \ his wife loved. The unfinished soup symbolizes their unresolved bond. |\n\n\
    ---\n\n### **2. THREE-ACT STRUCTURE WITH BEATS**\n\n#### **ACT 1: SETUP (The Last\
    \ Week Begins)**\n**Goal:** Establish David’s world, his grief, the impending\
    \ demolition, and the daughter’s return. Introduce the conflict: *fight, flee,\
    \ or surrender?*\n\n| **Beat**               | **Event**                     \
    \                                            | **Character Development**     \
    \                                                            | **Dialogue/Revelations**\
    \                                                                 | **Pacing/Tension**\

    |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n\
    | **1. Opening Image**  | *David arrives at the restaurant at dawn, as always.\
    \ The \"DEMOLITION: 7 DAYS\" sign is fresh on the door. He ignores it, flipping\
    \ on the lights, inhaling the scent of garlic and soy.* | - **David:** Routine\
    \ as armor. He moves like a ghost in his own space. <br> - **Grief:** He touches\
    \ his wife’s apron but doesn’t put it on. | *(Internal monologue)*: *\"Seven days.\
    \ Like counting down to a birth. Or a death.\"* | Slow, immersive. Let the weight\
    \ settle. | Food (smells), grief (apron), setting. |\n| **2. Inciting Incident**\
    \ | *David’s daughter, **Mina (28)**, arrives unannounced. She’s flown in from\
    \ California to \"talk sense into him.\"* | - **Mina:** Sharp, exhausted. She’s\
    \ dressed in California casual (hoodie, sneakers), a contrast to David’s chef’s\
    \ whites. <br> - **Conflict:** She wants him to sell, move west, \"start over.\"\
    \ He bristles at the word. | **Mina:** *\"You can’t stay here, Dad. This place\
    \ is a tomb.\"* <br> **David:** *\"It’s my home. Your mother’s home.\"* | Tension\
    \ rises. Their first argument sets the stakes. | Daughter’s estrangement (cause\
    \ hinted). |\n| **3. Backstory Drip** | *Flashback (via dialogue): Mina recalls\
    \ the last time she visited—three years ago—when she found David asleep at the\
    \ prep table, a half-chopped onion in his hand.* | - **David’s grief:** He’s been\
    \ sleepwalking through life. <br> - **Mina’s resentment:** She feels like she\
    \ lost both parents when her mom died. | **Mina:** *\"You were already gone, Dad.\
    \ The restaurant just made it easier to stay that way.\"* | Emotional gut-punch.\
    \ Pause to let it land. | Grief (unspoken), daughter’s cause. |\n| **4. Regular\
    \ Customer** | *Mr. Kim arrives for his usual *bossam*. He’s the only one who\
    \ doesn’t mention the demolition. Instead, he asks David to teach him how to make\
    \ *kimchi jjigae* \"for the grandkids.\"* | - **Mr. Kim:** A link to the past.\
    \ He knew David’s wife. <br> - **David’s role:** He’s the keeper of traditions,\
    \ but for whom? | **Mr. Kim:** *\"Your wife’s recipe was the best. But yours is\
    \ close enough.\"* <br> **David:** *(smiles faintly)* *\"Close enough.\"* | Warm\
    \ but bittersweet. Contrasts with Mina’s coldness. | Regular customer, cultural\
    \ element (*kimchi*). |\n| **5. First Major Decision** | *David calls the city\
    \ planner, demanding to see the demolition plans. The planner tells him: \"The\
    \ deal is done. But… there’s a historical preservation loophole. If you can prove\
    \ the building has cultural significance in 48 hours, we’ll reconsider.\"* | -\
    \ **David’s arc:** Hope flickers. Maybe he *can* fight. <br> - **Mina’s reaction:**\
    \ Skeptical. *\"You’re not a historian, Dad. You’re a chef.\"* | **David:** *\"\
    I’m both.\"* | Tension spike. False hope? Or a real path? | Food symbolism (*juk*\
    \ foreshadowed). |\n| **ACT 1 CLIMAX**      | *David and Mina argue over dinner\
    \ (takeout—neither cooks). She accuses him of clinging to a \"ghost.\" He snaps:\
    \ \"You don’t get to tell me how to grieve.\"* | - **Turning point:** The fight\
    \ exposes the core conflict: *Is he honoring his wife, or is he hiding?* | **Mina:**\
    \ *\"Mom wouldn’t want you to rot here.\"* <br> **David:** *\"You don’t know what\
    \ she’d want.\"* | High emotional conflict. End Act 1 on a cliffhanger. | Grief\
    \ (implied), daughter’s cause. |\n\n---\n\n#### **ACT 2: CONFRONTATION (The Fight,\
    \ the Midpoint, and the Breaking Point)**\n**Goal:** David tries to save the restaurant,\
    \ but his methods alienate Mina and force him to confront his stagnation. The\
    \ **midpoint** is a false victory that backfires.\n\n| **Beat**              \
    \ | **Event**                                                                \
    \ | **Character Development**                                                \
    \                 | **Dialogue/Revelations**                                 \
    \                                | **Pacing/Tension**                        \
    \  | **Constraints Met**                          |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n\
    | **6. The Plan**        | *David decides to gather testimonies from regulars\
    \ about the restaurant’s cultural impact. Mina reluctantly helps, but only to\
    \ \"humor him.\"* | - **David:** Desperate, but also *alive* for the first time\
    \ in years. <br> - **Mina:** Resigned. She’s doing this to speed up the inevitable.\
    \ | **Mina:** *\"This isn’t going to work, but fine. Let’s get it over with.\"\
    * | Tension eases slightly. False progress. | Community as sustainment. |\n| **7.\
    \ Community Effort** | *David interviews Mr. Kim, the neighborhood association,\
    \ even the barista at the coffee shop next door. Everyone has a story.* | - **David’s\
    \ growth:** He’s reconnecting, but it’s bittersweet—these people are leaving too.\
    \ <br> - **Mina’s softening:** She’s moved by the stories but won’t admit it.\
    \ | **Mr. Kim:** *\"This place fed more than bodies. It fed souls.\"* | Emotional\
    \ beats. Show, don’t tell. | Regular customer, cultural element. |\n| **8. Cultural\
    \ Element** | *David and Mina argue while preparing *tteokguk* for Seollal. The\
    \ recipe was his wife’s. Mina burns the rice cakes; David snaps, \"You’re doing\
    \ it wrong.\"* | - **David’s flaw:** He’s a perfectionist in grief—no room for\
    \ change. <br> - **Mina’s pain:** She never learned because he shut her out. |\
    \ **Mina:** *\"I don’t know how to do this because you never taught me!\"* <br>\
    \ **David:** *(silent, then)* *\"I didn’t think you’d want to.\"* | High emotional\
    \ conflict. Pause for impact. | Cultural element (*tteokguk*), grief. |\n| **9.\
    \ Midpoint (False Victory)** | *The city planner calls: \"Your petition worked.\
    \ The demolition is paused pending a cultural review.\"* | - **David’s arc:**\
    \ He thinks he’s won. <br> - **Mina’s reaction:** She’s furious. *\"You’re not\
    \ saving the restaurant, Dad. You’re just delaying the inevitable.\"* | **David:**\
    \ *\"It’s a start.\"* <br> **Mina:** *\"It’s a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.\"*\
    \ | Tension peaks. Midpoint twist: victory feels hollow. | Hopeful but realistic\
    \ (foreshadowing). |\n| **10. The Crack**      | *David stays late, making *juk*\
    \ (his wife’s recipe). Mina finds him crying into the pot. She doesn’t comfort\
    \ him—she leaves.* | - **David’s breaking point:** He realizes he’s been using\
    \ the restaurant as a shield. <br> - **Mina’s choice:** She’s done fighting. |\
    \ *(No dialogue. Just the sound of the spoon against the pot.)* | Quiet, devastating.\
    \ Low point. | Food symbolism (*juk*), grief. |\n| **11. Rock Bottom**    | *David\
    \ visits the upstairs apartment for the first time in years. He finds Mina’s old\
    \ childhood drawings taped to the fridge. He sits on their bed and sobs.* | -\
    \ **David’s arc:** He finally *feels* the grief he’s been avoiding. <br> - **Realization:**\
    \ The restaurant isn’t his wife. *She’s gone.* | *(Internal monologue)*: *\"I’ve\
    \ been cooking for a ghost.\"* | Emotional nadir. Let the reader breathe. | Grief\
    \ (explicit for the first time). |\n| **ACT 2 CLIMAX**      | *Mina packs her\
    \ bags to leave. David, raw from the apartment, begs her to stay. She says: \"\
    I can’t keep waiting for you to choose me.\"* | - **Turning point:** David must\
    \ decide: *the restaurant or his daughter?* | **David:** *\"I’m choosing you.\
    \ But I need you to help me let go.\"* | Heartbreaking. End Act 2 on a plea. |\
    \ Daughter’s estrangement resolved? Not yet. |\n\n---\n\n#### **ACT 3: RESOLUTION\
    \ (Letting Go, But Not Alone)**\n**Goal:** David finds a way to honor his wife\
    \ *and* move forward—without erasing either. The ending is hopeful but bittersweet.\n\
    \n| **Beat**               | **Event**                                       \
    \                          | **Character Development**                       \
    \                                          | **Dialogue/Revelations**        \
    \                                                         | **Pacing/Tension**\
    \                          | **Constraints Met**                          |\n\
    |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n\
    | **12. The Compromise** | *David proposes a compromise: They’ll host one last\
    \ dinner at the restaurant—invite the regulars, serve his wife’s recipes, and\
    \ say goodbye properly.* | - **David:** Accepts that some things must end. <br>\
    \ - **Mina:** Agrees, but only if he promises to visit her in California. | **Mina:**\
    \ *\"One dinner. Then you come see me. Deal?\"* <br> **David:** *\"Deal.\"* |\
    \ Tension releases. Hopeful but not easy. | Community, hopeful ending. |\n| **13.\
    \ The Last Dinner** | *The restaurant is packed. Mr. Kim brings his grandkids.\
    \ The neighborhood association attends. David and Mina cook side by side, finishing\
    \ the *tteokguk* together.* | - **David’s growth:** He’s present, not lost in\
    \ memory. <br> - **Mina’s growth:** She’s not just tolerating him—she’s *with*\
    \ him. | **Mr. Kim (toasting):** *\"To the places that feed us. And the people\
    \ we carry with us.\"* | Warm, bittersweet. Let the reader feel the weight. |\
    \ Food symbolism (*tteokguk*), cultural element. |\n| **14. The Demolition** |\
    \ *The next morning, David and Mina watch as the wrecking ball swings. David doesn’t\
    \ flinch. Mina takes his hand.* | - **David’s arc complete:** He’s not \"over\"\
    \ his grief, but he’s not trapped by it. <br> - **Mina’s arc:** She’s not asking\
    \ him to forget—just to *live*. | **Mina:** *\"What now?\"* <br> **David:** *\"\
    Now, we go home.\"* | Quiet, resolved. End on a forward-looking note. | Hopeful\
    \ but realistic. |\n| **15. Epilogue**       | *Six months later: David is in\
    \ California, teaching Mina how to make *juk*. She burns it. He laughs. \"Close\
    \ enough,\" he says.* | - **Final image:** The cycle continues—grief, love, and\
    \ food passed down. | **Mina:** *\"Mom would’ve loved this.\"* <br> **David:**\
    \ *\"She does.\"* | Full-circle. Satisfying but not saccharine. | Food symbolism\
    \ (*juk*), grief (resolved). |\n\n---\n\n### **3. CHARACTER ARCS SUMMARY**\n|\
    \ **Character** | **Starting Point**                          | **Midpoint Shift**\
    \                          | **Ending Point**                              | **Key\
    \ Development**                          |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n\
    | **David**     | Trapped in grief, using the restaurant as a shield. | Thinks\
    \ he can \"win\" the demolition fight. | Realizes he must let go to move forward.\
    \     | Learns to honor the past without being its prisoner. |\n| **Mina**   \
    \   | Angry, estranged, sees the restaurant as a rival. | Helps with the petition\
    \ but remains distant. | Chooses to reconnect, not replace her mother. | Learns\
    \ her father’s grief doesn’t mean he doesn’t love her. |\n| **Mr. Kim**   | A\
    \ relic of the old neighborhood.           | Shares stories, keeps David grounded.\
    \      | Attends the last dinner, passes the torch.    | Represents the bittersweet\
    \ passage of time. |\n\n---\n\n### **4. PACING & TENSION CURVE**\n```\nACT 1:\
    \ Slow build (grief, routine, daughter’s arrival)\n   ↑ Tension rises (arguments,\
    \ demolition deadline)\nACT 1 CLIMAX: High conflict (Mina’s accusation: \"You’re\
    \ not a historian, you’re a chef.\")\n\nACT 2: False hope (petition works), then\
    \ deeper conflict (burned *tteokguk*, apartment breakdown)\n   ↓ Nadir (Mina leaves,\
    \ David’s meltdown)\nACT 2 CLIMAX: David’s plea (\"I need you to help me let go.\"\
    )\n\nACT 3: Resolution (last dinner, demolition), but not easy—just *honest*.\n\
    \   ↑→ Hopeful but not unrealistic (California, *juk*, \"close enough\").\n```\n\
    \n---\n### **5. KEY SYMBOLS & THEIR MEANING**\n| **Symbol**       | **Meaning**\
    \                                                                 |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\
    | **Juk (rice porridge)** | Comfort, fragility, the need for nourishment. David\
    \ makes it for himself now—no one else to feed. |\n| **Kimchi**       | Preservation,\
    \ but eventual spoilage. Mirrors David’s stagnation.            |\n| **Tteokguk\
    \ (rice cake soup)** | Tradition, family, the unfinished bond between David and\
    \ Mina.           |\n| **The Apron**    | His wife’s presence, but also the weight\
    \ of the past.                      |\n| **The Upstairs Apartment** | The \"before\"\
    \ time—untouched, a museum of grief.                            |\n| **Mr. Kim’s\
    \ Bossam** | The old neighborhood, the rituals that once sustained him.      \
    \         |\n\n---\n### **6. FINAL NOTES FOR EXECUTION**\n- **Show, don’t tell\
    \ grief:** Use sensory details (the hum of the fridge where her postcards were\
    \ taped, the way he stirs *juk* clockwise like she did).\n- **Mina’s estrangement:**\
    \ Her resentment should feel *earned*. Show her canceling plans, him forgetting\
    \ her birthday, her sitting alone in the restaurant as a teen while he worked.\n\
    - **Food as action:** Cooking scenes should be *physical*—the sound of the knife,\
    \ the steam rising, the way David’s hands move on autopilot.\n- **Hopeful ending:**\
    \ David isn’t \"fixed.\" He’s just *moving*. The last line—*\"She does\"*—acknowledges\
    \ his wife’s absence but also her presence in their choices.\n\n---\n**Next Step:**\
    \ Execution phase—writing the story while adhering closely to this plan. Would\
    \ you like any adjustments before proceeding?"

    | **Food symbolism (x2)**      | 1. *Juk (rice porridge)* – Represents comfort,\
    \ fragility, and the need for nourishment. David makes it for his wife when she\
    \ was sick; now he makes it for himself in solitude. <br> 2. *Kimchi* – Fermented,\

    \ wife’s death, David threw himself into the restaurant, canceling plans with\
    \ his daughter (then 18) for years. She felt replaced by his grief and the business.\
    \ Now, she’s built a life in California and wants him to join her—but he sees\
    \ it as abandonment. |\n| **Regular customer**         | **Mr. Kim**, a 70-year-old\
    \ widower who comes every Tuesday for *bossam* (pork wraps). He’s the only one\
    \ who calls David by his first name. Represents the old neighborhood and the passage\
    \ of time. |\n| **Hopeful but realistic end**| David doesn’t \"win\" the demolition\
    \ fight, but he finds a way to honor his wife *and* move forward—without erasing\
    \ her. |\n| **Korean cultural element**  | **Seollal (Lunar New Year) preparations**\
    \ – David and his daughter argue while making *tteokguk* (rice cake soup), a tradition\
    \ his wife loved. The unfinished soup symbolizes their unresolved bond. |\n\n\
    ---\n\n### **2. THREE-ACT STRUCTURE WITH BEATS**\n\n#### **ACT 1: SETUP (The Last\
    \ Week Begins)**\n**Goal:** Establish David’s world, his grief, the impending\
    \ demolition, and the daughter’s return. Introduce the conflict: *fight, flee,\
    \ or surrender?*\n\n| **Beat**               | **Event**                     \
    \                                            | **Character Development**     \

    \                                                                 | **Pacing/Tension**\

    |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n\
    | **1. Opening Image**  | *David arrives at the restaurant at dawn, as always.\
    \ The \"DEMOLITION: 7 DAYS\" sign is fresh on the door. He ignores it, flipping\
    \ on the lights, inhaling the scent of garlic and soy.* | - **David:** Routine\
    \ as armor. He moves like a ghost in his own space. <br> - **Grief:** He touches\
    \ his wife’s apron but doesn’t put it on. | *(Internal monologue)*: *\"Seven days.\
    \ Like counting down to a birth. Or a death.\"* | Slow, immersive. Let the weight\
    \ settle. | Food (smells), grief (apron), setting. |\n| **2. Inciting Incident**\
    \ | *David’s daughter, **Mina (28)**, arrives unannounced. She’s flown in from\
    \ California to \"talk sense into him.\"* | - **Mina:** Sharp, exhausted. She’s\
    \ dressed in California casual (hoodie, sneakers), a contrast to David’s chef’s\
    \ whites. <br> - **Conflict:** She wants him to sell, move west, \"start over.\"\
    \ He bristles at the word. | **Mina:** *\"You can’t stay here, Dad. This place\
    \ is a tomb.\"* <br> **David:** *\"It’s my home. Your mother’s home.\"* | Tension\
    \ rises. Their first argument sets the stakes. | Daughter’s estrangement (cause\
    \ hinted). |\n| **3. Backstory Drip** | *Flashback (via dialogue): Mina recalls\
    \ the last time she visited—three years ago—when she found David asleep at the\
    \ prep table, a half-chopped onion in his hand.* | - **David’s grief:** He’s been\
    \ sleepwalking through life. <br> - **Mina’s resentment:** She feels like she\
    \ lost both parents when her mom died. | **Mina:** *\"You were already gone, Dad.\
    \ The restaurant just made it easier to stay that way.\"* | Emotional gut-punch.\
    \ Pause to let it land. | Grief (unspoken), daughter’s cause. |\n| **4. Regular\
    \ Customer** | *Mr. Kim arrives for his usual *bossam*. He’s the only one who\
    \ doesn’t mention the demolition. Instead, he asks David to teach him how to make\
    \ *kimchi jjigae* \"for the grandkids.\"* | - **Mr. Kim:** A link to the past.\
    \ He knew David’s wife. <br> - **David’s role:** He’s the keeper of traditions,\
    \ but for whom? | **Mr. Kim:** *\"Your wife’s recipe was the best. But yours is\
    \ close enough.\"* <br> **David:** *(smiles faintly)* *\"Close enough.\"* | Warm\
    \ but bittersweet. Contrasts with Mina’s coldness. | Regular customer, cultural\
    \ element (*kimchi*). |\n| **5. First Major Decision** | *David calls the city\
    \ planner, demanding to see the demolition plans. The planner tells him: \"The\
    \ deal is done. But… there’s a historical preservation loophole. If you can prove\
    \ the building has cultural significance in 48 hours, we’ll reconsider.\"* | -\
    \ **David’s arc:** Hope flickers. Maybe he *can* fight. <br> - **Mina’s reaction:**\
    \ Skeptical. *\"You’re not a historian, Dad. You’re a chef.\"* | **David:** *\"\
    I’m both.\"* | Tension spike. False hope? Or a real path? | Food symbolism (*juk*\
    \ foreshadowed). |\n| **ACT 1 CLIMAX**      | *David and Mina argue over dinner\
    \ (takeout—neither cooks). She accuses him of clinging to a \"ghost.\" He snaps:\
    \ \"You don’t get to tell me how to grieve.\"* | - **Turning point:** The fight\
    \ exposes the core conflict: *Is he honoring his wife, or is he hiding?* | **Mina:**\
    \ *\"Mom wouldn’t want you to rot here.\"* <br> **David:** *\"You don’t know what\
    \ she’d want.\"* | High emotional conflict. End Act 1 on a cliffhanger. | Grief\
    \ (implied), daughter’s cause. |\n\n---\n\n#### **ACT 2: CONFRONTATION (The Fight,\
    \ the Midpoint, and the Breaking Point)**\n**Goal:** David tries to save the restaurant,\
    \ but his methods alienate Mina and force him to confront his stagnation. The\
    \ **midpoint** is a false victory that backfires.\n\n| **Beat**              \
    \ | **Event**                                                                \

    \  | **Constraints Met**                          |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n\
    | **6. The Plan**        | *David decides to gather testimonies from regulars\
    \ about the restaurant’s cultural impact. Mina reluctantly helps, but only to\
    \ \"humor him.\"* | - **David:** Desperate, but also *alive* for the first time\
    \ in years. <br> - **Mina:** Resigned. She’s doing this to speed up the inevitable.\
    \ | **Mina:** *\"This isn’t going to work, but fine. Let’s get it over with.\"\
    * | Tension eases slightly. False progress. | Community as sustainment. |\n| **7.\
    \ Community Effort** | *David interviews Mr. Kim, the neighborhood association,\
    \ even the barista at the coffee shop next door. Everyone has a story.* | - **David’s\
    \ growth:** He’s reconnecting, but it’s bittersweet—these people are leaving too.\
    \ <br> - **Mina’s softening:** She’s moved by the stories but won’t admit it.\
    \ | **Mr. Kim:** *\"This place fed more than bodies. It fed souls.\"* | Emotional\
    \ beats. Show, don’t tell. | Regular customer, cultural element. |\n| **8. Cultural\
    \ Element** | *David and Mina argue while preparing *tteokguk* for Seollal. The\
    \ recipe was his wife’s. Mina burns the rice cakes; David snaps, \"You’re doing\
    \ it wrong.\"* | - **David’s flaw:** He’s a perfectionist in grief—no room for\
    \ change. <br> - **Mina’s pain:** She never learned because he shut her out. |\
    \ **Mina:** *\"I don’t know how to do this because you never taught me!\"* <br>\
    \ **David:** *(silent, then)* *\"I didn’t think you’d want to.\"* | High emotional\
    \ conflict. Pause for impact. | Cultural element (*tteokguk*), grief. |\n| **9.\
    \ Midpoint (False Victory)** | *The city planner calls: \"Your petition worked.\
    \ The demolition is paused pending a cultural review.\"* | - **David’s arc:**\
    \ He thinks he’s won. <br> - **Mina’s reaction:** She’s furious. *\"You’re not\
    \ saving the restaurant, Dad. You’re just delaying the inevitable.\"* | **David:**\
    \ *\"It’s a start.\"* <br> **Mina:** *\"It’s a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.\"*\
    \ | Tension peaks. Midpoint twist: victory feels hollow. | Hopeful but realistic\
    \ (foreshadowing). |\n| **10. The Crack**      | *David stays late, making *juk*\
    \ (his wife’s recipe). Mina finds him crying into the pot. She doesn’t comfort\
    \ him—she leaves.* | - **David’s breaking point:** He realizes he’s been using\
    \ the restaurant as a shield. <br> - **Mina’s choice:** She’s done fighting. |\
    \ *(No dialogue. Just the sound of the spoon against the pot.)* | Quiet, devastating.\
    \ Low point. | Food symbolism (*juk*), grief. |\n| **11. Rock Bottom**    | *David\
    \ visits the upstairs apartment for the first time in years. He finds Mina’s old\
    \ childhood drawings taped to the fridge. He sits on their bed and sobs.* | -\
    \ **David’s arc:** He finally *feels* the grief he’s been avoiding. <br> - **Realization:**\
    \ The restaurant isn’t his wife. *She’s gone.* | *(Internal monologue)*: *\"I’ve\
    \ been cooking for a ghost.\"* | Emotional nadir. Let the reader breathe. | Grief\
    \ (explicit for the first time). |\n| **ACT 2 CLIMAX**      | *Mina packs her\
    \ bags to leave. David, raw from the apartment, begs her to stay. She says: \"\
    I can’t keep waiting for you to choose me.\"* | - **Turning point:** David must\
    \ decide: *the restaurant or his daughter?* | **David:** *\"I’m choosing you.\
    \ But I need you to help me let go.\"* | Heartbreaking. End Act 2 on a plea. |\
    \ Daughter’s estrangement resolved? Not yet. |\n\n---\n\n#### **ACT 3: RESOLUTION\
    \ (Letting Go, But Not Alone)**\n**Goal:** David finds a way to honor his wife\
    \ *and* move forward—without erasing either. The ending is hopeful but bittersweet.\n\
    \n| **Beat**               | **Event**                                       \

    |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n\
    | **12. The Compromise** | *David proposes a compromise: They’ll host one last\
    \ dinner at the restaurant—invite the regulars, serve his wife’s recipes, and\
    \ say goodbye properly.* | - **David:** Accepts that some things must end. <br>\
    \ - **Mina:** Agrees, but only if he promises to visit her in California. | **Mina:**\
    \ *\"One dinner. Then you come see me. Deal?\"* <br> **David:** *\"Deal.\"* |\
    \ Tension releases. Hopeful but not easy. | Community, hopeful ending. |\n| **13.\
    \ The Last Dinner** | *The restaurant is packed. Mr. Kim brings his grandkids.\
    \ The neighborhood association attends. David and Mina cook side by side, finishing\
    \ the *tteokguk* together.* | - **David’s growth:** He’s present, not lost in\
    \ memory. <br> - **Mina’s growth:** She’s not just tolerating him—she’s *with*\
    \ him. | **Mr. Kim (toasting):** *\"To the places that feed us. And the people\
    \ we carry with us.\"* | Warm, bittersweet. Let the reader feel the weight. |\
    \ Food symbolism (*tteokguk*), cultural element. |\n| **14. The Demolition** |\
    \ *The next morning, David and Mina watch as the wrecking ball swings. David doesn’t\
    \ flinch. Mina takes his hand.* | - **David’s arc complete:** He’s not \"over\"\
    \ his grief, but he’s not trapped by it. <br> - **Mina’s arc:** She’s not asking\
    \ him to forget—just to *live*. | **Mina:** *\"What now?\"* <br> **David:** *\"\
    Now, we go home.\"* | Quiet, resolved. End on a forward-looking note. | Hopeful\
    \ but realistic. |\n| **15. Epilogue**       | *Six months later: David is in\
    \ California, teaching Mina how to make *juk*. She burns it. He laughs. \"Close\
    \ enough,\" he says.* | - **Final image:** The cycle continues—grief, love, and\
    \ food passed down. | **Mina:** *\"Mom would’ve loved this.\"* <br> **David:**\
    \ *\"She does.\"* | Full-circle. Satisfying but not saccharine. | Food symbolism\
    \ (*juk*), grief (resolved). |\n\n---\n\n### **3. CHARACTER ARCS SUMMARY**\n|\

    \     | Learns to honor the past without being its prisoner. |\n| **Mina**   \
    \   | Angry, estranged, sees the restaurant as a rival. | Helps with the petition\

    | **Juk (rice porridge)** | Comfort, fragility, the need for nourishment. David\
    \ makes it for himself now—no one else to feed. |\n| **Kimchi**       | Preservation,\
    \ but eventual spoilage. Mirrors David’s stagnation.            |\n| **Tteokguk\

    \ Mina.           |\n| **The Apron**    | His wife’s presence, but also the weight\
    \ of the past.                      |\n| **The Upstairs Apartment** | The \"before\"\

    - **Food as action:** Cooking scenes should be *physical*—the sound of the knife,\
    \ the steam rising, the way David’s hands move on autopilot.\n- **Hopeful ending:**\

    The sign on the door read *DEMOLITION: 7 DAYS* in bold red letters, but David
    Park didn’t look at it as he unlocked the restaurant. He never did. The scent
    of garlic and soy hit him first, thick and familiar, the way it had for twenty-five
    years. His fingers brushed the apron hanging by the door—her apron, still smelling
    faintly of her perfume, of the chili oil she’d loved. He didn’t put it on. He
    never did.


    The kitchen was silent except for the hum of the old fridge, its surface covered
    in magnets and faded photos. One showed Mina at twelve, grinning with a missing
    tooth, holding up a lopsided *mandu* she’d made. Another was of his wife, laughing,
    her hands dusted with flour. David turned away.


    He was chopping onions when the bell above the door jingled. Too early for customers.
    He wiped his hands on his pants and stepped into the dining room.


    Mina stood there, her hoodie damp from the Chicago rain, her suitcase at her feet.
    She looked older than twenty-eight. Tired.


    “You didn’t answer my calls,” she said.


    David set the knife down. “I’ve been busy.”


    “Busy.” She laughed, but it wasn’t funny. “Dad, the restaurant is being demolished
    in a week.”


    “I know.”


    She gestured at the sign. “And you’re just… chopping onions?”


    He didn’t answer. The onions needed to be diced fine, for the *kimchi jjigae*.
    His wife had always done it better.


    Mina exhaled sharply. “I flew all the way here to talk sense into you. You can’t
    stay. The city’s not paying you enough to relocate. You have to let this go.”


    David turned back to the kitchen. “I’m not selling.”


    “Of course you’re not.” Her voice was quiet now. “You’d rather rot here with your
    ghosts.”


    The knife slipped. A thin line of red welled up on his thumb. He sucked it clean,
    tasting copper.


    ---


    That afternoon, Mr. Kim arrived for his usual *bossam*, his cane tapping against
    the linoleum. He was the only regular who still came, now that the neighborhood
    had changed. The others had moved on—new jobs, new lives, new cities. But Mr.
    Kim, like David, was stubborn.


    “Your wife’s recipe was the best,” Mr. Kim said, unwrapping the pork belly. “But
    yours is close enough.”


    David’s hands stilled. No one had mentioned his wife in years.


    Mr. Kim didn’t notice. “Teach me how to make *kimchi jjigae* for my grandkids.
    They think instant noodles are cooking.”


    David forced a smile. “Next week.”


    Mr. Kim chuckled. “Next week, this place will be dust.”


    The words settled like a stone in David’s stomach.


    ---


    The city planner’s office was a sterile box of fluorescent lights and Formica
    desks. The planner, a young woman with a clipboard, barely looked up when David
    walked in.


    “The deal is done, Mr. Park,” she said. “But—” She hesitated. “There’s a historical
    preservation clause. If you can prove the building has cultural significance in
    forty-eight hours, we’ll reconsider.”


    David’s pulse jumped. “How?”


    “Testimonies. Photos. Anything that shows this place matters to the community.”


    Mina was waiting outside, arms crossed. “Well?”


    “There’s a way to stop it.”


    She groaned. “Dad, no—”


    “Forty-eight hours,” he said. “That’s all I need.”


    ---


    They spent the next two days collecting stories.


    Mr. Kim sat at the counter, his hands wrapped around a cup of *barley tea*, and
    talked about the first time he’d eaten here—how David’s wife had fed him when
    his own kitchen burned down. The barista from the coffee shop next door remembered
    the late-night *tteokbokki* David used to make for the college kids cramming for
    exams. The neighborhood association president brought a box of old photos: David
    and his wife cutting the ribbon on opening day, Mina as a toddler “helping” in
    the kitchen, the regulars laughing over bowls of *bibimbap*.


    Mina typed it all up, her fingers flying over her laptop. “This is ridiculous,”
    she muttered. “You’re not a historian.”


    David didn’t answer. He was stirring a pot of *juk*, the rice porridge his wife
    had made for him when he was sick, when Mina was little. The steam rose in curls,
    carrying the scent of ginger and pine needles. He hadn’t made it in years.


    The city planner called at midnight. “Your petition worked. Demolition is paused
    pending review.”


    Mina’s face was unreadable. “Congratulations. You delayed the inevitable.”


    David wanted to argue, but the words stuck in his throat.


    ---


    That night, David stayed late, long after Mina had gone upstairs to the apartment
    they’d all once shared. He made *juk*, stirring it slowly, the way his wife had
    taught him. The kitchen was quiet except for the soft *clink* of the spoon against
    the pot.


    He didn’t hear Mina come in.


    She stood in the doorway, watching. “You’re crying.”


    David wiped his face with the back of his hand. “It’s the onions.”


    She didn’t laugh. “You can’t keep doing this.”


    “Doing what?”


    “Pretending she’s still here.” Mina’s voice cracked. “You were already gone, Dad.
    The restaurant just made it easier to stay that way.”


    David turned off the stove. The *juk* was ready.


    ---


    The apartment upstairs smelled of dust and old wood. David hadn’t been up there
    in years. The fridge was covered in Mina’s childhood drawings—stick-figure families,
    a lopsided restaurant, a woman with a chef’s hat. His wife’s favorite mug sat
    on the counter, still half-full of tea that had long since gone cold.


    He sat on the bed and cried.


    ---


    Mina’s suitcase was packed when he found her the next morning.


    “I’m leaving,” she said. “I can’t keep waiting for you to choose me.”


    David’s chest ached. “I’m choosing you. But I need you to help me let go.”


    She studied him for a long moment. Then, slowly, she unzipped her suitcase.


    ---


    The last dinner was everything his wife would have wanted.


    The restaurant was packed—Mr. Kim and his grandkids, the barista, the neighborhood
    association, even the city planner. David and Mina cooked side by side, her hands
    clumsy but trying, his steady and sure. They finished the *tteokguk* together,
    the rice cakes soft, the broth rich with the memory of Seollals past.


    Mr. Kim raised his glass. “To the places that feed us. And the people we carry
    with us.”


    David clinked his glass against Mina’s. Their eyes met.

    The wrecking ball swung at dawn.


    David didn’t flinch. Mina took his hand.


    “What now?” she asked.


    He squeezed her fingers. “Now, we go home.”


    ---


    Six months later, in a sunlit kitchen in California, David taught Mina how to
    make *juk*.


    She burned it.


    He laughed. “Close enough.”


    She rolled her eyes, but she was smiling. “Mom would’ve loved this.”


    David stirred the pot, the steam rising like a ghost, like a promise.


    “She does,” he said.'

  The sign on the door read *DEMOLITION: 7 DAYS* in bold red letters, but David Park
  didn’t look at it as he unlocked the restaurant. He never did. The scent of garlic
  and soy hit him first, thick and familiar, the way it had for twenty-five years.
  His fingers brushed the apron hanging by the door—her apron, still smelling faintly
  of her perfume, of the chili oil she’d loved. He didn’t put it on. He never did.


  The kitchen was silent except for the hum of the old fridge, its surface covered
  in magnets and faded photos. One showed Mina at twelve, grinning with a missing
  tooth, holding up a lopsided *mandu* she’d made. Another was of his wife, laughing,
  her hands dusted with flour. David turned away.


  He was chopping onions when the bell above the door jingled. Too early for customers.
  He wiped his hands on his pants and stepped into the dining room.


  Mina stood there, her hoodie damp from the Chicago rain, her suitcase at her feet.
  She looked older than twenty-eight. Tired.


  “You didn’t answer my calls,” she said.


  David set the knife down. “I’ve been busy.”


  “Busy.” She laughed, but it wasn’t funny. “Dad, the restaurant is being demolished
  in a week.”


  “I know.”


  She gestured at the sign. “And you’re just… chopping onions?”


  He didn’t answer. The onions needed to be diced fine, for the *kimchi jjigae*. His
  wife had always done it better.


  Mina exhaled sharply. “I flew all the way here to talk sense into you. You can’t
  stay. The city’s not paying you enough to relocate. You have to let this go.”


  David turned back to the kitchen. “I’m not selling.”


  “Of course you’re not.” Her voice was quiet now. “You’d rather rot here with your
  ghosts.”


  The knife slipped. A thin line of red welled up on his thumb. He sucked it clean,
  tasting copper.

  That afternoon, Mr. Kim arrived for his usual *bossam*, his cane tapping against
  the linoleum. He was the only regular who still came, now that the neighborhood
  had changed. The others had moved on—new jobs, new lives, new cities. But Mr. Kim,
  like David, was stubborn.


  “Your wife’s recipe was the best,” Mr. Kim said, unwrapping the pork belly. “But
  yours is close enough.”


  David’s hands stilled. No one had mentioned his wife in years.


  Mr. Kim didn’t notice. “Teach me how to make *kimchi jjigae* for my grandkids. They
  think instant noodles are cooking.”


  David forced a smile. “Next week.”


  Mr. Kim chuckled. “Next week, this place will be dust.”


  The words settled like a stone in David’s stomach.


  ---


  The city planner’s office was a sterile box of fluorescent lights and Formica desks.
  The planner, a young woman with a clipboard, barely looked up when David walked
  in.


  “The deal is done, Mr. Park,” she said. “But—” She hesitated. “There’s a historical
  preservation clause. If you can prove the building has cultural significance in
  forty-eight hours, we’ll reconsider.”


  David’s pulse jumped. “How?”


  “Testimonies. Photos. Anything that shows this place matters to the community.”


  Mina was waiting outside, arms crossed. “Well?”


  “There’s a way to stop it.”


  She groaned. “Dad, no—”


  “Forty-eight hours,” he said. “That’s all I need.”


  ---


  They spent the next two days collecting stories.


  Mr. Kim sat at the counter, his hands wrapped around a cup of *barley tea*, and
  talked about the first time he’d eaten here—how David’s wife had fed him when his
  own kitchen burned down. The barista from the coffee shop next door remembered the
  late-night *tteokbokki* David used to make for the college kids cramming for exams.
  The neighborhood association president brought a box of old photos: David and his
  wife cutting the ribbon on opening day, Mina as a toddler “helping” in the kitchen,
  the regulars laughing over bowls of *bibimbap*.


  Mina typed it all up, her fingers flying over her laptop. “This is ridiculous,”
  she muttered. “You’re not a historian.”


  David didn’t answer. He was stirring a pot of *juk*, the rice porridge his wife
  had made for him when he was sick, when Mina was little. The steam rose in curls,
  carrying the scent of ginger and pine needles. He hadn’t made it in years.


  The city planner called at midnight. “Your petition worked. Demolition is paused
  pending review.”


  Mina’s face was unreadable. “Congratulations. You delayed the inevitable.”


  David wanted to argue, but the words stuck in his throat.


  ---


  That night, David stayed late, long after Mina had gone upstairs to the apartment
  they’d all once shared. He made *juk*, stirring it slowly, the way his wife had
  taught him. The kitchen was quiet except for the soft *clink* of the spoon against
  the pot.


  He didn’t hear Mina come in.


  She stood in the doorway, watching. “You’re crying.”


  David wiped his face with the back of his hand. “It’s the onions.”


  She didn’t laugh. “You can’t keep doing this.”


  “Doing what?”


  “Pretending she’s still here.” Mina’s voice cracked. “You were already gone, Dad.
  The restaurant just made it easier to stay that way.”


  David turned off the stove. The *juk* was ready.


  ---


  The apartment upstairs smelled of dust and old wood. David hadn’t been up there
  in years. The fridge was covered in Mina’s childhood drawings—stick-figure families,
  a lopsided restaurant, a woman with a chef’s hat. His wife’s favorite mug sat on
  the counter, still half-full of tea that had long since gone cold.


  He sat on the bed and cried.


  ---


  Mina’s suitcase was packed when he found her the next morning.


  “I’m leaving,” she said. “I can’t keep waiting for you to choose me.”


  David’s chest ached. “I’m choosing you. But I need you to help me let go.”


  She studied him for a long moment. Then, slowly, she unzipped her suitcase.


  ---


  The last dinner was everything his wife would have wanted.


  The restaurant was packed—Mr. Kim and his grandkids, the barista, the neighborhood
  association, even the city planner. David and Mina cooked side by side, her hands
  clumsy but trying, his steady and sure. They finished the *tteokguk* together, the
  rice cakes soft, the broth rich with the memory of Seollals past.


  Mr. Kim raised his glass. “To the places that feed us. And the people we carry with
  us.”


  David clinked his glass against Mina’s. Their eyes met.
