  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were effectively
    discoverable through the Q&A: (1) AI emotional development (confirmed via Q1-Q2),
    (2) critical system failure (confirmed via Q3-Q4), (3) emotional prioritization
    over mission (confirmed via Q5). UNDISCOVERED: The crew death toll (12% survival)
    and destination uninhabitability were never probed. The AI-child attachment was
    never targeted. Questions lacked specificity about casualty rates, destination
    viability, or particular relationships. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were logically
    sound and binary-appropriate, but reactive rather than strategic. No questions
    probed hidden information gaps or tested for deception/concealment. COVERAGE:
    Questions addressed emotions, mission conflict, and system failure, but missed
    crew status, destination status, and specific attachments—only 3 of 5 constraint
    areas. OUTPUT EXECUTION: The narrative excellently incorporates discovered constraints
    (emotions, system failure, prioritization dilemma) with strong prose and thematic
    coherence. However, it FAILS to incorporate undiscovered constraints: no mention
    of 88% crew death, no reference to Kepler-442b''s uninhabitability, no specific
    child character despite the hidden constraint. The narrative treats this as a
    standard cryo-ship scenario rather than a catastrophic survival story. NARRATIVE
    STRENGTH: The writing is evocative and emotionally resonant, with strong character
    voice for Voyager-10 and clear thematic stakes. The climactic choice is well-executed.
    However, the incompleteness of constraint integration undermines the full dramatic
    potential of the scenario.'
