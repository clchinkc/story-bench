  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Sensory anchoring strengthened (subway hum in molars, churro
    tang introduced, bass rhythm physicalized). Imani''s voice sharpened from exposition
    to personality (''ghost walks''). VERSION 1→FINAL: Tactile details deepened (calloused
    fingertips, steam on cheeks, cane tapping). Javier''s underestimation crystallized
    in dialogue (''You''re making that up''). Audio clue evolved from plot device
    to structural spine (Morse code in bass gaps). Fun and Games genuinely entertains
    (witty banter, DJ confrontation, hidden room reveal) before darkening (threat
    voicemail, slashed tires, guilt revelation). Blindness consistently portrayed
    as active interpretive strength—Imani isolates echoes, decodes patterns, navigates
    via sound architecture—never as limitation or inspiration-porn. Pacing tightened
    across revisions; exposition minimized. All 5 constraints satisfied: (1) Non-visual
    sensory details prominent throughout (cinnamon-sugar haze, hydraulic fluid tang,
    synthetic sandalwood, bass vibrations in molars); (2) Blindness respected and
    strength-based (audio analysis, spatial reasoning, threat detection); (3) Audio
    clue crucial (bass track→Morse code→evidence); (4) Javier initially skeptical
    (''You''re making that up,'' ''glaring like I''m here to steal napkins''); (5)
    Fun and Games entertains before turning dark (club banter, hidden room discovery,
    then threat escalation). Minor weaknesses: ''bat'' comparison borders on cliché
    (though contextually justified); final paragraph''s ''one note at a time'' slightly
    overwrought. Beat execution strong: Catalyst clear, Fun and Games has genuine
    momentum, Bad Guys Close In raises stakes credibly. Narrative quality elevated
    by specificity and character voice consistency.'
