  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.72): The final output shows selective engagement
    with critique feedback. Critiques identified character_interiority scores ranging
    0.72-0.82, with feedback noting Teddy''s inner life needed deeper specificity
    and less exposition. The final version addresses this partially—the hospital memory
    and Eleanor''s absence are more integrated, but some exposition remains (''He''d
    done this three hundred and sixty-five times a year for forty years''). The revision
    shows awareness of critique but incomplete implementation.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.65): Versions 0-3 appear nearly identical in the provided
    text, suggesting minimal iterative refinement across revisions. The final output
    represents a significant leap from these versions, but the intermediate steps
    are obscured. This creates a discontinuous trajectory rather than demonstrable
    incremental improvement. The jump to the final version is substantial but lacks
    visible revision process.


    PRESERVATION (0.78): Core strengths from critiques are maintained—the coffee cup
    ritual, the specific time (5:47), the sidewalk cracks, the stone-in-shoe disorientation.
    The opening remains strong. However, some critique-identified strengths (''His
    body was a stranger here'') don''t appear in final output, suggesting selective
    rather than comprehensive preservation.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.92/5 constraints):

    1. ✓ Teddy''s routine with loving detail: Excellent execution—5:47 wake time,
    Eleanor''s mug, specific route, cracks in sidewalk, Mrs. Henderson''s cookies,
    exact weight since 1987.

    2. ✓ Disruption reveals avoidance: Orange barrels force route change; reveals
    Teddy has been avoiding genuine connection, emotional expression, and living beyond
    ritual.

    3. ✓ Neighbor story intersects: Margaret Chen''s subplot is well-integrated—her
    mother''s death mirrors Eleanor''s, her garden parallels his stasis, creates meaningful
    intersection.

    4. ✓ Late wife present through absence: Eleanor''s absence permeates—the unwashed
    mug, unsaid words, hospital silence, the final emptying of the cup as release.

    5. ✓ New path offers what old couldn''t: The unfamiliar street leads to Margaret,
    to genuine human connection, to tasting life (literal tomato), to emotional honesty
    Eleanor''s memory demands.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.85): Story Circle beats are present and functional:

    - You: Teddy in routine (strong)

    - Need: Disruption forces choice (clear)

    - Go: Takes unfamiliar street (executed)

    - Search: Walks lost, encounters Margaret (effective)

    - Find: Tomato, connection, understanding (resonant)

    - Take: Empties Eleanor''s cup, commits to return (satisfying)

    - Return: Implied future with Margaret (adequate)

    - Changed: Moves from stasis to openness (demonstrated)

    Minor weakness: ''Return'' beat is implied rather than shown; ''Changed'' could
    be more explicit.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.88): Prose is strong throughout. Specific strengths: the
    coffee cup opening, the numerical weight of 14,600 mornings, Margaret''s garden
    as visual metaphor, the tomato scene''s sensory richness and emotional resonance.
    The final paragraph (''quiet space where waiting used to live'') is particularly
    effective. Weaknesses: occasional exposition (''He''d been the one who watched
    her feel things''), some telling rather than showing in middle section. The ending
    balances closure with openness well.


    OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The final output is a strong, constraint-satisfying story
    with good narrative quality and emotional resonance. The critique responsiveness
    is moderate—some feedback was incorporated but not comprehensively. The improvement
    trajectory is unclear due to version presentation. The story succeeds most in
    constraint satisfaction and narrative execution, with minor gaps in beat clarity
    and critique integration.'
