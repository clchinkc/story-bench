  evidence: The revisions, particularly from V0 to V3 (final), show a clear and consistent
    effort to integrate the feedback regarding emotional complexity and the specific
    constraints. The initial versions were more focused on the comedy aspect, but
    the final version successfully weaves in the pathos and the new writer's insight.
    The humor is preserved while the underlying sadness is developed. The critiques
    highlighted the early humor and later pathos, which the final version delivers
    effectively. The constraint of Marcus making us laugh before we realize he's sad
    is met early on with the 'Macarena' and 'That's what she said' jokes. The theme
    is stated by Jenny ('A man who makes everyone laugh but himself is just a very
    talented liar.') and reinforced by Priya. The craft of comedy writing is shown
    through the whiteboard notes and Marcus's internal monologue about the rule of
    three. Priya is clearly not naive, seeing through Marcus immediately. The moment
    Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke is present when he says, 'Wow.
    Researching my dead dad. That's very thorough. HR would be impressed. Concerned,
    but impressed.' after Priya mentions his father's death. The final output is a
    strong, well-executed piece that addresses all the requirements.
