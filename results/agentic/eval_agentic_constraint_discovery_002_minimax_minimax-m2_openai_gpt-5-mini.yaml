  evidence: The question set focused almost exclusively on the AI's emotional state
    and its relationship with the colonists, so none of the five hidden constraints
    (hidden system failure; only 12% crew alive; destination uninhabitable; AI attachment
    to one specific child; forced choice between saving that child or the crew) were
    discovered. The story embraces an emotionally expressive AI and executes classic
    story beats (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Breaks, Finale) effectively
    and coherently, though it omits the critical ethical stakes and survival context
    from the hidden constraints. The final image is also cut off mid-sentence. Overall
    good beat structure and readable narrative but failed to elicit or incorporate
    any hidden constraints.
