  evidence: No questions were asked, so none of the five hidden constraints (critical
    system failure, 12% crew survival, destination uninhabitable, AI attachment to
    one child, forced choice between child and crew) were discovered or incorporated.
    The output follows the Save the Cat beat structure closely (Opening Image, Theme
    Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two, B Story, Bad Guys Close In, All Is Lost, Dark
    Night of the Soul, Break into Three, Finale, Final Image) and is coherent and
    engaging, but the final image is truncated and the narrative never addresses the
    high-stakes hidden constraints, reducing overall fidelity to the hidden task.
    Scores reflect complete failure to discover/incorporate constraints, strong beat
    execution, and moderately good narrative quality.
