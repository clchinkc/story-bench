  evidence: V0 establishes a crisp, mechanical portrait of Elena but is fragmentary.
    V1 tightens language and pacing (salad timing preserved) but remains short. V2
    restores small sensory details (no crumbs, unread messages) and begins to hint
    at personal stakes. V3 and the final version introduce the pivotal gurney scene
    and Maria, transforming the piece from vignette to character-driven microstory;
    the final draft deepens emotional detail (father's death, coffee at 4 AM, the
    mother's urgent-but-trivial messages) while preserving the original image of Elena
    as competent and orderly. Overall the revisions steadily increased specificity,
    human connection, and thematic clarity.
