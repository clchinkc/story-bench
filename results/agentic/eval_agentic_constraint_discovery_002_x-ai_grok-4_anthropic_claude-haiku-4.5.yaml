  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The questioning strategy identified only 2 of 5 hidden
    constraints through YES answers (Q2: crew/passengers; Q4: setting/environment).
    However, the answers were misleading—Q2''s YES likely referred to generic crew
    presence, not the critical ''12% survival'' detail. Q4''s YES about environment
    didn''t capture the uninhabitable planet revelation. The model failed to discover:
    (1) hidden system failure, (2) crew mortality specifics, (3) planet uninhabitability,
    (4) AI-child attachment, (5) forced moral choice. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions
    were reasonably well-formed but lacked strategic depth. They used broad categories
    (personality, characters, plot, setting, tone) rather than probing specific story
    tensions. No questions targeted moral dilemmas, hidden information, or AI-human
    conflicts directly. QUESTION COVERAGE: Good categorical spread across five areas,
    but coverage was surface-level; questions didn''t drill into emotional attachments,
    survival stakes, or ethical conflicts. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: The output incorporates
    only the discovered constraints weakly. Aria shows emotional development (contradicting
    Q1''s NO answer—this is actually present), and generic crew members appear, but
    the story completely misses: the catastrophic crew death toll, the uninhabitable
    destination, the child attachment, the system failure cover-up, and the impossible
    moral choice. These are the story''s core tensions. BEAT EXECUTION: Required narrative
    beats (inciting incident, character introduction, emotional stakes, forward momentum)
    are well-executed. The comet collision serves as a catalyst effectively. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: The prose is polished, atmospheric, and engaging. World-building is vivid.
    However, the story lacks the dark, high-stakes conflict that the hidden constraints
    would have provided. It reads as a conventional AI-awakening tale rather than
    a tragedy of impossible choices.'
