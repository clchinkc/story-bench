  evidence: None of the five hidden constraints were directly probed by the questions
    (mentor death, no direct magic use, three-day limit, father-as-failed-hero, reforging
    ancestral sword). The asked questions were reasonable about mentor status, nature
    of the darkness, family involvement, magical forge, and artifact/prophecy, but
    they missed key temporal, fatality, and mechanics constraints. The story is coherent
    and includes the labeled beats (Call, Crossing, Ordeal) and a cursed artifact/prophecy,
    but fails to incorporate the mentor's death, the three-day urgency, the requirement
    to reforge an ancestral sword, and the explicit father-as-failed-hero element;
    protagonist also acts in a way that sidesteps the 'no direct magic' constraint
    (ambiguous). Overall decent narration but poor constraint discovery and incorporation.
