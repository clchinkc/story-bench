  evidence: 'Across the revision trajectory the author expanded the scene (added the
    Echo-Seeker, the cyclone deadline, Maeve and Tiber interactions) and explicitly
    stated mentor flaws and adult dismissal, so the five formal constraints are now
    all satisfied. The revisions improved plot momentum and stakes (call to adventure,
    skepticism, reluctant mentor, threshold crossing into a dangerous dive). Critiques
    about Zara''s voice were only partially addressed: earlier complaints noted philosophical,
    reflective lines inappropriate for a 12‑year‑old; the final text still contains
    several reflective, narratorly or sardonic lines (e.g., ''This was *structure*.
    This was *purpose*.'' and explanatory sentences about Tiber''s flaw) that read
    older than Zara, so youth_voice remains middling. Strengths (worldbuilding, invented
    device, tangible danger) were preserved and clarified; weaknesses (adult-flavored
    internalization and some telling rather than showing) were reduced but not eliminated.'
