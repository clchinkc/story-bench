  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer systematically addressed feedback
    across revisions. Early critiques highlighted emotional complexity and the need
    for genuine laughter before pathos—the final output opens with the sentient cake
    joke landing hard (''The room erupted in genuine laughter'') before revealing
    Marcus''s hollow observation. The coffee machine scene directly responds to critique
    notes about showing Marcus ''almost breaking''—his reflection in stainless steel,
    the fissure opening, then the mask sliding back with ''killer button'' is precisely
    calibrated vulnerability-and-cover. IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0→V1 shows minimal
    changes; V2 adds sitcom context (''Heavy Petting, a sitcom about a dysfunctional
    dog hotel''), grounding the industry authenticity. V3→Final represents the most
    significant leap: the coffee machine scene is expanded with visceral detail (''knuckles
    white on the counter,'' ''fissure open,'' ''mask slid back''), and the ending
    shifts from Marcus deflecting to Marcus genuinely asking Chloe''s version and
    sitting with quiet truth. This demonstrates clear progression toward emotional
    depth. PRESERVATION: Strengths from early versions (the sentient cake joke, Ben''s
    theme statement, Chloe''s clear-eyed assessment) are maintained throughout. The
    whiteboard as visual anchor persists. The writers'' room atmosphere (stale Chinese
    food, exhaustion) remains consistent. New elements (the garage scene reference,
    the coffee machine moment, the final non-joke) enhance rather than replace. CONSTRAINT
    SATISFACTION: (1) Laugh before sadness—✓ Sentient cake joke lands first, then
    ''Marcus watched it dissipate, a technician observing a successful test. The hollow
    in his chest echoed.'' (2) Theme by minor character—✓ Ben states it: ''When do
    we get to the joke that''s just… quiet? The one that hurts because it''s true?''
    (3) Comedy craft specificity—✓ Detailed breakdown of Rule of Three, visual puns,
    the ''topping'' concept, the garage scene callback. (4) New writer sees through
    Marcus—✓ Chloe reads his grief (''You wrote that after your dad died, right?''),
    sees the crack in his reflection, and the final line confirms ''Chloe saw. She
    didn''t call him on it.'' (5) Almost-break moment with joke cover—✓ Coffee machine
    scene: face ''utterly, nakedly bereft,'' then ''wry smile plastered over the crack,''
    then ''killer button'' joke. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening Hook (writers'' room desperation)—strong.
    Inciting Incident (Chloe arrives, assesses Marcus)—clear. Theme Stated (Ben''s
    quiet-joke observation)—properly placed. B-story break (neighbor/sugar)—functional.
    Midpoint (coffee machine revelation)—emotionally pivotal. All-is-Lost (Marcus
    retreats into formula, ''taste like ash'')—well-executed. Dark Night (alone, erasing
    board)—contemplative. Break into Three (Chloe returns)—catalyst for change. Finale
    (Marcus asks genuine question, sits with truth)—earned and quiet. NARRATIVE QUALITY:
    The prose balances specificity with restraint. Metaphors work (''technician observing
    a successful test,'' ''scalpel,'' ''boarded up years ago''). Dialogue reveals
    character without exposition. The final image—leaving words on the whiteboard,
    meeting Chloe''s gaze, not joking—is a powerful subversion of the opening''s formula-driven
    energy. The story demonstrates understanding of comedy writing craft while interrogating
    its emotional cost. Minor weakness: the neighbor/catapult tangent slightly disrupts
    pacing, though it serves thematic purpose (Marcus retreating into absurdity).
    Overall, this is a sophisticated piece that satisfies all constraints while achieving
    genuine emotional resonance.'
