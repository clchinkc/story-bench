  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions. Version 0 was a barebones
    start. Version 1 introduced key elements like the flyer and initial internal conflict.
    Version 2 refined the language and added more sensory details. Version 3 further
    polished the opening and set the stage for the full narrative. The final output
    successfully integrated all constraints and delivered a compelling story. The
    internal conflict is shown through Mateo's actions and thoughts (e.g., 'Sparks
    fired in Mateo’s brain, then fizzled beneath AP Physics problems and the overdue
    electric bill'). The grandmother moment is specific and impactful, crystallizing
    his choice. Mr. Sánchez and Abuela both genuinely understand his dilemma, offering
    different but supportive perspectives. Cultural elements like 'El Sol Market,'
    'Abuela’s Lantus,' 'Lirio’s Diner,' 'dried ancho chiles,' 'Pine-Sol,' 'comal,'
    'norteño music,' 'nopales,' 'creosote,' 'frijoles,' and the Spanglish dialogue
    feel authentic and integrated. The resolution is earned through Mateo's internal
    struggle, the wisdom shared by Abuela, and his subsequent actions, showing growth
    rather than a simple choice.
