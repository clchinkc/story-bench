  evidence: 'Version 0 was a truncated setup focused on Elena''s competence. Versions
    1 and 2 made minor wording adjustments but remained incomplete. Version 3 introduced
    the seed of a flaw but was still fragmentary. The final output resolves the trajectory:
    it preserves the original, repeated motif of Elena as a ''conductor'' and her
    operational competence, then explicitly introduces her loneliness, develops a
    believable friendship with Mia through repeated coffees and shared confidences,
    includes a concrete medical detail (directing the use of epinephrine during an
    allergic reaction) that advances the action, and ends on an ambiguous note about
    whether Elena has truly changed. Overall the quality moved from an incomplete
    scene to a cohesive short piece that meets the stated constraints; beats are well
    executed though some moments lean slightly toward telling rather than fully showing
    (hence beat_execution 0.9 and narrative_quality 0.8).'
