  evidence: 'Plan: includes key beats (Opening, Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two,
    False Lead, Unconventional Technique, Midpoint) and specific elements (symbol,
    rain-pattern profiling, suspect), but did not explicitly note the secondary-character
    betrayal or a ticking-clock in the written plan, so plan completeness is moderate
    (0.6). Specificity is good (0.8) due to concrete clues and techniques. Final output
    adherence is high (0.9): the story follows the plan closely and also supplies
    the missing betrayal and a clear ticking-clock. All six constraints are satisfied
    in the final output (false lead; unconventional profiling; ticking clock; betrayal
    by Sarah; non-physical midpoint confrontation with Agent Thompson; explicit confrontation
    of Marcus''s past failure). All four required beats (Catalyst, Debate, Break into
    Two, Midpoint) are present and executed. Narrative quality is strong (0.8): coherent,
    good tension and pacing, though the piece is brief and could deepen character
    emotions and stakes further.'
