  evidence: 'Version 0 is almost entirely logistical description (bullet-train metaphor,
    supply-chain hiccup). Version 1 preserves the logistics but adds Elena''s name
    and the 0.9% sodium chloride detail and some metaphorical framing (central nervous
    system). Version 2 begins to open the interior life but is truncated. Version
    3 and the Final output complete the arc: the hospital competence is established
    up front (diverting post-ops, sourcing saline, authorizing overtime), then the
    scene shifts to Elena''s quiet office and the waiting-room interaction with Arthur
    (COPD exacerbation, fractured wrist, nebulizer) that reveals emotional vulnerability.
    The final revision preserves earlier strengths (medical details, efficiency imagery)
    while adding a clearly internal moment and an ambiguous ending. The one shortfall:
    the prompt required a genuine, earned friendship; the piece instead shows a brief,
    sincere human connection with Arthur rather than a developed friendship, so that
    constraint is not fully met.'
