  evidence: 'Quality improves steadily across revisions. V0 is a skeletal scene-setting
    with hints of conflict but little specificity. V1 introduces Mateo''s obligations
    and the robotics flyer, anchoring stakes. V2 deepens sensory detail and cultural
    markers (swamp cooler, dried chiles, Lantus) and begins to show internal friction.
    V3 refines pacing and emotional beats. The final version completes the arc: the
    cooler break, Mom rehearsing English, the flyer’s pull, the specific Abuela scene
    (thorn, blood, cactus metaphor, keys) that crystallizes his choice, his attendance
    at orientation, and a morning that shows the earned resolution. Core elements
    (setting, obligations, flyer, Abuela, robotics) are preserved and expanded; the
    revisions respond directly to the constraints by turning telling into concrete
    action and dialogue, adding an adult (Abuela) who truly understands, and making
    cultural detail feel lived-in rather than performative.'
