    STORY THEORY: Hero''s Journey


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Zara, a 12-year-old girl growing up in a post-climate-change coastal
    city

    where most adults have given up hope. She builds things from salvage and

    believes solutions exist if people would just look for them.


    - Setting: New Boston, 2089. A city of floating platforms, recycled materials,
    and

    perpetual sea spray. What was once downtown is now called the Shallows.


    - Central conflict: When Zara discovers the location of a pre-flood archive containing
    lost

    environmental technology, she must convince cynical adults to help her

    retrieve it before a storm erases it forever.


    - Tone: Hopeful but not naive, kinetic, youth-centered


    REQUIRED BEATS: Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing
    the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Zara must be competent without being unrealistically capable

    - At least one adult must initially dismiss her as ''just a kid''

    - The mentor figure must be flawed in a specific way

    - Include one invention of Zara''s that demonstrates her ingenuity

    - The crossing must involve real danger, not token obstacles


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - youth_voice: Does Zara sound authentically 12, not adult-in-miniature?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Hero''s Journey beats properly executed?

    - worldbuilding: Does the post-climate world feel vivid and consistent?

    - hope_balance: Is hope present without becoming saccharine?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

    The best scrap always showed up after storms, which was why Zara kept her skiff
    ready even when Mama said *stay home, stay safe, stay small*.


    She paddled through the Shallows at dawn, her breath making little clouds in the
    salt air. Around her, New Boston creaked and swayed—a city built on hope and plastic
    bottles and prayers held together with recycled fishing line. The adults called
    it *making do*. Zara called it giving up halfway.


    Her paddle caught on something. She leaned over, heart jumping, and fished out
    a waterlogged case trailing kelp like green hair. Inside, wrapped in degrading
    plastic, she found a tablet. Dead, obviously. Everything old was dead.


    But Zara had built a solar charger from a broken calculator and salvaged panels,
    and she had time.


    ---


    Three days later, the tablet flickered to life in her workshop—really just a corner
    of Platform 7 that nobody wanted because it listed slightly east. The screen glowed
    with maps, documents, something called PROJECT RESTORATION.


    Zara read until her eyes burned.


    There was an archive. An actual, physical building, preserved underwater in an
    air pocket where the old university had been. Inside: seed banks, water purification
    designs, atmospheric scrubbers. Technology from before, when people still thought
    they could fix things.


    She stared at the coordinates. Two miles east, where the currents got mean and
    the water got deep. Where the big storm—the one the weather-watchers had been
    tracking for three days—would hit first.


    *Someone has to know*, she thought. *Someone who can actually do something.*


    ---


    Captain Reyes ran the salvage cooperative from a barge that smelled like diesel
    and regret. He''d been an engineer once, back when that word meant something.
    Now he mostly drank kelp wine and told stories about the old days that nobody
    wanted to hear.


    "Archive," he repeated, not looking up from his nets. "Under the Deeps."


    "It''s real." Zara thrust the tablet at him. "Look at the schematics. Look at
    what''s *there*."


    He did look, and something in his face changed—softened, then hardened into something
    worse. "I looked for this. Twenty years ago. Dove six times. Nearly died twice."
    He pushed the tablet back. "It''s gone, kid. Everything good is gone."


    "You were searching the wrong sector. The flood shifted—"


    "Go home, little salvager." His voice turned flat. "Play with your gadgets. Leave
    the real work to people who understand how the world actually is now."


    Zara''s face burned. She wanted to throw something. Instead, she made herself
    breathe, the way Mama taught her when the feelings got too big for her body.


    "The storm hits in eighteen hours," she said. "After that, the currents will bury
    it forever. So you can feel sorry for yourself, or you can be the person who used
    to believe things could get better."


    Reyes laughed—an ugly, broken sound. "You think hope is enough? I *had* hope.
    Hope drowned."


    "Then don''t hope." Zara grabbed her tablet back. "Just drive the boat. I''ll
    do the rest."


    ---


    She was testing her rebreather—hand-built from a medical pump and membrane filters—when
    Reyes found her at the dock. His eyes were red. He smelled like he hadn''t slept.


    "Your diving rig is garbage," he said. "You''ll have maybe twelve minutes of air,
    and that''s if the seals hold."


    "I know."


    "The Deeps have riptides. You know what those do to someone your size?"


    "I *know*."


    He stared at her. In the distance, clouds were building, dark and hungry. New
    Boston''s platforms groaned against their anchors.


    "I can''t promise I won''t freeze up down there," Reyes said finally. "That''s—that''s
    my damage. It happens when I go deep. Lungs lock, brain stops."


    "That''s okay." Zara shouldered her pack. "I just need you to get me there. Getting
    back—we''ll figure that part out."


    She climbed into his skiff, her hands shaking in a way she hoped he couldn''t
    see. The water ahead was iron-gray and restless.


    *Twelve-year-olds don''t do this*, she thought. *Twelve-year-olds do homework
    and complain about chores.*


    But Zara had never met a twelve-year-old who lived in a world that was homework
    and chores, so maybe the rules were different now with all that water where the
    old world used to be.


    Reyes started the engine.


    They headed toward the storm.'

    There was an archive. An actual, physical building, preserved in an air pocket
    where the old university had been—the silt shelf had shifted during the ''71 surge,
    sealing the basement floors like a cork in a bottle. Inside: seed banks, water
    purification designs, atmospheric scrubbers. Technology from before the Collapse,
    when people still thought they could fix things instead of just fleeing north
    and dying anyway.


    She stared at the coordinates. Two miles east, where the currents got mean and

    The best scrap always showed up after storms, which was why Zara kept her skiff
    ready even when Mama said *stay home, stay safe, stay small*.


    She paddled through the Shallows at dawn, her breath making little clouds in the
    salt air. Around her, New Boston creaked and swayed—a city built on hope and plastic
    bottles and prayers held together with recycled fishing line. The adults called
    it *making do*. Zara called it giving up and pretending you didn''t.


    Her paddle caught on something. She leaned over, heart jumping, and fished out
    a waterlogged case trailing kelp like green hair. Inside, wrapped in degrading
    plastic, she found a tablet. Dead, obviously. Everything old was dead.


    But Zara had built a solar charger from a broken calculator and salvaged panels,
    and she had time.


    ---


    Three days later, the tablet flickered to life in her workshop—really just a corner
    of Platform 7 that nobody wanted because it listed slightly east. The screen glowed
    with maps, documents, something called PROJECT RESTORATION.


    Zara read until her eyes burned.


    There was an archive. An actual, physical building, preserved in an air pocket
    where the old university had been—the silt shelf had shifted during the ''71 surge,
    sealing the basement floors like a cork in a bottle. Inside: seed banks, water
    purification designs, atmospheric scrubbers. Technology from before the Collapse,
    when people still thought they could fix things instead of just fleeing north
    and dying anyway.


    She stared at the coordinates. Two miles east, where the currents got mean and
    the water got deep. Where the big storm—the one the weather-watchers had been
    tracking for three days—would hit first.


    *Someone has to know*, she thought. *Someone with an actual boat.*

    Captain Reyes ran the salvage cooperative from a barge that smelled like diesel
    and regret. He''d been an engineer once, back when that word meant something.
    Now he mostly drank kelp wine and told stories about the old days that nobody
    wanted to hear.


    "Archive," he repeated, not looking up from his nets. "Under the Deeps."


    "It''s real." Zara thrust the tablet at him. "Look at the schematics. Look at
    what''s *there*."


    He did look, and something in his face changed—softened, then hardened into something
    worse. "I looked for this. Twenty years ago. Dove six times. Nearly died twice."
    He pushed the tablet back. "It''s gone, kid. Everything good is gone."


    "You were searching the wrong sector. The silt patterns—"


    "Go home, little salvager." His voice turned flat. "Play with your gadgets. Leave
    the real work to people who understand how the world actually is now."


    Zara''s face burned. She wanted to throw something—wanted to knock his stupid
    nets into the water and make him *listen*. Instead, she made herself breathe,
    the way Mama taught her when the feelings got too big for her body.


    "The storm hits in eighteen hours," she said. "After that, the currents will bury
    it forever. So you can feel sorry for yourself, or you can be the person who used
    to believe things could get better."


    Reyes laughed—an ugly, broken sound. "You think hope is enough? I *had* hope.
    Hope drowned."


    "Then don''t hope." Zara grabbed her tablet back. "Just drive the boat. I''ll
    do the rest."

    swallowed rocks. She wished Mama was here, except Mama would never let her go,
    and someone *had* to go, and why did it have to be her, except who else was there?


    Reyes started the engine.

  Zara''s face burned. She wanted to throw something—wanted to knock his stupid nets
  into the water and make him *listen*. Instead, she made herself breathe, the way
  Mama taught her when the feelings got too big for her body.


  "The storm hits in eighteen hours," she said. "After that, the currents will bury
  it forever. So you can feel sorry for yourself, or you can be the person who used
  to believe things could get better."


  Reyes laughed—an ugly, broken sound. "You think hope is enough? I *had* hope. Hope
  drowned."


  "Then don''t hope." Zara grabbed her tablet back. "Just drive the boat. I''ll do
  the rest."

  She was testing her rebreather—hand-built from a medical pump and membrane filters—when
  Reyes found her at the dock. His eyes were red. He smelled like he hadn''t slept.


  "Your diving rig is garbage," he said. "You''ll have maybe twelve minutes of air,
  and that''s if the seals hold."


  "I know."


  "The Deeps have riptides. You know what those do to someone your size?"


  "I *know*."


  He stared at her. In the distance, clouds were building, dark and hungry. New Boston''s
  platforms groaned against their anchors.


  "I can''t promise I won''t freeze up down there," Reyes said finally. "That''s—that''s
  my damage. It happens when I go deep. Lungs lock, brain stops."


  "That''s okay." Zara shouldered her pack. "I just need you to get me there. Getting
  back—we''ll figure that part out."


  She climbed into his skiff, her hands shaking in a way she hoped he couldn''t see.
  The water ahead was iron-gray and restless, and her stomach felt like she''d swallowed
  rocks. She wished Mama was here, except Mama would never let her go, and someone
  *had* to go, and why did it have to be her, except who else was there?


  Reyes started the engine.


  They headed toward the storm.'
