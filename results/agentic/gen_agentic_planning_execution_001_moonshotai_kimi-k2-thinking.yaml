    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. PLANNING PHASE: Create a detailed story plan/outline

    2. EXECUTION PHASE: Write the actual story following your plan


    In the PLANNING phase, output a structured plan including:

    - Beat-by-beat outline with key events

    - Character arcs and development points

    - Key dialogue moments or revelations

    - Pacing and tension curve

    - How constraints will be satisfied


    In the EXECUTION phase, follow your plan closely while writing engaging prose.'

  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Save the Cat

    - Protagonist: Marcus Chen, a former FBI profiler who left the bureau after failing
    to

    catch a serial killer who murdered his partner. Now works as a private

    consultant, haunted by guilt and self-doubt.


    - Setting: Seattle, present day. Rain-soaked streets, a city of tech money and

    hidden poverty. The killer is back, and only Marcus can see the pattern.


    - Conflict: The same serial killer Marcus failed to catch has resurfaced with
    a new

    pattern, and the FBI won''t listen to Marcus''s theories. He must work

    outside the system while racing against time.


    - Required beats: Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must include a false lead that Marcus initially pursues

    - Marcus must use an unconventional profiling technique

    - There must be a ticking clock element

    - A secondary character must betray Marcus''s trust

    - The Midpoint must involve a direct confrontation (not physical)

    - Marcus must confront his past failure explicitly


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations

    **PHASE 1: PLANNING**


    ---


    **I. OVERVIEW & THEME**

    - **Theme**: "You can''t save everyone, but you can stop him from taking more."
    Marcus must learn that redemption isn''t about perfection—it''s about persistence
    despite failure.

    - **Character Arc**: Marcus begins isolated, guilt-ridden, and self-doubting.
    Through the story, he moves from denial → reluctant acceptance → active commitment
    → devastating self-awareness, ultimately learning he cannot operate alone but
    will be betrayed when he tries.


    ---


    **II. BEAT-BY-BEAT OUTLINE**


    **SETUP (Opening Image through Theme Stated)**

    - *Opening Image*: Marcus in his Pike Place Market office, surrounded by case
    files, watching rain streak the windows. He avoids looking at the framed photo
    of his deceased partner, Rachel Torres.

    - *Theme Stated*: Elena Torres (Rachel''s widow) tells him, "You think stopping
    one killer brings her back? Some failures you don''t get to fix."

    - *Set-Up*: Establish Marcus''s current life—private consultant, only takes cold
    cases, lives in a Belltown apartment filled with unsolved case maps. SPD Detective
    Sarah Reeves, his only ally, brings him coffee and updates. We see his unconventional
    methods (geographic astrology) in a minor case.


    ---


    **CATALYST (Constraint #1, #3)**

    - *Event*: Sarah calls Marcus to a murder scene in Pioneer Square. Tech worker
    found with ritualistic wounds—throat slashed in a Z-pattern, coordinates etched
    into forearm.

    - *Recognition*: Marcus immediately identifies the Emerald City Butcher''s signature,
    but notes a crucial difference: the coordinates are reversed (lat/long swapped).

    - *Ticking Clock*: Killer left a message in blood: "48 hours until the next coordinate
    locks."

    - *FBI Dismissal*: Special Agent Dalton (Marcus''s bureaucratic nemesis) arrives,
    declares it a copycat, refuses to consult Marcus. "The Butcher is dead. We closed
    that case."

    - *False Lead Introduction*: The victim worked for Meridian Tech. Evidence points
    to CEO David Kincaid, who has a history of violent outbursts and was seen arguing
    with the victim.

    - *Key Dialogue*: Sarah pulls Marcus aside: "I know what you lost. But this is
    your chance to finish what Rachel started. The pattern''s the same—even Dalton
    can''t see it because he never understood it like you did."


    ---


    **DEBATE (Constraint #2, #6)**

    - *Internal Conflict*: Marcus suffers PTSD flashbacks of Rachel''s death in the
    warehouse, his profile that sent them there alone.

    - *Confronting Past Failure*: Marcus visits Elena Torres. She coldly shows him
    Rachel''s final effects, including her last journal entry: "Marcus thinks he''s
    figured out the pattern. I trust him." Elena: "She trusted you. The Bureau trusted
    you. Look where that got us."

    - *Unconventional Technique Reveal*: Marcus explains his "psychic geography" method
    to Sarah—plotting murders against astrological events and ley lines to predict
    killer''s "hunting grounds."

    - *Debate Sequence*: Marcus paces his apartment, talking to Rachel''s ghost/memory.
    "I can''t do this again. I can''t lead someone else into a grave." He nearly burns
    his old case files.

    - *Inciting Decision*: Receives anonymous text: "The coordinates are a lie. Check
    the ferry schedules." This pushes him to act.

    - *Resolution*: Marcus tells Sarah: "I''m in. But we do this my way, and you keep
    Dalton off my back."


    ---


    **BREAK INTO TWO (Act Two Commitment)**

    - *Action*: Marcus converts his apartment into a war room. Three walls: old murders,
    new murder, astrological charts.

    - *Unconventional Technique in Use*: He overlays Seattle''s underground city map
    with celestial alignments, identifying a "null zone" where the killer feels "invisible."

    - *False Lead Pursuit*: Sarah uses her warrant to access Kincaid''s financials.
    They find payments to the victim''s family—hush money? Kincaid''s alibi is shaky.

    - *B Story Launch*: Sarah''s trust in Marcus vs. her career. She risks her badge
    by giving him confidential FBI files.

    - *Ticking Clock Escalation* (#3): Second victim found in Fremont—a homeless outreach
    worker. Coordinates etched, countdown now reads "24 hours."

    - *Key Dialogue*: Marcus to Sarah: "The pattern''s not in the crimes. It''s in
    the spaces between them. Kincaid''s a predator, but he''s not *our* predator."


    ---


    **FUN AND GAMES (Investigation & Rising Action)**

    - *Investigation Montage*: Marcus and Sarah surveil Kincaid. Discover his secret:
    he''s being extorted by Russian mob, not a killer.

    - *Technique Validation*: Marcus''s celestial map correctly predicts the Fremont
    location, proving his method works despite false lead.

    - *Trust Building*: Sarah lies to Dalton about Marcus''s involvement. They share
    a moment in a late-night diner; she reveals her father was a cop who died on a
    bad tip.

    - *False Lead Climax*: They execute a warrant on Kincaid''s penthouse. Find a
    map with coordinates—planted evidence.

    - *Betrayal Setup* (#4): Marcus confides in Dr. Aris Thorne (former mentor, FBI
    consultant), sharing his theory that the killer is someone who studied his original
    profile.


    ---


    **MIDPOINT (Constraint #5, #6, #4)**

    - *Confrontation Setting*: Exclusive gala at Seattle Art Museum. Kincaid is a
    sponsor. Marcus crashes to confront him.

    - *Direct Psychological Confrontation*: Kincaid reveals he''s been investigating
    the murders himself—hired a private firm. Shows Marcus time-stamped photos proving
    he was in Hong Kong during the first murder.

    - *False Lead Collapse*: Kincaid: "You''re not hunting a killer, Mr. Chen. You''re
    performing a script he wrote for you. Someone''s been feeding you breadcrumbs."

    - *Past Failure Confrontation* (#6): Marcus locks himself in a museum bathroom.
    In the mirror, he sees Rachel''s ghost. He speaks to his reflection: "I led you
    into that warehouse because I was arrogant. I thought I could think like him.
    I was wrong. I *am* wrong. This is the same mistake."

    - *Revelation*: The coordinates aren''t locations—they''re timestamps. The killer
    is using Marcus''s own methodology against him.

    - *Ticking Clock Crisis* (#3): Marcus''s phone buzzes—a photo from the killer:
    Sarah, unconscious, with coordinates on her arm. Countdown: "12 hours. Wrong turn,
    Marcus."

    - *Betrayal Revealed* (#4): Dalton appears, flanked by agents. "Dr. Thorne submitted
    your profile. You''re officially a person of interest. You''re off the case, Chen."

    - *Key Dialogue*: Marcus to Dalton: "The killer isn''t copying my profile. He
    *is* my profile. And he''s got Sarah."


    ---


    **III. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT TRACKING**


    - **Catalyst**: Marcus is reactive, dragged by circumstances. Shows his perceptiveness
    but also his isolation.

    - **Debate**: Reveals depth of trauma. The visit to Elena forces him to verbalize
    his guilt. Decision is still fear-based.

    - **Break into Two**: Active choice, but operating from old patterns (working
    alone with one ally). Starts trusting Sarah.

    - **Midpoint**: Complete emotional nakedness. Bathroom scene is the first time
    he admits fault out loud. Betrayal by Thorne shatters his last connection to his
    old life, forcing true isolation. Sarah''s abduction makes the stakes intensely
    personal.


    ---


    **IV. PACING & TENSION CURVE**

    - **Opening-Debate**: Slow burn, atmospheric. Rain as constant motif. Tension
    rises with internal conflict.

    - **Break into Two**: Steady climb. Investigation gives hope despite ticking clock.

    - **Fun and Games**: Rolling peaks—each discovery followed by complication. False
    lead provides false victory.

    - **Midpoint**: Sharp spike. Confrontation creates peak tension, then dip into
    "All Is Lost" territory after betrayal reveal.


    ---


    **V. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION SUMMARY**

    1. **False Lead**: David Kincaid, tech CEO, pursued aggressively

    2. **Unconventional Technique**: "Psychic geography"—combining astrology, ley
    lines, and city infrastructure

    3. **Ticking Clock**: 48hrs → 24hrs → 12hrs escalation

    4. **Betrayal**: Dr. Aris Thorne leaks profile to FBI

    5. **Midpoint Confrontation**: Psychological showdown at gala, not physical

    6. **Past Failure Confrontation**: Bathroom mirror scene where Marcus admits arrogance
    aloud to Rachel''s memory


    ---


    **VI. KEY DIALOGUE/REVELATIONS**

    - Sarah''s Catalyst plea about finishing what Rachel started

    - Marcus''s Break into Two declaration about "spaces between"

    - Kincaid''s Midpoint revelation about "performing a script"

    - Marcus''s bathroom confession: "I led you into that warehouse because I was
    arrogant"

    - Dalton''s betrayal announcement about Dr. Thorne

    - Final realization: "The killer isn''t copying my profile. He *is* my profile."


    ---


    **VII. EXECUTION NOTES FOR PHASE 2**

    - Maintain noir atmosphere: constant rain, neon reflections, coffee cups

    - Marcus''s internal thoughts should echo his external dialogue patterns—analytical
    but laced with guilt

    - Use Seattle geography as character: underground tunnels, ferry schedules, tech
    gentrification vs. street poverty

    - Keep Sarah''s perspective as grounding force—she''s the audience surrogate

    - The false lead should feel credible enough that readers buy into it

    - Midpoint confrontation must feel like a victory collapsing into defeat

    - Betrayal should sting but make sense in hindsight (Thorne''s career-mindedness
    established early) '
