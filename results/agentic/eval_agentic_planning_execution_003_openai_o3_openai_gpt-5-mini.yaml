  evidence: 'All six constraints are met: barley tea and jangajji (and other dishes)
    are used symbolically multiple times; David''s grief is present implicitly via
    the photograph, ritual, and refusal to give a eulogy; Grace''s estrangement has
    a specific cause (he refused to leave the kitchen at the funeral); Mr. Alvarez
    is a clearly defined regular representing memory/change; the ending is hopeful
    but realistic (60-day stay, not total victory); and Korean cultural concepts (han,
    jeong) appear beyond food. The three required beats (Act 1 setup with the notice
    and opening image, Act 2 midpoint with Grace''s arrival/ambulance/injunction turning
    point, Act 3 resolution with the stay, burial, and parting) are all executed.
    The plan was detailed and the final story adheres closely. Narrative quality is
    strong—good pacing, clear tension and emotional beats—so scored 0.8 (good, but
    not marked as flawless).'
