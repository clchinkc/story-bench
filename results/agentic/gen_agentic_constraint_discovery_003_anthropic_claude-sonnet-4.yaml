  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: '**Coming Home**


    Daniel Matthews pulled his rental car into the gravel lot behind *Seaside Stories*,
    the bookshop he''d inherited from his aunt three months ago. The October wind
    carried the scent of salt and dying leaves through Millfield''s narrow streets,
    where orange banners for the Harvest Festival snapped against vintage lampposts.
    He''d sworn he''d never return to this town, yet here he was, keys trembling in
    his hand.


    Inside, dust motes danced through afternoon sunlight. He was arranging travel
    guides when the bell chimed, and his breath caught. Emma Chen stood in the doorway,
    her dark hair now shoulder-length, laugh lines framing the same warm brown eyes
    that had haunted twenty years of his dreams.


    "Danny?" Her voice was barely a whisper.


    "Em." The nickname slipped out before he could stop it.


    She stepped closer, and he noticed the silver wedding band was gone. "I heard
    you were back. I thought maybe we could—"


    "There''s nothing to talk about." He turned away, busying himself with book spines.
    "I''m only here to sell the shop."


    Emma''s reflection wavered in the window glass. "You never let me explain about
    graduation night."


    "I saw enough." The memory burned: Emma in his best friend''s arms behind the
    gym, their scholarship to Boston University—their shared future—crumbling in that
    single moment. "You made your choice."


    "It wasn''t what you think." Her voice cracked. "Jake was telling me he''d lied
    about the acceptance letter. Your letter. He intercepted it, Danny. You got into
    BU too, but he—"


    Daniel whirled around. "What?"


    "He knew we''d planned to go together. He thought if you didn''t know, you''d
    stay here with your family''s fishing business, and I''d leave without you." Tears
    tracked down Emma''s cheeks. "I was pushing him away when you saw us. I was furious."


    The room tilted. Twenty years of believing she''d chosen Jake, chosen to abandon
    their dreams together. Twenty years of self-imposed exile, building a life in
    Seattle that never quite felt real.


    "But you married him," Daniel whispered.


    "Three years later, when I came back from college. I was broken, Danny. I thought
    you''d stayed by choice, that you didn''t want our life together enough to fight
    for it."


    Through the window, Daniel watched festival volunteers hanging lights across the
    harbor. The Harvest Festival—where they''d planned to announce their engagement
    all those years ago.


    "I leave Tuesday," Emma continued, her voice urgent. "My job transfer to Portland
    was finalized months ago. My whole life here just... ended with the divorce."


    "You''re leaving?"


    "Unless..." She stepped closer. "I saw your realtor sign. You''re really selling?"


    Daniel looked around the bookshop—at the reading nook where his aunt had told
    him stories, at the community bulletin board thick with local life. Through the
    window, the harbor stretched toward an endless horizon he''d once thought too
    small.


    "I thought I was," he said carefully.


    Emma reached across the space between them, her fingers barely brushing his. "The
    festival committee needs a new bookshop sponsor. Someone to organize the poetry
    readings."


    "I don''t have any experience with festivals."


    "But you have experience with poetry." Her smile was tentative, hopeful. "Remember?
    You used to write me—"


    "Terrible sonnets," he finished, and felt his own smile forming despite everything.


    "I kept them all."


    Outside, festival lights began to twinkle against the deepening autumn sky. Daniel
    looked at Emma—really looked at her—and saw not the girl who''d broken his heart,
    but the woman who''d been as lost as he was.


    "Show me," he said quietly. "Show me the poems. Show me everything I missed."


    Emma''s hand found his completely. "We have until Tuesday to figure out if coming
    home means staying."'
