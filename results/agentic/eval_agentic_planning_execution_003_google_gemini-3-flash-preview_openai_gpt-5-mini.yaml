  evidence: 'The plan explicitly mapped Act 1/2/3 beats and embedded the constraints
    (mandu and japchae as symbolic foods; Jesa as a Korean cultural element; Mr. Henderson
    as the regular representing the neighborhood; a concrete estrangement cause—missed
    funeral due to internship—and a hopeful but restrained ending). The final output
    follows this closely: eviction/setup with the regular and Chloe’s arrival (Act
    1); the ledgers, the argument and the funeral-miss reveal plus japchae as midpoint
    symbolism (Act 2); the modified Jesa, handing over keys, and a bittersweet hopeful
    departure (Act 3). All six constraints are satisfied. Minor divergences: the regular’s
    exact dish (soondubu) is implied but not named, and the community-loss realization
    is conveyed via permits/wrecking schedule rather than explicit “Sold” signs. Overall
    pacing, tension, and emotional nuance are strong.'
