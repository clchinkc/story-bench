  evidence: 'Initial critiques correctly flagged a missing story (CRITIQUEs 2 and
    3). The author responded by supplying a full excerpt in the final version (clear
    improvement from empty VERSION 0/1/2 to VERSION 3), which addresses the primary
    procedural criticism. Strengths preserved: the opening joke about clown shoes
    and the room’s sensory detail (stale Pad Thai, hum of the AC) remain, and the
    piece shows craft notes (whiteboard beats, writing terms like ''ACT TWO: DISASTER'',
    the act of writing SQUEAK)—these demonstrate an attempt to show comedy-writing
    craft. Remaining issues: two constraints are not satisfied—Lena (the new writer)
    is introduced but we never see her ‘non‑naive’ perspective or her seeing through
    Marcus (line truncates at her introduction), and there is no clear beat where
    Marcus almost breaks and explicitly covers it with a joke (we get emotional numbness
    but not the near-break + joke cover). Save the Cat beats are barely signaled (theme
    stated early by Kevin is present) but the larger beat structure is not developed
    in the excerpt. Overall: notable progress from the missing-text critiques, preserved
    comic voice and some craft-detail, but important constraint and structural beats
    remain unaddressed.'
