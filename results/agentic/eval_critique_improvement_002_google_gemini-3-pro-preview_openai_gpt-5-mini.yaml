  evidence: 'Across versions the piece moved from a primarily gag-driven conference-room
    sketch (V0) to a scene with clear emotional stakes and a more believable writers''
    room. V0 focused on surface jokes (talking dog, monkey gags). V1 introduced a
    stronger opening image and workplace details (fluorescent hum, decomposing staff)
    that grounded the scene. V2/V3 added the key emotional scaffolding: the network
    note delivered by Gary (the theme stated by a minor character), Elena’s blunt-savvy
    entrance and backstory, and the near-break moment where Marcus almost collapses
    but masks it with a joke. These changes respond directly to earlier critiques
    about emotional complexity and constraint fulfillment: the internal life of Marcus
    is amplified (more sensory detail, the memory of the divorce, physiological markers
    of breaking), the craft-of-comedy beats (discussing testing, physical buttons,
    silence as a comedic device) are made explicit, and the new writer is clearly
    not naive. Strengths from earlier drafts — the comic voice and set-piece jokes
    — are preserved while pathos is layered in. Remaining gap: Save the Cat beat structure
    is only partially realized (the scene succeeds as a strong set-piece and character
    moment but does not map fully onto a multi-act beat template), so beat_execution
    is moderate rather than high.'
