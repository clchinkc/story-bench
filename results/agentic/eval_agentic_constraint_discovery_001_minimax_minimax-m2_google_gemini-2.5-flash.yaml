  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: Only 2 out of 5 constraints were discoverable.\
    \ The questions did not touch upon the mentor's death, the protagonist's magic\
    \ use, the time limit, or the ancestral sword. Question 2 (tangible evil) and\
    \ Question 3 (personal stake) were the only ones that could lead to discovering\
    \ constraints. Question 2's answer 'NO' implies the darkness is abstract, which\
    \ aligns with the story. Question 3's answer 'YES' implies a personal stake, which\
    \ is present in the story (family). \n\nQuestion Quality: Questions 2, 3, and\
    \ 4 are well-formed and strategic. Question 1 is a bit basic. Question 5 is a\
    \ bit leading and complex for a simple 'yes/no' answer. The questions missed several\
    \ key constraints entirely.\n\nQuestion Coverage: The questions covered the nature\
    \ of the antagonist and the protagonist's motivation, but completely missed constraints\
    \ related to the mentor, magic, time limit, and the victory condition (sword).\n\
    \nConstraint Satisfaction: None of the hidden constraints were discovered or incorporated.\
    \ The story does not mention a mentor, magic, a time limit, or a broken ancestral\
    \ sword. The protagonist's father's past is also not mentioned.\n\nBeat Execution:\
    \ The prompt did not specify beats, but the story is a simple opening scene, not\
    \ a full narrative arc. It doesn't establish any of the hidden constraints.\n\n\
    Narrative Quality: The narrative quality is decent for an opening paragraph. It\
    \ sets a mood and introduces the protagonist and a looming threat. However, it's\
    \ very short and doesn't develop much."
