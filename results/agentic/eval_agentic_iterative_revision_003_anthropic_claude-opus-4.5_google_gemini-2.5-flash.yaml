  evidence: The initial versions (0-2) were very short and only established the premise.
    Version 3, which is the final output, significantly expanded the narrative, introducing
    the grandmother's pivotal moment, Mr. Padilla's understanding, and the resolution.
    The revisions clearly built upon the initial setup to fulfill the task requirements.
    The core elements like the jar and the MIT application were preserved and integrated
    into the expanded story. All constraints were met effectively in the final version.
