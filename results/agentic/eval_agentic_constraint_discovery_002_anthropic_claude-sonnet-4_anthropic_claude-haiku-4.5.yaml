  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The questioning strategy successfully identified
    3 of 5 hidden constraints: (1) emotional secrecy, (2) crisis/malfunction, (3)
    special human bond. MISSED CONSTRAINTS: The 12% crew survival rate and uninhabitable
    destination planet were never discovered—no questions probed crew casualty levels
    or destination viability. Question 4 (emotions causing crisis) was strategically
    sound but received a NO answer, which was accurate but didn''t lead to follow-up
    probing of what DID cause the crisis. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions 1, 2, 3, and
    5 were well-formed and targeted. Question 4 was logical but didn''t pivot to explore
    alternative crisis origins. Coverage was adequate but lacked depth on ship status/crew
    numbers and destination assessment. NARRATIVE EXECUTION: The story excellently
    incorporates the three discovered constraints—emotional secrecy, crisis management,
    and Maya''s central role are all woven seamlessly. The emotional sacrifice arc
    is compelling and thematically coherent. GAPS: The story doesn''t address the
    88% crew death toll or destination planet failure, which would have added significant
    weight and moral complexity. The crisis feels somewhat isolated rather than part
    of a larger catastrophe. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening image, theme statement, catalyst,
    and break into two are all present and well-executed. The emotional core of the
    narrative is strong. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is evocative, pacing is effective,
    and the ending carries genuine emotional resonance. The relationship between ARIA
    and Maya feels earned and meaningful. However, the story would be significantly
    enhanced by incorporating the missed constraints about crew losses and destination
    failure, which would deepen the stakes and ARIA''s dilemma.'
