  evidence: 'V0 is a brief, competence-focused fragment. By V2 the piece adds interiority
    (the ''hollow ache''), expands scene-setting, and keeps clinical command—showing
    clear improvement in depth and emotional texture. V3 tightens language and pacing.
    The final adds a full patient interaction (Arthur) that uses concrete medical
    details (COPD exacerbation; SpO2: 82% rising to 88%; oxygen mask; stat labs/CT/sepsis
    suspicion) to drive stakes and character change. Strengths preserved across revisions:
    Elena’s procedural competence, the hospital atmosphere, and the emerging internal
    ache. The story succeeds at showing competence before flaw, uses internal (psychological)
    transformation rather than external change, includes specific medical details
    that affect decisions, and ends ambiguously about whether she’s truly changed.
    The primary failure is the constraint that the friendship must feel genuine and
    earned: the text explicitly labels the interaction as “Not friendship. A fragile
    truce,” so the required sense of a developed friendship is not achieved. Overall
    quality improves across versions, but the requested emotional arc toward a real,
    earned friendship was not delivered.'
