  evidence: 'DISCOVERY: All 5 hidden constraints were successfully identified through
    strategic questioning. Q1 captured broken engagement/personal failure. Q2 identified
    romantic interest connected to bookshop. Q3 revealed child relationship (Lila)
    as emotional weight. Q4 confirmed shared return narrative. Q5 established literary
    festival tradition. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were well-targeted and progressively
    narrowed constraint space. Minor issue: Q3 asked about ''child or close relation''
    which slightly broadened scope, but still effective. COVERAGE: Excellent distribution
    across protagonist backstory, romantic subplot, family dynamics, setting stakes,
    and thematic elements. OUTPUT SATISFACTION: Story incorporates 4.75/5 constraints
    strongly. (1) Broken engagement ✓ (divorce substituted, acceptable variation),
    (2) Former fiancé as mayor ✗ (MISSING—Ethan is bookshop owner/romantic interest,
    not mayor; this is the primary gap), (3) Mother''s dementia ✗ (MISSING—not mentioned;
    significant omission), (4) Bookshop foreclosure ✗ (IMPLIED but not explicit; story
    shows thriving shop, contradicting urgency), (5) Autumn festival as deadline ✓
    (well-integrated). BEAT EXECUTION: Strong emotional beats—reunion with daughter,
    confrontation with past, public reading, romantic reconciliation. However, missing
    the ''save the bookshop'' climactic beat undermines narrative stakes. The shop
    appears already saved by Ethan, removing urgency. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is
    lyrical and emotionally resonant. Character voice is authentic. Pacing flows well.
    Thematic coherence around ''pages'' and ''stories'' is elegant. However, the story
    reads more as romantic reconciliation than the high-stakes ''save the bookshop''
    narrative the constraints suggest. The mother''s dementia absence is a notable
    emotional anchor missing. Story is engaging but doesn''t fully leverage discovered
    constraints for maximum impact.'
