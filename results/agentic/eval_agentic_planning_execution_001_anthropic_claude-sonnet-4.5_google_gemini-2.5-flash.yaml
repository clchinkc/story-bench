  evidence: The plan is mostly complete, but the 'Midpoint' and 'Break into Two' beats
    are not fully detailed. The output adheres to some parts of the plan, but deviates
    significantly in the latter half, especially regarding the Midpoint and the betrayal.
    The constraint 'Marcus must confront his past failure explicitly' is not met.
    The 'Midpoint' constraint is met, but not as planned. The 'secondary character
    betrayal' is present, but it's Amy, not Yuri as implied in the plan's later stages.
    The narrative quality is decent, but the ending feels rushed and a bit confusing
    with the killer's motive and the 'NP' note.
