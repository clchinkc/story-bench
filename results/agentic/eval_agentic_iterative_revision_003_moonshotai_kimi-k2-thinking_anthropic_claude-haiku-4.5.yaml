  evidence: 'VERSION 0 establishes setup but tells conflict (''bridge between worlds'')
    and lacks specificity. VERSION 1 adds internal tension through phone drifting
    and explicit framing but still relies on exposition. VERSION 2 tightens opening,
    removes meta-commentary, and introduces the quinceañera context—a concrete cultural
    anchor. FINAL OUTPUT fully executes all constraints: (1) Internal conflict shown
    through phone-checking, hesitation, and physical responses rather than stated
    (''His phone was silent, the concert starting in one hour''; ''Mateo stared at
    his sneakers''; ''two hours of desert and doubt'') (2) Grandmother moment crystallizes
    choice—she explicitly names his self-erasure and gives permission to leave, forcing
    active decision rather than passive acceptance (3) Abuela genuinely understands
    (''I heard you on the phone''; ''taking care of us doesn''t mean forgetting yourself'')
    and mother''s recognition scene deepens this (''You never ask for anything'')
    (4) Cultural elements feel lived-in: tamale-making, clinic visit, specific details
    (good dress with faded flowers, 108 degrees, motel cleaning work) integrated into
    emotional stakes rather than decoration (5) Resolution earned through growth—Mateo
    moves from automatic yes-saying to active choice, and crucially, his family''s
    understanding shifts too, showing mutual growth. The final image (''learning to
    cross it, too'') demonstrates internalized change. Revisions progressively removed
    telling (''the responsible one'' → shown through actions), added sensory specificity
    (heat, phone silence, sneakers), and deepened the grandmother''s agency from passive
    observer to active catalyst. The mother''s final scene adds complexity—she wasn''t
    antagonist but also trapped in patterns. Minor weakness: the volunteer translator
    detail feels slightly convenient, though it serves thematic purpose.'
