  evidence: Initial draft (V0) already showed Sarah's habits (counting steps) and
    fog imagery but was lighter on narrative stakes. Revisions V1–V3 made only modest,
    incremental edits (notebook details, tightened phrasing) without changing structure.
    The final output added the crucial recognition beat (Marcus Voss), clarified the
    fog's active role in concealing the body's arrival and Riggs's expression (establishing
    a local secret), and closed on a true moment of decision. Overall the piece preserved
    early strengths (methodical actions, mood) while adding the decisive recognition
    and clearer narrative function for the fog; improvements were substantive but
    incremental rather than wholesale.
