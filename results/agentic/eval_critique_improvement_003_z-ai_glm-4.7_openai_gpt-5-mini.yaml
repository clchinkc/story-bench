  evidence: 'Across versions the author tightened Zara''s diction and increased age-appropriate
    dialogue (added mutters, short commands, and tactile reactions) to answer critiques
    about an overly mature internal voice. The Sun-Spear and radar rig (strengths
    present in V0) were preserved and slightly clarified. The final draft keeps the
    call to adventure, an explicit adult dismissal, a clearly flawed mentor (tremor
    and drinking), and a real, high-stakes crossing (Category 5 surge, shredding currents).
    Remaining issues: intermittent authorial/philosophical lines (e.g., ''If it sparked,
    you could fix it.''; ''Adults sat around waiting...'') still read older than a
    12-year-old’s internal perspective, so youth_voice concerns were reduced but not
    eliminated.'
