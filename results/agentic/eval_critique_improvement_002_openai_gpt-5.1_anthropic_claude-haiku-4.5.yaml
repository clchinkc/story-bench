  evidence: 'The final output demonstrates strong constraint satisfaction across all
    five requirements: (1) Humor lands immediately (''Do you guys have a foster home
    for moms who fake their orgasms so their husbands can watch SportsCenter?'') before
    the emotional reveal (''Nothing did''); (2) Theme (''all just sandcastles...the
    tide''s gonna erase'') is stated by Margo, a minor character, not Marcus; (3)
    Comedy craft is evident in specific technical detail (setup-two-beat-hold-misdirect-release
    rhythm, callback structure, product integration jokes); (4) Lena demonstrates
    sophisticated perception (''quick and assessing, like someone reading a punchline
    before it landed'') and immediately challenges Marcus''s cynicism with her own
    wit; (5) The near-break moment occurs when Margo''s existential comment triggers
    Marcus''s chest tightening, which he covers with a cough and deflection joke about
    selling feet pics. Critique responsiveness is strong: early critiques identified
    emotional complexity as the core strength, and revisions preserved this while
    deepening character interaction. The trajectory shows improvement in Lena''s introduction—she
    arrives fully formed as a character who sees through Marcus rather than being
    naive, addressing a potential weakness. Preservation is excellent: the original
    emotional core (the disconnect between technical mastery and genuine feeling)
    remains intact while the writers'' room dynamics become more textured. Beat execution
    follows Save the Cat structure: inciting incident (Lena''s arrival), rising action
    (her pitch and Marcus''s recognition of her skill), midpoint (her theme statement),
    climax building (her TED Talk pitch that cuts close to real pain). Minor gaps:
    the story cuts off mid-scene before full resolution, and the showrunner''s character
    could have slightly more dimension. The industry authenticity feels calibrated
    and specific (stress balls, Cheeto-stained fingers, Standards and Practices references).'
