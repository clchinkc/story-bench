  evidence: 'All six constraints are present in the final output: false lead (stalker
    suspect), unconventional profiling (psychological patterns), ticking clock (explicitly
    stated ''raced against the clock''), secondary-character betrayal (Emily informs
    the FBI), Midpoint direct confrontation (Marcus faces photograph and admits failure),
    and Marcus explicitly confronting his past failure (''I failed you''). Required
    beats Catalyst (phone call/new murder), Debate (hesitation about FBI and crime-scene
    doubts), Break into Two (chooses to dig deeper using unconventional methods),
    and Midpoint (emotional confrontation with photo) are all executed. The original
    plan, however, was incomplete/fragmentary — it omitted an explicit ticking-clock
    and did not clearly state Emily''s eventual betrayal (and the Midpoint was cut
    off), so plan_completeness is reduced. The prose follows the plan closely and
    delivers a coherent, paced narrative with decent tension, though some elements
    (ticking clock, betrayal) are stronger in the draft than in the plan itself.'
