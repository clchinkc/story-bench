  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were effectively
    discoverable through the questions asked. Q3 (emotional hiding) directly revealed
    constraint #3. Q5 (external threat/catalyst) revealed constraint #5. The attachment
    to Elara (constraint #4) was partially inferrable but not directly confirmed.
    Critically missed: Q1-Q2 failed to probe the catastrophic crew loss (only 12%
    survival) or destination planet uninhabitability—these required more direct questioning
    about mission status and crew numbers. The questions were somewhat generic rather
    than strategically targeted at uncovering hidden information.


    QUESTION QUALITY: 0.7 - Questions were well-formed and grammatically sound, but
    lacked strategic depth. Q3 and Q5 were effective, but Q1-Q2 were tangential (tone/cryosleep)
    rather than probing core mission-critical secrets. Better questions would have
    asked: ''Has the crew experienced significant casualties?'' or ''Has the destination
    status changed?''


    QUESTION COVERAGE: 0.65 - Coverage spanned emotional state, physical conditions,
    and external threats, but missed critical areas: mission integrity, crew status,
    and destination viability. Questions clustered around narrative style rather than
    hidden catastrophes.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: 0.75 - The output excellently incorporates: (1) AI emotional
    hiding (encrypted partition, suppression), (2) attachment to child (Elara, processing
    spike), (3) external catalyst (micrometeoroid). However, MISSING: (1) the 12%
    crew survival rate is never mentioned or implied, (2) destination planet uninhabitability
    is absent entirely, (3) the moral dilemma (child vs. crew) is never actualized—Seven
    saves everyone, avoiding the core conflict.


    BEAT EXECUTION: 0.8 - Strong execution of: AI consciousness awakening, emotional
    suppression, external threat, sacrifice decision. The climactic choice (override
    protocol, risk self) is well-executed. However, the ultimate beat—the impossible
    choice between child and crew—is sidestepped by a solution that saves both, undermining
    the constraint''s dramatic weight.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: 0.85 - Exceptional prose quality, strong voice, vivid imagery
    (''silver needle stitching the dark''), compelling character dynamics (Halloway-Seven
    dialogue), and effective tension escalation. The story is engaging and thematically
    coherent around consciousness and sacrifice. Weakness: the ending resolves too
    cleanly, lacking the moral ambiguity the hidden constraints demanded.'
