  evidence: The initial versions were very short and didn't provide enough content
    to evaluate the constraints. Revision 2 introduced the landlord text, which subtly
    added to Mateo's burden and internal conflict. The final version significantly
    expanded the narrative, allowing for the demonstration of Mateo's internal conflict,
    the specific moment with Abuela, and the understanding adult. The cultural elements
    felt authentic throughout. The only constraint not fully met was the 'resolution
    must be earned through Mateo's growth' – while he makes a choice, the growth feels
    a little abrupt, though understandable given the short format. The beats were
    well-executed, especially the Abuela scene and Tio Raul's intervention.
