  evidence: 'Plan: fully addresses required beats and constraints with concrete scenes
    (Tokyo apartment, KAI-7, McMurdo, Elias Voss, Dr. Lien Zhao with penguin, psychological
    crossing). Final output adherence: closely follows plan (call to adventure, refusal,
    mentor meeting, psychological threshold, colleague challenge, surprising human
    connection). Primary failure: the alien signal becomes anthropomorphized in the
    translation/quoted lines (e.g., ''You are not the first...The void does not hate
    you''), which undermines the constraint that the signal must feel genuinely alien.
    All other constraints are satisfied (isolation shown via behaviors; colleague
    challenges Yuki; mentor unconventional; threshold psychological; genuine human
    connection present). Narrative quality is strong (good pacing, tension, emotional
    payoff) but slightly weakened by the humanized signal.'
