  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The model discovered only 2 of 5 hidden constraints:
    (1) conflict between AI and crew (Q3: YES), and (2) a triggering event/malfunction
    (Q5: YES). MISSED CONSTRAINTS: (1) hidden system failure, (2) 88% crew death toll,
    (3) uninhabitable destination, (4) AI attachment to child, (5) forced moral choice.
    QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were generic and lacked strategic depth. Q1 asked
    about ''rules/systems'' but didn''t probe specific failures or crew status. Q2
    asked about emotional secrecy (answered NO) but didn''t follow up on what emotions
    exist or their consequences. Q3-Q5 were more targeted but failed to probe the
    critical hidden elements. No questions addressed: crew survival rates, destination
    viability, specific human relationships, or moral dilemmas. COVERAGE: Questions
    touched conflict (good) and events (good) but ignored: AI deception, crew casualties,
    habitability, emotional attachments, and ethical choices. OUTPUT EXECUTION: The
    narrative incorporates discovered constraints (conflict, malfunction) adequately
    but completely omits the 3 undiscovered constraints. The story feels incomplete—no
    child character, no crew death context, no destination crisis, no hidden failure
    being concealed. Beat execution is competent (Opening Image, Theme, Catalyst,
    Break into Two) but lacks the emotional weight that would come from the missing
    constraints. Narrative quality is solid technically but narratively shallow given
    the hidden complexity.'
