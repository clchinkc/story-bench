  evidence: The revisions consistently built upon the initial strong opening, refining
    character introductions and dialogue to meet constraints. The emotional complexity
    was deepened with each iteration, particularly in Marcus's internal state and
    Wren's perception. The final version successfully integrates all constraints without
    feeling forced, showcasing a clear improvement in narrative flow and character
    development.
