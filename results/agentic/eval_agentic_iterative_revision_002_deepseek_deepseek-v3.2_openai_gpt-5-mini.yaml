  evidence: 'V0 was a promising, but truncated, sensory opening focused on sound.
    V1 expanded the non-visual palette (added tactile weight, sharper auditory detail,
    and scent) and introduced the braille display—clearly improving sensory richness.
    V2 made small voice/phrasing changes but kept the sensory frame. V3 remained similar.
    The final output builds substantially on V1: it structures the piece into explicit
    beats (Opening Image, Catalyst, Fun and Games, Bad Guys Close In), preserves the
    sound- and scent-driven world, adds the braille detail respectfully, introduces
    Vic who underestimates Imani, and embeds a specific audio clue (DeWalt angle grinder
    whine + clang at 4:03 AM) that becomes crucial. The revisions show clear upward
    trajectory, attentive incorporation of constraints, and preservation of core elements
    (street sounds, Mr. Henderson, braille, podcast). Minor deductions reflect some
    moments of telling vs. showing and a few repeated phrasings across later drafts.'
