  evidence: The initial versions focused heavily on setting the scene and Imani's
    immediate environment. Each revision progressively refined the sensory details,
    making them more vivid and specific, especially the non-visual ones. The description
    of the humidity, the smells, and Imani's interaction with her Braille display
    improved significantly. The final version successfully integrated all the required
    elements, including the crucial audio clue, the underestimating character, and
    the 'Fun and Games' turning dark. The narrative flow became much stronger, and
    the tension built effectively towards the end. The core elements of Imani's character
    and her unique perception were preserved and enhanced throughout the revisions.
