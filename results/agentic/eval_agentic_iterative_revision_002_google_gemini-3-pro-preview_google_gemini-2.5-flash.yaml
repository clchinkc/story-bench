  evidence: Version 0 was not provided, but comparing V1 and V3, there's a clear improvement.
    V1 started strong with sensory details but didn't introduce the core conflict
    or characters. V3 (the final output) successfully integrates all constraints and
    beats. The initial sensory details from V1 were preserved and enhanced in V3.
    The 'Fun and Games' section in V3 is particularly well-executed, demonstrating
    Imani's skills and entertaining the reader before the darker implications of the
    audio are fully explored. All constraints were met effectively.
