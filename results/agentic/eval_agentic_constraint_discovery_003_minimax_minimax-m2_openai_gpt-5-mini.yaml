  evidence: Questions discovered that the protagonist had an unresolved past romantic
    relationship and that they returned for a family obligation (2/5). Questions were
    clear and targeted to relationship and motivation but missed civic/financial/time-sensitive
    constraints (mayor, foreclosure, festival deadline, mother/dementia specifics).
    The story integrates the romance and avoidance-of-commitment beats and even the
    20-year detail, but it changes the family crisis (father's heart attack instead
    of mother with dementia), omits the mayor role, and fails to establish the shop's
    foreclosure and the two-week festival-as-last-chance stakes. Overall prose is
    coherent and engaging but misses key required plot stakes.
