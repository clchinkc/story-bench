  evidence: 'Only 1 of 5 hidden constraints was incorporated: protagonist left town
    20 years ago after a broken engagement (explicit). Missing or altered: former
    fiancé is not presented as the town mayor (he runs the bookstore), protagonist
    returned for a father''s heart attack rather than mother''s early-stage dementia,
    no mention of foreclosure or the shop needing to be saved, and the autumn festival
    appears but is not framed as the last-chance, two-week deadline to save the shop.
    Writing quality is good (engaging, coherent), but key plot constraints and stakes
    are largely omitted.'
