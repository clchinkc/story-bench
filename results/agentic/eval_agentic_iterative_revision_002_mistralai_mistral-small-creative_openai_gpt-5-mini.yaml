  evidence: 'Version 0 is an opening fragment with general atmosphere and a podcast
    hook but limited sensory focus and plot. Version 1 improves sensory detail (smells,
    street sounds) and deepens the scene. Version 2 pivots strongly to non-visual,
    auditory detail (steam hissing, cart wheel rhythm) and makes Imani''s listening
    skill central. Version 3 (final) transforms the piece into a complete short scene
    with clear beats: the catalytic voicemail audio clue (the creak and thump) is
    isolated and made crucial; the Fun and Games sequence (the Greasy Spoon banter)
    genuinely entertains before escalating into violence and the Bad Guys Closed In;
    a character (Detective Reyes) initially underestimates Imani and is later forced
    to respect her; Imani''s blindness is shown through her screen reader, heightened
    listening, and agency, presented respectfully as a strength. Overall, each revision
    built on and preserved the core auditory focus while adding plot structure, stakes,
    and stronger characterization.'
