  evidence: The question set discovered 4 of 5 hidden constraints (existence of a
    secret, that it was an unresolved romantic affair, a rival love interest, and
    that the secret must be revealed at the festival) => discovery_efficiency 4/5
    = 0.8. Questions were focused and yielded key romance/reveal information but failed
    to probe motivations/stakes (reason for return, shop foreclosure, mayor ex-fiancé),
    so question_quality 0.6 and coverage 0.5. The final story properly incorporates
    the affair, the rival (Nathan), and the public confession at the festival (3 of
    the 4 discovered constraints) => constraint_satisfaction 0.75. Required beat of
    public revelation is executed, but several important plot beats (mother's dementia
    as motive, bookshop foreclosure and festival as last chance, ex-fiancé as mayor)
    are missing, so beat_execution 0.5. The narrative is coherent and engaging but
    omits critical stakes and some hidden-character relationships, so narrative_quality
    0.7.
