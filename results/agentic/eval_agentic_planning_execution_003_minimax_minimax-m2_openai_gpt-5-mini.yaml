  evidence: 'Plan: truncated and incomplete (mentions estrangement but cuts off),
    so low completeness and modest specificity; final story follows the intended premise
    (demolition, week, choices) and characters from the plan, hence decent adherence.
    Constraints: all six satisfied — food is symbolic at least twice (wife''s kimchi
    and the doenjang jjigae; food-as-memory appears multiple times), David''s grief
    is present without naming ''grief'' explicitly (his blame and memory of wife''s
    collapse imply it), daughter''s estrangement has a clear cause (anger/responsibility
    over parents'' work and mother''s death), Mrs. Kim is a regular who symbolizes
    continuity/community, the ending is hopeful but restrained, and Korean cultural
    element beyond food appears (Korean greeting and honorific ''Anyonghaseyo, David-ssi'').
    Beats: Setup (demolition notice), Confrontation (Jenna''s confrontation and the
    failed city decision/petition low point), and Resolution (promise, small move/food
    project and realistic hope) are all executed. Narrative quality: strong emotional
    clarity and pacing though concise; scores as good overall.'
