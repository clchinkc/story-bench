  evidence: 'All six constraints are present in the final story: food symbolism appears
    multiple times (kimchi, dumplings, tea), David''s grief is shown indirectly through
    rituals and keepsakes, daughter''s estrangement has a specific cause (missed graduation
    due to a restaurant emergency), Mrs. Chen is a regular who embodies continuity/tradition,
    ending is hopeful but realistic (sale to another Korean family, recipe box passed
    to Sarah), and Korean cultural elements beyond food appear (hanbok, barley tea).
    The three required beats are clearly executed: Setup (demolition notice, kimchi
    morning, Mrs. Chen), Confrontation/Midpoint (Sarah''s arrival and the argument
    over missed graduation and family memory), Resolution (community dinner, sale
    to the Kim family, recipe box given to Sarah). The plan was detailed (days, characters,
    cultural elements) and the story follows it closely, with minor compressions of
    timing and some emotional beats handled gently rather than deeply dramatized,
    which slightly lowers completeness/specificity scores but preserves narrative
    coherence and a believable, hopeful ending.'
