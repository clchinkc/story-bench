  evidence: The initial versions struggled with the opening and establishing Imani's
    unique abilities. Version 0 was too generic. Version 1 and 2 tried to incorporate
    more sensory details but still felt a bit scattered. Version 3 and the final output
    significantly improved by focusing on specific, quantifiable audio details that
    immediately showcase Imani's skill and set up the 'audio clue' constraint. The
    'Fun and Games' section was well-developed and genuinely entertaining before the
    turn. The 'Bad Guys Close In' beat effectively used the audio clue. The only constraint
    not fully met was the 'Imani's blindness as a strength' which was present but
    could have been more explicitly highlighted as a unique advantage rather than
    just a skill. The initial underestimation of Imani was present in Marcus's initial
    reaction, but could have been slightly more pronounced.
