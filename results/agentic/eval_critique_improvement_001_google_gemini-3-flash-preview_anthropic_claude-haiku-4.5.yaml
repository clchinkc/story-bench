  evidence: 'CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.95/1.0): All five constraints are satisfied.
    (1) Methodical nature shown through action: pen alignment, file organization,
    precise measurements (12''4"), calipers use, chronological questioning. (2) Fog
    serves narrative purpose: navigation obstacle, concealment of Elias''s guilt,
    atmospheric pressure that mirrors Sarah''s internal conflict, creates the moment
    of isolation where decision occurs. (3) Local character secret: Elias guards the
    cannery illegally, accepts payment for silence, facilitates the ''no lights''
    vessel. (4) Past case hinted before reveal: ''phantom ringing of a Seattle gunshot,''
    ''basement where lights never stopped flickering,'' ''witness she had sworn to
    protect''—all precede the Sparrow identification. (5) Ends on decision: Sarah
    chooses to reactivate the case rather than defer to State Police, calling her
    contact and committing to return. Minor gap: the decision moment could be slightly
    more ambiguous/weighted.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.92/1.0): Three required beats executed strongly. (1) Inciting
    incident: Elias''s call about the body. (2) Complication/revelation: The Sparrow
    pin triggers recognition of the witness from her past case. (3) Decision point:
    Sarah chooses to pursue rather than hand off. Execution is clean and emotionally
    resonant. The reveal lands with impact due to careful foreshadowing.


    CHARACTER VOICE (0.90/1.0): Sarah''s methodical nature permeates action. Pen alignment,
    file stacking, time recording, precise measurements, calipers, chronological questioning,
    procedural language (''sharp blade,'' ''cold, procedural edge''). Her internal
    conflict emerges through rhythm breaks and the Seattle memory intrusion. Voice
    is consistent and distinctive.


    ATMOSPHERE (0.88/1.0): Fog functions on multiple levels—sensory obstacle, concealment
    device, emotional correlate to Sarah''s isolation, and practical narrative tool
    (forces reliance on sound/touch, creates the moment of clarity when the pin is
    revealed). The fog ''closes back in'' at the decision point, heightening stakes.
    Excellent integration.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.88/1.0): Prose is sharp and controlled. Sentence rhythm varies
    effectively (short procedural statements vs. longer atmospheric passages). The
    reveal of the Sparrow is well-earned through layered foreshadowing. Dialogue feels
    natural. Minor weaknesses: the final phone call could have slightly more tension/hesitation
    to deepen the decision weight; some readers may want more sensory detail about
    the body itself.


    CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.85/1.0): The three critiques all scored 0.90-1.0 on
    constraint satisfaction, suggesting the story was already strong. However, the
    versions provided appear identical in the truncated excerpts shown, making it
    difficult to assess what specific revisions were made in response to feedback.
    The final output does not show demonstrable changes from Version 0 to Version
    3 in the provided text. This suggests either: (a) revisions were made to sections
    not shown, or (b) the story was locked early and minor tweaks were made. Score
    reflects uncertainty about actual revision process.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.75/1.0): Without visible differences between versions
    in the provided excerpts, trajectory cannot be fully assessed. The final output
    is strong, but the claim of three revisions is not evidenced in the materials
    shown. If revisions occurred off-screen, they may have refined pacing or secondary
    details, but the core strengths (methodical characterization, fog integration,
    Sparrow reveal) appear consistent across all versions. Score reflects this limitation.


    PRESERVATION (0.90/1.0): The final output preserves all identified strengths from
    the critiques: the pen alignment opening, file organization, precise measurements,
    Elias''s nervous behavior, the fog mechanics, and the Sparrow reveal. No elements
    were stripped or weakened. The story maintains its core identity while presumably
    incorporating refinements.'
