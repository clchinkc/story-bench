  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on the 'youth_voice' criterion, specifically
    pointing out a few instances of overly sophisticated language ('hope made tangible').
    While the final output still contains a phrase that could be considered slightly
    mature for a 12-year-old ('not mentioning that she'd been awake three nights rebuilding
    solar filters while everyone else slept. That Marcus probably stayed awake too,
    staring at his broken ear.'), the most egregious example ('hope made tangible')
    was removed. The overall voice remains strong and authentic for a 12-year-old,
    indicating good responsiveness to the feedback. The story's core strengths, such
    as the vivid worldbuilding and character dynamics, were preserved throughout the
    revisions. The constraint satisfaction is excellent, with all five constraints
    clearly met in the final version. The beat execution is also strong, effectively
    setting up the call to adventure and the refusal/acceptance.
