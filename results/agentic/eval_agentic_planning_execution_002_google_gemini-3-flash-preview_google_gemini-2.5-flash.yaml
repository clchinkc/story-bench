  evidence: 'The plan is comprehensive and detailed, covering all constraints and
    beats with specific examples. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan.
    All constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through ''echo-checking,''
    noise-canceling headphones, and avoiding eye contact; the signal is genuinely
    alien (gravitational fluctuations, smells, tactile sensations); Marcus Vane challenges
    Yuki''s approach; Dr. Aris Thorne is an unconventional mentor (analog synthesizer,
    ''stop looking for grammar''); the Threshold is psychological (dropping professional
    armor, letting noise in); and the moment of human connection with Vane is surprising
    and impactful. All four beats (Call to Adventure, Refusal, Mentor, Threshold)
    are clearly executed. The narrative quality is excellent, with strong pacing and
    character development.'
