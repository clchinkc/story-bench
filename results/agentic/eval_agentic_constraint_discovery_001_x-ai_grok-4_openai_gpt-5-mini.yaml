  evidence: Out of five hidden constraints, the agent's questions revealed two relevant
    constraints (mentor death and forging a weapon). Questions were moderately strategic
    but missed key constraints (time limit, protagonist cannot use magic, father-as-failed-hero).
    The story incorporates the discovered items (mentor dies early, forging occurs
    during the Ordeal) but also introduces an undiscovered magical ability and omits
    the three-day deadline and the father's backstory. Beats are executed coherently,
    though some required hidden constraints were either violated or not addressed.
