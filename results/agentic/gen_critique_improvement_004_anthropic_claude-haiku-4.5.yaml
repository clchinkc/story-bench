    STORY THEORY: Story Circle


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker
    who has

    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for

    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.


    - Central conflict: When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will
    take 6 months,

    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting

    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.


    - Tone: Quietly profound, observant, gently humorous


    REQUIRED BEATS: You (comfort zone), Need (want something), Go (unfamiliar situation),
    Search (adapt to it)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Teddy''s routine must be shown with specific, loving detail

    - The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been avoiding

    - Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s

    - Teddy''s late wife must be present through absence

    - The new path must offer something the old path couldn''t


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - character_interiority: Is Teddy''s inner life rich and specific?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Story Circle beats properly executed?

    - subtlety: Are emotions conveyed through action and detail, not exposition?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and resonance


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

    ## CRITERION: Character Interiority

    **SCORE: 0.75**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Strong moments: "His palm went damp against his thigh" and "His heartbeat felt
    loud in his ears"—physical sensations that convey inner turmoil

    - Rich avoidance pattern established: "a street he''d avoided for thirty-seven
    years because Margaret had looked at a house there once"

    - Perceptive self-awareness: "as if someone else was operating them, someone braver"


    **FEEDBACK:**

    Teddy''s inner life is contemplative but remains somewhat surface-level. You show
    his *feeling* but less of his *reasoning*. When he decides to walk Pearl Street,
    deepen the internal debate. What specific memory of Margaret pulls him forward?
    What fear holds him back? Give readers access to the competing impulses, not just
    the physical aftermath. For example, before "his legs kept moving," consider:
    *What does he fear more—staying tethered to the old route, or confronting what
    that route protected him from?*

    ## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction

    **SCORE: 1.0**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    1. **Routine with loving detail**: "left on Elm, where the Hendersons'' maple
    tree always dropped precisely two branches by autumn; down the gentle slope of
    Maple Street"—specific, temporal, intimate

    2. **Disruption reveals avoidance**: Construction forces Pearl Street; we learn
    he''s avoided it 37 years because of Margaret''s interest in a house there

    3. **Neighbor''s intersecting story**: Eleanor "lives three blocks over," lost
    her husband, understands his pilgrimage through familiar places

    4. **Margaret''s presence through absence**: The pearl-colored trim, her posture
    echoed in Eleanor, her absence as gravitational center

    5. **New path offers what old couldn''t**: Connection, forward movement, Eleanor''s
    presence, a route taken differently—"he finally walked home, it was a different
    way"


    **FEEDBACK:**

    All five constraints are fully satisfied. No improvement needed here.

    Theodore Washington woke at 5:47 a.m., three minutes before his alarm. Forty years
    of postal routes had taught his body to wake before clocks. Margaret used to say
    he was wound tighter than a metronome. That was before the cancer took her words

    He dressed in his uniform still—pressed navy shorts, polo shirt, the walking shoes
    broken in to the shape of his feet. He no longer worked, but the costume kept

    The route began at his corner: left on Elm, where the Hendersons'' maple tree

    On a Tuesday in March, the route vanished.


    Construction barriers blocked Maple Street. A new condo development, the signs
    announced. Eighteen months. Theodore stood holding nothing—no mail to deliver,
    no structure to complete. Just the barrier and the detour sign pointing him sideways
    into unfamiliar blocks.


    He could have stayed home. But somehow he walked, turning onto Pearl Street, a
    street he''d avoided for thirty-seven years because Margaret had looked at a house
    there once. Before the children. Before he''d taken the postal route that paid
    less but started so early he wouldn''t have to think.

    tree always dropped precisely two branches by autumn; down the gentle slope of
    Maple Street"—specific, temporal, intimate

    2. **Disruption reveals avoidance**: Construction forces Pearl Street; we learn
    he''s avoided it 37 years because of Margaret''s interest in a house there

    3. **Neighbor''s intersecting story**: Eleanor "lives three blocks over," lost
    her husband, understands his pilgrimage through familiar places

    4. **Margaret''s presence through absence**: The pearl-colored trim, her posture
    echoed in Eleanor, her absence as gravitational center

    5. **New path offers what old couldn''t**: Connection, forward movement, Eleanor''s
    presence, a route taken differently—"he finally walked home, it was a different
    way"


    **FEEDBACK:**

    All five constraints are fully satisfied. No improvement needed here.

    Theodore Washington woke at 5:47 a.m., three minutes before his alarm. Forty years
    of postal routes had taught his body to wake before clocks. Margaret used to say
    he was wound tighter than a metronome. That was before the cancer took her words
    away.


    He dressed in his uniform still—pressed navy shorts, polo shirt, the walking shoes
    broken in to the shape of his feet. He no longer worked, but the costume kept
    the day organized. Purpose had a uniform.


    The route began at his corner: left on Elm, where the Hendersons'' maple tree
    always dropped precisely two branches by autumn; down the gentle slope of Maple
    Street where he''d watched Mrs. Chen''s house deteriorate, then witnessed the
    orange excavator arrive last summer; past the coffee shop that used to be Tom''s
    Hardware in 1983. He knew by the quality of light on the pavement what time it
    was. He knew which dogs would bark behind which fences—all except the retriever
    moved to Grosse Pointe in 2009. He could navigate this route in his sleep, and
    most mornings, he half did.


    But lately, even the familiar felt hollow. Three miles of muscle memory with no
    heart behind it.


    On a Tuesday in March, the route vanished.


    Construction barriers blocked Maple Street. A new condo development, the signs
    announced. Eighteen months. Theodore stood holding nothing—no mail to deliver,
    no structure to complete. Just the barrier and the detour sign pointing him sideways
    into unfamiliar blocks.


    He could have stayed home. Should have. Instead, he found himself walking toward
    Pearl Street, the one street he''d navigated around for thirty-seven years. Margaret
    had looked at a house there once—Saturday afternoon, that particular quality of
    light she loved. She''d traced her finger over the pearl-colored trim. "What do
    you think?" He''d said "too small" and "too expensive" and "the commute"—all true,
    none true. The real reason sat heavier: he was afraid. Afraid of how much she
    wanted it. Afraid that wanting things meant losing them. Safer to keep moving,
    to build a route so rigid nothing could disrupt it.


    His feet slowed at the corner of Pearl Street. The house was painted gunmetal
    gray now. The garden window was boarded up. A wave of something moved through
    him—not quite grief, but its echo. All these years avoiding this street meant
    avoiding the fact that he''d been running from her while pretending to run toward
    duty. His palm went damp. He could still turn back, pick another route entirely.
    But he kept walking, as if someone else was operating his legs, someone braver
    or maybe just someone tired of being afraid.


    He discovered the neighborhood like archaeology. Here was a little park he''d
    never encountered, where a woman his age sat on a bench, reading. She had Margaret''s
    posture—spine straight, one knee crossed precisely over the other. Theodore''s
    throat tightened.


    "First time here?" he asked.


    She looked up, studied him. "Every morning since my husband passed. I live three
    blocks over. You married?"


    "Was."


    "Then you know why we''re here," she said. "The familiar places hold them. But
    they also hold us still."


    He felt something catch inside his chest—the space where pain had been, suddenly
    apparent. He sat, something he''d never allowed himself on the route.


    "I''m Eleanor," she said.


    "Theodore."


    A young couple walked past, pointing at a renovated rowhouse with fresh flowers
    in the window box. The neighborhood was erasing itself and being born simultaneously.


    Eleanor stood to leave. "Same bench tomorrow?"


    "I don''t know my way back," he admitted.


    She smiled—not quite Margaret''s smile, but close enough to matter. "Then you''d
    better find out."


    That evening, Theodore studied the map obsessively, tracing routes, testing distances.
    On Wednesday morning, he walked thirty-seven years backward. Eleanor was already
    there, two cups of coffee cooling on the bench.


    When he finally walked home, it was a different way than he''d come. The 3-mile
    route was still barricaded.


    He didn''t mind anymore. His heartbeat was still there. He could feel it now.'
