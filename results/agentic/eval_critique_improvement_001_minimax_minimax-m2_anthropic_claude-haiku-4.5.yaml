  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The revisions show minimal textual changes across
    versions 0-3, suggesting limited responsiveness to critique feedback. However,
    the final output demonstrates strong incorporation of critique points about methodical
    action (extensive photography/measurement sequences, systematic observation).
    The story shows Sarah''s process-driven thinking through concrete actions rather
    than exposition. Score reflects that critiques were validated but revision process
    appears incomplete. IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Quality plateaued early. Versions
    0-3 are nearly identical, indicating the writer locked in on a strong foundation
    quickly but didn''t iterate meaningfully. The final output adds substantial material
    (Act II and III) that wasn''t in earlier versions, showing late-stage expansion
    rather than iterative refinement. This is positive for completeness but suggests
    the critique loop didn''t drive incremental improvements. PRESERVATION: Excellent.
    Core strengths—Sarah''s methodical voice, fog as active element, atmospheric prose—are
    maintained throughout. The bait shop owner character and rope burn details appear
    consistently, showing intentional preservation of working elements. CONSTRAINT
    SATISFACTION: (1) Methodical nature through action: 0.95/1.0 - Extensively shown
    through photography angles, measurement techniques, systematic observation. (2)
    Fog serves narrative purpose: 0.90/1.0 - Fog hides evidence, controls timing,
    creates tension, enables the body''s discovery. Minor: occasionally drifts toward
    pure atmosphere. (3) Local character with secret: 0.85/1.0 - Bait shop owner hints
    at the *Eider* and night visitors, but secret feels partially revealed rather
    than fully concealed. (4) Past case hinted before revealed: 0.95/1.0 - RP casing,
    anchor tattoo, and Mara''s death are layered in effectively. (5) End on decision,
    not resolution: 0.90/1.0 - Ends with Sarah''s choice to stay and investigate,
    though the final paragraph slightly over-explains the decision. BEAT EXECUTION:
    Setup (Act I) is strong—establishes Sarah''s methods and introduces fog/harbor.
    Inciting incident (Act II) effectively triggers recognition of the anchor network.
    First plot point (Act III) raises stakes and forces decision. However, the decision
    moment could be sharper; the final paragraph tells rather than shows the commitment.
    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is engaging with strong sensory details (salt, rope,
    fog textures). Voice is consistent and compelling. Pacing accelerates appropriately.
    Weaknesses: some repetition of ''fog'' metaphors, occasional over-explanation
    of Sarah''s internal state, and the ending paragraph slightly undermines the ''moment
    of decision'' constraint by narrating the decision rather than embodying it. The
    rope burn detail and RP casing are excellent connective tissue. Overall strong
    execution with minor refinement needed on constraint 5.'
