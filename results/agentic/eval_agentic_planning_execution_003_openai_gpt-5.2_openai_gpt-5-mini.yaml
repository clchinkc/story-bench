  evidence: 'Plan addressed demolition, grief, estrangement cause, regular customer,
    kimchi and other food symbolism, and a community-based resolution. Final text
    follows the plan closely: Act 1 setup (notice, David''s routine), Act 2 midpoint
    confrontation (Mina''s arrival, argument about leaving, kimchi jar as symbol),
    Act 3 resolution (realistic hopeful solution: church-basement pop-ups, David will
    visit Mina). Constraints met: kimchi and peppermints/food used symbolically; grief
    implied via second cup, apron/photo/incense; explicit cause of estrangement given
    (David''s reaction after wife''s death, accusing Mina of abandoning her); Mr.
    Stan as regular who represents neighborhood memory; ending hopeful but restrained;
    Korean cultural element beyond food present (use of ''Appa'' and bowing). Writing
    quality: evocative prose, good pacing and subtle emotional tension (rated 0.9).'
