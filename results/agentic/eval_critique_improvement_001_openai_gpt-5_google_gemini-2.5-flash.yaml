  evidence: The initial versions were very short and lacked the depth needed to satisfy
    the constraints fully. Each revision added more detail, character interaction,
    and narrative elements that directly addressed the constraints. For example, the
    methodical nature of Sarah was expanded from just counting buoys to detailed observations
    and actions. The fog's narrative purpose became clearer with each iteration, moving
    from mere atmosphere to a tool for secrecy and a reflection of internal conflict.
    The local characters and their secrets were introduced and developed, and Sarah's
    past case was hinted at and then explicitly revealed, leading to a strong moment
    of decision. The story grew significantly in length and complexity, directly responding
    to the need for more robust constraint satisfaction and narrative development.
