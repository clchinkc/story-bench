  evidence: 'V0 established a basic sensory setup but was truncated. V1 responded
    by amplifying non-visual sensory detail (added Doppler effect, more smells and
    sounds). V2 refined that rhythm and wording, keeping the soundscape. V3/final
    introduced characters and dialogue (Imani and Rachel) but regressed on key constraints:
    blindness is never mentioned or framed as a strength; no specific audio clue is
    introduced or used later; no scene shows a character initially underestimating
    Imani; and there is no clear ''Fun and Games'' that entertains before turning
    dark. Overall, sensory description was preserved and slightly improved through
    V1–V2, but critical plot/character beats required by the brief were not implemented,
    so quality gains plateaued then partially regressed in the final version.'
