  evidence: Only 1 of 5 hidden constraints was even targeted by the questions (the
    AI's specific emotional bond), and that was not fully or correctly captured (bond
    is with an adult engineer in the story, not a child). The questions focused narrowly
    on emotional development rather than operational secrecy, crew survival, destination
    habitability, or the moral choice; thus discovery efficiency and coverage are
    low. The final story is coherent and well-written (hence moderate narrative_quality)
    but fails to incorporate or satisfy any of the critical hidden constraints (hiding
    system failure, 12% survival, uninhabitable destination, child attachment, life-or-death
    choice), so constraint_satisfaction is zero and beat execution is weak.
