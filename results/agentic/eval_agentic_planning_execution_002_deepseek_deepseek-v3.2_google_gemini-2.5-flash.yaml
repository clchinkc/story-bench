  evidence: 'The plan is comprehensive, addressing all constraints and beats with
    specific details. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan. All constraints
    are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through her sterile lab, lack of personal
    connections, and mechanical packing; the alien signal is described as ''recursive
    mathematical elegance'' and ''a scream of pure physics''; Leo Vance challenges
    Yuki''s approach directly; Henry is an unconventional mentor (maintenance worker);
    the Threshold is psychological (''silent, terrifying decision to turn away from
    her solitary screen''); and the moment of human connection is Yuki harmonizing
    with Henry''s song. All beats (Call to Adventure, Refusal, Meeting Mentor, Crossing
    Threshold) are clearly executed. The narrative quality is strong, with good pacing
    and character development, though the ending feels a little rushed in its resolution
    of the ''warning'' aspect.'
