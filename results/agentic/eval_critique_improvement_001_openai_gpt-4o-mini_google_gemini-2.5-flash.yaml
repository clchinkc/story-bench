  evidence: The initial versions were very similar, focusing on minor word changes.
    However, the final version shows significant improvement in addressing all constraints.
    Sarah's methodical nature is clearly shown through her actions (notepad, cataloging
    details). The fog serves a narrative purpose by obscuring vision, frustrating
    focus, and mirroring uncertainty. The fisherman and bartender provide local characters
    with secrets. Sarah's past case is hinted at early ('body tied to her past', 'memories
    of her last case') and then revealed with the scar. The ending is a clear moment
    of decision. The prose is engaging and well-paced.
