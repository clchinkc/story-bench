  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing character
    actions, symbolic elements, and cultural details. The final output adheres perfectly
    to the plan, executing all beats and constraints with skill. All 6 constraints
    are met: food symbolism (Ganjang, Kimbap), implicit grief (Table 4, Kowalski''s
    comment, David''s internal monologue), specific cause for estrangement (Hannah''s
    explanation), regular customer (Mr. Kowalski), hopeful but not unrealistic ending
    (moving forward, not fully resolved but a step), and Korean cultural element (Jeol,
    Onggi, Ganjang, Kimbap). The narrative quality is high, with good pacing, emotional
    depth, and a satisfying resolution.'
