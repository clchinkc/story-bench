  evidence: 'The plan is very complete and specific, addressing all constraints and
    beats with concrete details. The execution largely follows the plan, though the
    ending of the story output is cut off abruptly. All constraints are met: symbolic
    food (rice, doenjang-jjigae, kimchi), implicit grief (rice bowl, ''ghost'' comment,
    fortress metaphor), specific estrangement cause (David became a ''ghost'' after
    Mi-Sun''s death, ignoring Hannah), regular customer (Mr. Henderson representing
    history/obsolescence), hopeful but not unrealistically happy ending (David will
    visit, not move, looks at sky), and Korean cultural element (Soju rite, Mookeunji).
    All beats are clearly present and well-executed. The narrative quality is strong,
    with good pacing and emotional depth, despite the abrupt ending.'
