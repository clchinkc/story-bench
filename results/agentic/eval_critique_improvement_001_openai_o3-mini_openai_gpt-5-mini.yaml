  evidence: Across revisions the piece moved from telling to showing. V0 introduced
    Sarah and the fog but leaned on exposition. V1 tightened Sarah's actions (laying
    out tools) and clarified the fog; V2 made her movements slower, more deliberate,
    and framed tool-placement as ritual; V3 and the final text preserved those concrete
    actions and added functional uses of the fog (it obscures and later reveals footprints),
    introduced local characters with furtive details (Greg's furtive glances; Evelyn's
    guilt), and moved the hint of Sarah's past case earlier (the relic 'carried echoes'
    appears before the photograph reveal). The ending was revised to stop at a decision
    rather than resolve the plot. Overall, critiques about showing methodical behavior,
    giving the fog narrative purpose, embedding secrets, and hinting at the past were
    addressed and strengthened while preserving atmosphere and pacing.
