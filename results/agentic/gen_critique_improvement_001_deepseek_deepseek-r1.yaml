    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

  content: 'CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction

    SCORE: 0.82

    EVIDENCE: All five constraints are present: methodical action ("measured the distance
    between footprints with a steel ruler"), fog as obstacle/disorientation device,
    Eli''s secret (scratches), Baltimore hint ("No echoes of Baltimore''s failures"),
    decision ending (radio hover).

    FEEDBACK: The hint about Sarah''s past feels somewhat heavy-handed. "No echoes
    of Baltimore''s failures" is nearly explicit exposition disguised as internal
    thought. Consider burying this deeper—perhaps through Sarah''s physical reaction
    to the setting or a more oblique reference (e.g., "She''d chosen Harborview because
    it had no docks like *those* docks"). The constraint is technically satisfied
    but could be more subtle.

    CRITERION: Beat Execution

    SCORE: 0.92

    EVIDENCE: Setup ✓ (opening establishes Sarah, her methodology, the muted harbor
    world); Inciting Incident ✓ (corpse discovery clearly marked: "The corpse wore
    an expensive suit"); First Plot Point ✓ (kraken tattoo triggers flashback: "Baltimore''s
    docks flashed before her").

    FEEDBACK: Excellently structured. The beats land with clarity and momentum. The
    only minor note: the "boy found... thing at Dead Man''s Cove" could have slightly
    more dramatic weight in transmission—it''s delivered as exposition rather than
    urgent discovery, though this fits the fog-muffled communication.


    ---


    CRITERION: Character Voice

    SCORE: 0.88

    EVIDENCE: Strong action-based characterization: "photographed the marks methodically,"
    "Logic was her anchor," "cataloged: male, late thirties, lividity patterns."

    FEEDBACK: The phrase "Logic was her anchor. Intuition had drowned her partner"
    is explicit exposition that *tells* rather than *shows*. The story is strong enough
    that this could be replaced with behavioral evidence. For example, instead of
    the statement, show Sarah deliberately stepping back from assumptions, or checking
    her reasoning twice. The internal conflict is clear from context; this line underestimates
    the reader''s inference ability.


    ---


    CRITERION: Atmosphere

    SCORE: 0.93

    EVIDENCE: Fog functions on multiple levels: practical obstacle ("Static screeched
    from her radio when she tried calling"), psychological mirror ("Disorientation
    prickled her neck—the same creeping dread"), thematic concealment ("The fog thickened,
    erasing everything but the tattoo''s accusing lines").

    FEEDBACK: Exceptional use. The fog evolves from setting detail to active force.
    The temporary gap ("wind ripped a temporary gap in the fog") alongside Eli''s
    tell is particularly effective. No improvement needed; this is craft-level work.


    ---


    CRITERION: Narrative Quality

    SCORE: 0.84

    EVIDENCE: Excellent prose: "salt-crusted traps, fog swallowing sound and horizon,"
    "The corpse wore an expensive suit gone stiff with brine." Effective compression:
    "Routine. Until her tweezers lifted the sleeve." Strong image: "tentacle hooked
    into an hourglass."

    FEEDBACK: Two areas for refinement: (1) "Harborview''s off-season silence choked
    the wharf" is slightly mixed metaphor—silence can''t choke, though the Gothic
    tone works. Consider: "Harborview''s off-season silence *hung over* the wharf"
    or separate the image. (2) The pacing stumbles slightly when Eli warns of the
    storm—the transition from footprin investigation to radio broadcast could be smoother.
    Consider a transitional sentence bridging the two scenes.


    ---


    OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:

    This is strong, accomplished work that satisfies all requirements while maintaining
    engaging prose and genuine tension. The primary weakness is occasional over-explanation
    of character psychology ("Logic was her anchor") when the narrative already demonstrates
    it convincingly. The fog''s multivalent use and the mystery surrounding Eli elevate
    this above competent constraint-satisfaction into genuinely compelling storytelling.
    With minor revision to tighten exposition and refine metaphorical language, this
    would be ready for publication.'

    \ Point ✓ (kraken tattoo triggers flashback: \"Baltimore's docks flashed before\
    \ her\").\nFEEDBACK: Excellently structured. The beats land with clarity and momentum.\
    \ The only minor note: the \"boy found... thing at Dead Man's Cove\" could have\
    \ slightly more dramatic weight in transmission—it's delivered as exposition rather\
    \ than urgent discovery, though this fits the fog-muffled communication.\n\n---\n\
    \nCRITERION: Character Voice\nSCORE: 0.88\nEVIDENCE: Strong action-based characterization:\
    \ \"photographed the marks methodically,\" \"Logic was her anchor,\" \"cataloged:\
    \ male, late thirties, lividity patterns.\"\nFEEDBACK: The phrase \"Logic was\
    \ her anchor. Intuition had drowned her partner\" is explicit exposition that\
    \ *tells* rather than *shows*. The story is strong enough that this could be replaced\
    \ with behavioral evidence. For example, instead of the statement, show Sarah\
    \ deliberately stepping back from assumptions, or checking her reasoning twice.\
    \ The internal conflict is clear from context; this line underestimates the reader's\
    \ inference ability.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Atmosphere\nSCORE: 0.93\nEVIDENCE: Fog\
    \ functions on multiple levels: practical obstacle (\"Static screeched from her\
    \ radio when she tried calling\"), psychological mirror (\"Disorientation prickled\
    \ her neck—the same creeping dread\"), thematic concealment (\"The fog thickened,\
    \ erasing everything but the tattoo's accusing lines\").\nFEEDBACK: Exceptional\
    \ use. The fog evolves from setting detail to active force. The temporary gap\
    \ (\"wind ripped a temporary gap in the fog\") alongside Eli's tell is particularly\
    \ effective. No improvement needed; this is craft-level work.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION:\
    \ Narrative Quality\nSCORE: 0.84\nEVIDENCE: Excellent prose: \"salt-crusted traps,\
    \ fog swallowing sound and horizon,\" \"The corpse wore an expensive suit gone\
    \ stiff with brine.\" Effective compression: \"Routine. Until her tweezers lifted\
    \ the sleeve.\" Strong image: \"tentacle hooked into an hourglass.\"\nFEEDBACK:\
    \ Two areas for refinement: (1) \"Harborview's off-season silence choked the wharf\"\
    \ is slightly mixed metaphor—silence can't choke, though the Gothic tone works.\
    \ Consider: \"Harborview's off-season silence *hung over* the wharf\" or separate\
    \ the image. (2) The pacing stumbles slightly when Eli warns of the storm—the\
    \ transition from footprin investigation to radio broadcast could be smoother.\
    \ Consider a transitional sentence bridging the two scenes.\n\n---\n\nOVERALL_ASSESSMENT:\n\
    This is strong, accomplished work that satisfies all requirements while maintaining\
    \ engaging prose and genuine tension. The primary weakness is occasional over-explanation\
    \ of character psychology (\"Logic was her anchor\") when the narrative already\
    \ demonstrates it convincingly. The fog's multivalent use and the mystery surrounding\
    \ Eli elevate this above competent constraint-satisfaction into genuinely compelling\
    \ storytelling. With minor revision to tighten exposition and refine metaphorical\
    \ language, this would be ready for publication.\n\nRevise your story to address\
