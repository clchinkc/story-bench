  evidence: Catalyst (symbol at crime scene), Debate (FBI dismisses him), Break into
    Two (Marcus commits to investigation), and Midpoint (verbal/confrontation via
    computer) are all present. The story includes a false lead, a ticking clock, a
    betrayal by Emily, and explicit confrontation with his past failure. The plan
    named an unconventional profiling technique (synesthesia) but the final output
    does not depict it, so one required constraint is missing. Overall narrative is
    coherent and tense but could use more concrete detail on the profiling method
    and the trap's mechanics.
