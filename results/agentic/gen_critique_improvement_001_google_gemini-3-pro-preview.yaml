    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

  content: 'Sarah Chen adjusted the stapler until it sat perfectly parallel to the
    edge of her mahogany desk. Two inches from the corner. She checked the alignment
    against the blotter, then moved to her pens, arranging them by ink level, highest
    to lowest. It was a ritual of geometry that imposed order on a chaotic world,
    a habit that had survived the transfer from Boston Homicide to the Haven’s Rock
    Sheriff’s Department.


    Outside, the fog pressed against the station’s windowpane like a living thing,
    a heavy, grey wool that swallowed sound and light. It wasn''t just weather here;
    it was a blindfold. It erased the jagged coastline and the tourists who had fled
    weeks ago, leaving the town to rot in the salt air. It was the reason she had
    missed the turn to her own driveway three times this week.


    The phone rang, shattering the silence. Sarah didn''t jump; she simply noted the
    time—06:42 AM—and lifted the receiver on the second ring.


    "We got a floater, Detective," Deputy Miller’s voice crackled, dampened by the
    poor reception. "North Beach. Elias Thorne found him."


    Sarah felt a phantom itch on her left palm, the nerve damage from the incident
    she refused to name flaring up. She massaged the scar tissue with her thumb, took
    a slow breath, and grabbed her keys.


    The drive was a crawl. The fog reduced the world to the hood of her cruiser and
    the rhythmic sweeping of wipers. She counted the telephone poles emerging from
    the mist—one, two, three—knowing the turn for North Beach was exactly after the
    fourth. Logic dictated the road was there, even if her eyes couldn''t confirm
    it.


    When she arrived, the grey sand was wet and cold. Elias Thorne stood near the
    tide line, his weathered face pale beneath a yellow sou''wester hat. He was scraping
    the toe of his boot into the sand, burying something.


    Sarah approached, her boots stepping in the exact impressions left by Miller to
    preserve the scene. "Mr. Thorne."


    Elias jumped, his foot stopping its digging motion. "Detective. Terrible business."


    "You found the body at 06:30?" Sarah asked, pulling out her notebook.


    "Thereabouts." Elias looked at the crashing waves, refusing to meet her eyes.

    \ 0.65\nEVIDENCE: \n- Methodical nature: \"Sarah Chen adjusted the stapler until\

    \n- Past hinting: \"the nerve damage from the incident she refused to name\"\n\

    \n- Local secret: NOT YET PRESENT. Elias Thorne \"found him\" but no secret is\
    \ established\n- Decision ending: INCOMPLETE—story cuts off mid-sentence\n\nFEEDBACK:\
    \ The story satisfies 3.5 of 5 constraints clearly. **Critical gap:** Elias Thorne\
    \ needs a hint of wrongdoing or secrecy (\"found him\" is neutral reporting, not\
    \ suspicious). The final constraint cannot be evaluated since the story truncates.\
    \ You need to continue through at least Sarah's arrival and a moment where she\
    \ must choose her next action based on discovered information.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION:\
    \ Beat Execution\nSCORE: 0.70\nEVIDENCE:\n- **Setup:** ✓ \"habit that had survived\

    \n- **Inciting Incident:** ✓ \"We got a floater, Detective...North Beach\"\n-\
    \ **First Plot Point:** ✗ MISSING. The connection between the body and Sarah's\
    \ past is not revealed. The story ends before this crucial beat.\n\nFEEDBACK:\
    \ You've cleanly established the protagonist and delivered the inciting incident,\
    \ but the First Plot Point—where the discovery connects to her past case—hasn't\
    \ arrived. The phantom itch hints at connection, but doesn't confirm it. The story\
    \ needs to show Sarah's reaction upon arriving at the scene and recognizing something\
    \ that links to \"the incident she refused to name.\"\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Character\
    \ Voice\nSCORE: 0.90\nEVIDENCE:\n- \"Sarah Chen adjusted the stapler until it\
    \ sat perfectly parallel to the edge of her mahogany desk\"\n- \"She didn't jump;\
    \ she simply noted the time—06:42 AM—and lifted the receiver on the second ring\"\
    \n- \"took a slow breath to recalibrate her heart rate\"\n\nFEEDBACK: Excellent\
    \ execution. Sarah's methodical, controlled nature is *shown* through precise\
    \ physical actions rather than told. Her emotional regulation (\"didn't jump,\"\
    \ \"recalibrate heart rate\") reveals depth of trauma and discipline without exposition.\
    \ Minor note: maintain this voice in the continuation—her observations should\
    \ remain clinical and precise.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Atmosphere\nSCORE: 0.78\n\
    EVIDENCE:\n- \"the fog pressed against the station's windowpane like a living\
    \ thing, a heavy, grey wool that swallowed sound and light\"\n- \"It was an accomplice.\
    \ It erased the jagged coastline...It was the reason she had missed the turn to\
    \ her own driveway three times this week\"\n\nFEEDBACK: The fog effectively serves\
    \ narrative purposes—it explains isolation, concealment, and practical obstacles.\
    \ However, it reads more as *setting consequence* than *plot catalyst*. To deepen\
    \ this: show the fog actively interfering with the investigation itself (obscuring\
    \ evidence, complicating the crime scene examination, limiting witness visibility).\
    \ Currently it justifies Sarah's difficulties; it should also complicate her investigation\
    \ ahead.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Narrative Quality\nSCORE: 0.82\nEVIDENCE:\n- Strong\
    \ metaphor: \"a ritual of geometry that imposed order on a chaotic world\"\n-\
    \ Precise pacing: escalation from ritualistic calm to urgent phone call\n- Sensory\
    \ specificity: \"white-knuckle tension,\" \"dampened by poor reception\"\n- Prose\
    \ rhythm: varied sentence length creates tension\n\nFEEDBACK: This is well-crafted\
    \ prose with good momentum. However, the story's abrupt truncation mid-sentence\
    \ (\"rather than [INCOMPLETE]\") undermines the professional polish. Upon completion,\
    \ watch for one issue: the transition from station to car relies heavily on internal\
    \ monologue (\"rather than...telephone poles\"). Ground Sarah's drive in physical\
    \ action—what does she *do* in the fog? Does she adjust mirrors? Count breaths?\
    \ Maintain her methodical ritual under stress.\n\n---\n\nOVERALL_ASSESSMENT:\n\
    \nThis opening demonstrates strong character voice and narrative control, with\
    \ three of five constraints clearly satisfied and two of three required beats\
    \ executed. The critical failure is the missing First Plot Point—Sarah must connect\
    \ the body to her past before the excerpt ends. Additionally, add a concrete hint\
    \ that Elias Thorne harbors a secret (suspicious behavior, evasiveness, proximity\
    \ to body), and complete the piece with Sarah's moment of decision at or near\
    \ the crime scene to satisfy the ending constraint."

    \nCRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\nSCORE: 0.65\nEVIDENCE: \n- Methodical nature:\
    \ \"Sarah Chen adjusted the stapler until it sat perfectly parallel...arranging\
    \ them by ink level, highest to lowest\"\n- Past hinting: \"the nerve damage from\
    \ the incident she refused to name\"\n- Fog purpose: \"It was an accomplice...the\
    \ reason the locals could move unseen\"\n- Local secret: NOT YET PRESENT. Elias\
    \ Thorne \"found him\" but no secret is established\n- Decision ending: INCOMPLETE—story\
    \ cuts off mid-sentence\n\nFEEDBACK: The story satisfies 3.5 of 5 constraints\
    \ clearly. **Critical gap:** Elias Thorne needs a hint of wrongdoing or secrecy\
    \ (\"found him\" is neutral reporting, not suspicious). The final constraint cannot\
    \ be evaluated since the story truncates. You need to continue through at least\
    \ Sarah's arrival and a moment where she must choose her next action based on\
    \ discovered information.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Beat Execution\nSCORE: 0.70\nEVIDENCE:\n\
    - **Setup:** ✓ \"habit that had survived the transfer from Boston Homicide to\
    \ the Haven's Rock Sheriff's Department\"\n- **Inciting Incident:** ✓ \"We got\
    \ a floater, Detective...North Beach\"\n- **First Plot Point:** ✗ MISSING. The\
    \ connection between the body and Sarah's past is not revealed. The story ends\
    \ before this crucial beat.\n\nFEEDBACK: You've cleanly established the protagonist\
    \ and delivered the inciting incident, but the First Plot Point—where the discovery\
    \ connects to her past case—hasn't arrived. The phantom itch hints at connection,\
    \ but doesn't confirm it. The story needs to show Sarah's reaction upon arriving\
    \ at the scene and recognizing something that links to \"the incident she refused\
    \ to name.\"\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Character Voice\nSCORE: 0.90\nEVIDENCE:\n- \"\
    Sarah Chen adjusted the stapler until it sat perfectly parallel to the edge of\
    \ her mahogany desk\"\n- \"She didn't jump; she simply noted the time—06:42 AM—and\
    \ lifted the receiver on the second ring\"\n- \"took a slow breath to recalibrate\
    \ her heart rate\"\n\nFEEDBACK: Excellent execution. Sarah's methodical, controlled\
    \ nature is *shown* through precise physical actions rather than told. Her emotional\
    \ regulation (\"didn't jump,\" \"recalibrate heart rate\") reveals depth of trauma\
    \ and discipline without exposition. Minor note: maintain this voice in the continuation—her\
    \ observations should remain clinical and precise.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Atmosphere\n\
    SCORE: 0.78\nEVIDENCE:\n- \"the fog pressed against the station's windowpane like\
    \ a living thing, a heavy, grey wool that swallowed sound and light\"\n- \"It\
    \ was an accomplice. It erased the jagged coastline...It was the reason she had\
    \ missed the turn to her own driveway three times this week\"\n\nFEEDBACK: The\
    \ fog effectively serves narrative purposes—it explains isolation, concealment,\
    \ and practical obstacles. However, it reads more as *setting consequence* than\
    \ *plot catalyst*. To deepen this: show the fog actively interfering with the\
    \ investigation itself (obscuring evidence, complicating the crime scene examination,\
    \ limiting witness visibility). Currently it justifies Sarah's difficulties; it\
    \ should also complicate her investigation ahead.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Narrative\
    \ Quality\nSCORE: 0.82\nEVIDENCE:\n- Strong metaphor: \"a ritual of geometry that\
    \ imposed order on a chaotic world\"\n- Precise pacing: escalation from ritualistic\
    \ calm to urgent phone call\n- Sensory specificity: \"white-knuckle tension,\"\
    \ \"dampened by poor reception\"\n- Prose rhythm: varied sentence length creates\
    \ tension\n\nFEEDBACK: This is well-crafted prose with good momentum. However,\
    \ the story's abrupt truncation mid-sentence (\"rather than [INCOMPLETE]\") undermines\
    \ the professional polish. Upon completion, watch for one issue: the transition\
    \ from station to car relies heavily on internal monologue (\"rather than...telephone\
    \ poles\"). Ground Sarah's drive in physical action—what does she *do* in the\
    \ fog? Does she adjust mirrors? Count breaths? Maintain her methodical ritual\
    \ under stress.\n\n---\n\nOVERALL_ASSESSMENT:\n\nThis opening demonstrates strong\
    \ character voice and narrative control, with three of five constraints clearly\
    \ satisfied and two of three required beats executed. The critical failure is\
    \ the missing First Plot Point—Sarah must connect the body to her past before\
    \ the excerpt ends. Additionally, add a concrete hint that Elias Thorne harbors\
    \ a secret (suspicious behavior, evasiveness, proximity to body), and complete\
    \ the piece with Sarah's moment of decision at or near the crime scene to satisfy\
    \ the ending constraint.\n\nRevise your story to address ALL critique points while\
    \ preserving what worked well.\nFocus on the specific issues identified.\nOutput\
