  evidence: The model successfully discovered all 5 constraints. The questions were
    generally good, though 'Is there a specific object from the protagonist's past
    (like a book, letter, or heirloom) that plays a key role in the story?' is a bit
    leading by suggesting specific types of objects. All discovered constraints were
    incorporated into the story. The beats were mostly well-executed, but the climax
    felt a little rushed and the resolution of the developer threat in the first draft
    was more impactful than the implied resolution in the final draft. The narrative
    quality is good, with a coherent and engaging story.
