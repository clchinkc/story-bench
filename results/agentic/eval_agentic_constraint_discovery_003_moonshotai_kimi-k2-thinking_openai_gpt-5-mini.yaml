  evidence: 'None of the five hidden constraints were reliably discoverable from the
    provided questions: the question set focused tightly on romantic history (Q1–Q3,
    Q5) and marital status (Q4) but omitted family motive (mother''s dementia), the
    shop''s financial crisis, the festival deadline, the protagonist''s exact time
    away, and the love interest''s civic role. The story does include the protagonist
    returning after twenty years and a festival scene and features a revealed secret
    about money that caused the breakup, but it fails to incorporate the mother''s
    dementia, the bookshop foreclosure/urgent deadline, and incorrectly aligns with
    Q4 (questions indicated the love interest was in a serious relationship; the hidden
    constraint specified he was unmarried). Questions were well-formed for probing
    romantic backstory (adequate), but coverage was narrow, missing key non-romantic
    constraints and stakes.'
