  evidence: 'V0 introduced Elena as a competent administrator but was truncated and
    thin on emotional stakes. V1 made no substantive change. V2 began to annotate
    thinking but still truncated. V3 added a concrete medical thread (spike in ARDS,
    prone positioning) that anchored the plot. The final version preserved Elena''s
    competence, expanded the ARDS detail and crisis scene (code blue, IV insertion),
    introduced Dr. Patel/Rohan through an earned shared crisis, developed ongoing
    interactions (coffee, personal disclosures), and moved Elena toward an internal
    transformation (loosening armor) while ending ambiguously. Improvements: greater
    specificity, stronger emotional stakes, and clearer arc. Minor issues: the friendship
    is somewhat brisk though grounded by the crisis, and stray drafting artifact (<think>)
    remains in the text.'
