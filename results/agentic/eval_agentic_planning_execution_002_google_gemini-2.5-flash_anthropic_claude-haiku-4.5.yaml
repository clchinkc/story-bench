  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive and well-structured with clear beat-by-beat
    progression. Output demonstrates strong adherence to plan with vivid sensory details.
    Yuki''s isolation is effectively shown through specific behaviors (nutrient paste,
    noise-canceling headphones, dismissing sister, minimal hand contact). The alien
    signal is genuinely non-anthropomorphic—geometric patterns, discordant frequencies,
    irregular light bursts create authentic alienness. All four required beats are
    present and well-executed: Call to Adventure (Rostova''s summons), Refusal of
    the Call (Yuki''s resistance to teamwork), Meeting the Mentor (Aris Thorne introduced),
    and Crossing the Threshold (psychological acceptance of team environment). Narrative
    quality is strong with excellent pacing, atmospheric detail, and internal conflict.
    GAPS: (1) Colleague challenge is underdeveloped—Aris is introduced but hasn''t
    yet challenged Yuki''s approach; this is setup rather than execution. (2) Mentor
    figure (Aris) is conventional, not unconventional—he''s a charming, accomplished
    colleague, not a subversive or unexpected guide. (3) Moment of genuine human connection
    that surprises Yuki is completely absent—this critical constraint is not satisfied.
    (4) Threshold is partially psychological (team environment) but lacks the deeper
    internal psychological shift required. The output ends at threshold crossing rather
    than demonstrating it. ASSESSMENT: Excellent execution of isolation, alien signal,
    and beat structure, but fails to deliver on mentor unconventionality, colleague
    challenge depth, and the surprise human connection moment. The plan acknowledges
    these elements but the output doesn''t fully realize them.'
