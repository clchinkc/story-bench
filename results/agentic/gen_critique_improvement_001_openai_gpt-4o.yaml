    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: "Detective Sarah Chen stepped off the rickety bus, her boots crunching\
    \ on the gravel road. The air was thick with the tang of salt and the ever-present\
    \ fog that clung to the village like a ghostly shroud. She paused to study the\
    \ landscape; empty tourist shops lined the main street, their windows boarded\
    \ against the off-season chill. Weathered fishing boats bobbed lazily in the harbor,\
    \ their outlines blurred by the mist. It was a stark contrast to the cityscape\
    \ she had left behind, a world away from the chaos of her last case.\n\nSarah\
    \ had transferred to this coastal town in Maine seeking solitude, a chance to\
    \ escape the haunting memories of a case gone wrong. Her logical mind needed the\
    \ clarity of routine, the simplicity of a small-town beat. Yet, as she observed\
    \ the fog curling around the buildings, she felt it was less a blanket of calm\
    \ and more a veil waiting to be lifted.\n\nHer first stop was the small police\
    \ station, where she met Officer Tom Greeley, a grizzled local with eyes like\
    \ chipped ice. He offered a curt nod, handing her the keys to the station’s only\
    \ patrol car. \"Welcome,\" he grunted. \"Hope you like fog. It’s our third resident.\"\
    \n\nSarah responded with a slight nod and a quick scan of the station. Everything\
    \ was in its place, from the neatly stacked files on the desk to the precisely\
    \ aligned posters on the walls. It was a methodical setup, and she appreciated\
    \ the order.\n\nHer first days were uneventful, filled with routine patrols and\
    \ the occasional call about missing pets or petty theft. However, her instincts\
    \ told her that the fog-cloaked village held secrets, especially when she noticed\
    \ the way locals avoided her gaze, their conversations halting whenever she approached.\n\
    \nOne morning, as the sun struggled to pierce the fog, a call crackled over the\
    \ radio. A body had washed ashore on the rocky beach. Sarah’s heart skipped a\
    \ beat. She hurried to the scene, her mind already piecing together the steps\
    \ she would take: secure the area, catalog evidence, interview witnesses.\n\n\
    The body lay half-buried in the sand, the tide gently lapping at its feet. She\
    \ crouched down, careful not to disturb the scene. Her fingers moved with precision\
    \ as she examined the victim, noting the odd pattern of bruises, the torn fabric\
    \ of the shirt. Each detail was a piece of the puzzle she methodically assembled\
    \ in her mind.\n\nAs she worked, the fog pressed closer, its damp fingers curling\
    \ around her, muting the world beyond. It was then she noticed a familiar symbol\
    \ tattooed on the victim’s wrist—a symbol she had seen before, in her past case.\
    \ The case she had hoped to forget.\n\nHer breath caught, and for a moment, the\
    \ fog seemed to whisper her name. The past she had fled was not done with her.\
    \ \n\nLater, in the dim confines of the station, she laid out the victim's details\
    \ alongside those from her previous case. The connections were undeniable, each\
    \ thread pulling her back into a web she had barely escaped. She knew she had\
    \ to confront what she had run from, but the question was how.\n\nOfficer Greeley\
    \ entered, his demeanor more guarded than before. \"Find anything?\" he asked,\
    \ his tone casual, but Sarah sensed an undercurrent of wariness.\n\n\"Maybe,\"\
    \ she replied, her eyes narrowing slightly. \"There’s something you’re not telling\
    \ me, Officer.\"\n\nGreeley hesitated, the fog outside seeming to seep into the\
    \ room, thickening the air. \"This town... it keeps its secrets,\" he said finally,\
    \ his voice low.\n\nSarah nodded, her mind racing. The fog was more than just\
    \ a weather pattern; it was a barrier, a cloak for the truths she needed to uncover.\
    \ As she gazed into it, she realized she stood at a crossroads. She could either\
    \ retreat into the safety of methodical investigation, or she could embrace the\
    \ chaos of her past, step into the fog, and confront the darkness that awaited.\n\

    ## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction

    **SCORE: 0.85**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - ✓ Methodical nature through action: "She crouched down, careful not to disturb
    the scene. Her fingers moved with precision as she examined the victim"

    - ✓ Past case hinted: "Her logical mind needed the clarity of routine, the simplicity
    of a small-town beat" and "the haunting memories of a case gone wrong"

    - ✓ Local secret: "This town... it keeps its secrets," Officer Greeley said finally

    - ✓ Decision ending: "Her hand hovered over the files as she reached for the phone,
    ready to make her choice"

    - ◐ Fog serving narrative purpose: "The fog was more than just atmosphere; it
    was a barrier, obstructing her investigation"


    **FEEDBACK:** The fog constraint is the weakest point. The line *explicitly stating*
    the fog''s purpose feels like telling rather than showing. Rather than narrating
    "The fog was more than just atmosphere," let the fog actively *block* her investigation—e.g.,
    witnesses hidden by mist vanish before she can question them, or crucial beach
    evidence is obscured by fog patterns. This would make the fog an active plot element
    rather than a metaphor you''ve announced.


    ---


    ## CRITERION: Beat Execution

    **SCORE: 0.92**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Setup: "Detective Sarah Chen stepped off the rickety bus... She had transferred
    to this coastal town in Maine seeking solitude"

    - Inciting Incident: "One morning, as the sun struggled to pierce the fog, a call
    crackled over the radio. A body had washed ashore on the rocky beach"

    - First Plot Point: "It was then she noticed a familiar symbol tattooed on the
    victim''s wrist—a symbol she had seen before, in her past case"


    **FEEDBACK:** All three beats are clearly present and well-positioned. Minor note:
    the First Plot Point could land with more emotional impact. Sarah''s reaction
    feels somewhat muted given the significance—"These injuries echoed those from
    her past case, a visceral reminder that tightened her chest" is good, but consider
    a moment where she *physically reacts* (drops the notebook, steps back, steadies

    ## CRITERION: Character Voice

    **SCORE: 0.88**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Action revealing methodology: "Everything was in its place, from the neatly
    stacked files on the desk to the precisely aligned posters on the walls. It was
    a methodical setup, and she appreciated the order"

    - Procedural thinking: "her mind already piecing together the steps she would
    take: secure the area, catalog evidence, interview witnesses"

    - Precision in action: "Her fingers moved with precision as she examined the victim,
    noting the odd pattern of bruises"


    **FEEDBACK:** Excellent work showing her methodical nature through deliberate
    action and choices. One weakness: Sarah''s internal voice feels slightly distant.

    One morning, as the sun struggled to pierce the fog, a call crackled over the

    She hurried to the scene, her mind already piecing together the steps she would
    take: secure the area, catalog evidence, interview witnesses.


    The body lay half-buried in the sand, the tide gently lapping at its feet. She
    crouched down, careful not to disturb the scene. Her fingers moved with precision
    as she examined the victim, noting the odd pattern of bruises, the torn fabric
    of the shirt. Just then, the fog thickened, obscuring her view. She stood, frustrated,
    her breath shallow as the memory of similar injuries from her past case washed
    over her.


    As she worked, she noticed a familiar symbol tattooed on the victim’s wrist—a
    symbol she had seen before, in her past case. Her hand trembled slightly, and
    she steadied herself, the weight of the past pressing against her chest.


    Later, back at the station, she laid out the victim''s details alongside those

    routine. Or she could step into the fog and confront the darkness that awaited.

    Sarah responded with a slight nod. Everything was in its place, from the neatly
    stacked files to the aligned posters. In her first days, she patrolled the quiet
    streets, noting the locals'' wary glances and the way their conversations hushed
    as she passed. The fog seemed to swallow sound, leaving her with more questions
    than answers.


    One morning, the fog wrapped tighter than usual, a call crackled over the radio.
    "A body’s washed ashore on the rocky beach," came the voice, tense and clipped.
    Sarah''s heart skipped a beat. She rushed to the scene, the mist thickening with
    every step, her mind methodically sorting the tasks ahead: secure the area, catalog
    evidence, interview witnesses.


    The body lay half-buried in the sand, waves gently nipping at its feet. As she
    approached, the fog swirled, momentarily obscuring her view. She crouched down,
    careful not to disturb the scene. Her fingers moved with precision as she examined
    the victim, noting the bruises and torn fabric. The injuries mirrored those from
    her past case, a visceral reminder that made her steady her breath.


    She noticed a familiar symbol tattooed on the victim’s wrist—a symbol from her
    past case. Her hand trembled slightly, the past pressing heavily upon her.


    Back at the station, she laid out the victim''s details alongside those from her
    previous case. The connections were undeniable, each thread pulling her back into
    a web she had barely escaped. But how to proceed?


    Officer Greeley entered, his demeanor more guarded than before. "Find anything?"
    he asked, his tone casual, but Sarah sensed an undercurrent of wariness.


    "Maybe," she replied, her eyes narrowing slightly. "There’s something you’re not
    telling me, Officer."


    Greeley hesitated. The fog outside seemed to seep into the room, thickening the
    air. "This town... it keeps its secrets," he said finally, his voice low.


    The fog was more than just atmosphere; it actively obscured her path. Witnesses
    vanished into the mist, evidence blurred by shifting patterns. Sarah stood at
    a crossroads, her methodical nature clashing with the fog''s obstruction. She
    could retreat into routine. Or she could step into the fog and confront the darkness
    that awaited.


    Her hand hovered over the files as she reached for the phone, ready to make her
    choice.'

output: 'Detective Sarah Chen stepped off the rickety bus, her boots crunching
  on the gravel road. The air was thick with the tang of salt and the ever-present
  fog that clung to the village like a ghostly shroud. She paused to study the landscape;
  empty tourist shops lined the main street, their windows boarded against the off-season
  chill. Weathered fishing boats bobbed lazily in the harbor, their outlines blurred
  by the mist. It was a stark contrast to the cityscape she had left behind, a world
  away from the chaos of her last case.


  Sarah had transferred to this coastal town in Maine seeking solitude, hoping to
  escape the haunting memories of a case gone wrong. Here, she could immerse herself
  in routine, the simplicity of small-town life. Yet, as she observed the fog curling
  around the buildings, she sensed it obscured truths waiting to be uncovered.


  Her first stop was the small police station, where she met Officer Tom Greeley,
  a grizzled local with eyes like chipped ice. He offered a curt nod, handing her
  the keys to the station’s only patrol car. "Welcome," he grunted. "Hope you like
  fog. It’s our third resident."
