  evidence: The questions successfully discovered 4 out of 5 constraints. The 'mother
    has early-stage dementia' constraint was not discoverable. The questions were
    strategic and well-formed, covering protagonist's past, relationships, and reasons
    for return. However, the questions did not touch upon the mother's health or the
    bookshop's financial situation. The final output incorporated the discovered constraints
    about the complicated past romantic relationship, the protagonist's return due
    to family obligation (father's heart attack instead of mother's dementia, which
    was not discovered), and the protagonist's avoidance of commitment. The 'bookshop
    facing foreclosure' and 'autumn festival last chance' constraints were not discovered
    and thus not incorporated. The narrative quality is decent, but the ending feels
    a bit rushed and cliché, and the 'family obligation' was slightly altered from
    the hidden constraint.
