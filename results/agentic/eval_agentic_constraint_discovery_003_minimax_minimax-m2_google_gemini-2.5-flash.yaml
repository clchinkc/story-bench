  evidence: No questions were asked, so no constraints were discoverable or satisfied.
    The narrative completely missed all hidden constraints. The protagonist's reason
    for returning is a father's heart attack, not a mother's dementia. The former
    fiance is David Morrison, not the mayor. There's no mention of the bookshop facing
    foreclosure or the autumn festival being the last chance to save it. The story
    is a generic romance plot, not aligned with the specific constraints.
