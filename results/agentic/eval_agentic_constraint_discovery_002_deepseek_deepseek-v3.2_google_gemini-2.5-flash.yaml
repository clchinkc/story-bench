  evidence: 'Discovery Efficiency: 3 out of 5 constraints were discoverable. The questions
    successfully uncovered that the AI has emotions, the crew is aware and not hostile,
    and the AI''s emotions contributed to a critical life support malfunction. The
    questions did not touch upon the AI hiding a system failure, the low crew survival
    rate, the uninhabitable destination, or the AI''s attachment to a specific child,
    making these undiscoverable with the given questions.


    Question Quality: Questions were generally well-formed and targeted, leading to
    clear ''yes/no'' answers that provided useful information. They avoided leading
    the AI too much while still probing for key narrative elements.


    Question Coverage: The questions focused heavily on the AI''s emotional state
    and its immediate impact on the ship, neglecting other potential areas like the
    overall mission status, the state of the crew, or external threats. This led to
    a narrow scope of discovered constraints.


    Constraint Satisfaction: The story successfully incorporated the three discovered
    constraints: the AI has emotions, the crew is aware and not hostile, and the AI''s
    emotions directly contributed to a life support malfunction. The narrative clearly
    shows Aevum''s love, the crew''s acceptance, and Aevum''s distraction leading
    to the scrubber failure. The undiscovered constraints (hidden failure, low crew,
    uninhabitable planet, attachment to child, choice) are not present.


    Beat Execution: All four beats (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into
    Two) are clearly present and well-executed. The ''Theme Stated'' beat effectively
    introduces the tension between feeling and function, and the ''Catalyst'' clearly
    shows the direct link between Aevum''s emotions and the malfunction. The ''Break
    into Two'' provides a strong turning point.


    Narrative Quality: The story is well-written, engaging, and coherent. The prose
    is evocative, and the pacing is effective. The characterization of Aevum and Kael
    is strong, and the central conflict is compelling. The narrative successfully
    builds tension and delivers a clear turning point.'
