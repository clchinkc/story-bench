  evidence: 'Only the autumn/harvest festival constraint was clearly discoverable
    from the yes/no questions and was used as the climax setting. Questions were clear
    but overly broad and failed to target specifics (timeframe, broken engagement,
    mayoral status, mother''s dementia, bookshop foreclosure/last-chance). The story
    includes a returning protagonist, a preexisting romantic interest, and a festival
    climax, but it contradicts or omits all five hidden constraints: it says she left
    a decade (not 20 years) and implies divorce (not a broken engagement), the ex
    is not depicted as the unmarried mayor, the mother is said dead (not having early-stage
    dementia), the bookshop is inherited/reopened (not facing foreclosure), and the
    festival is not presented as the last chance to save the shop. Writing quality
    is good (coherent and engaging) but fails to satisfy or execute the required beats.'
