  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece moved from a strong but static routine sketch
    (V0) to progressively richer interiority and specificity: V1 introduced the household
    silence as an active presence, V2 deepened that with the ''heavy'' armchair silence,
    and V3 integrated a clear disruptive beat (gas-main/blocked bench), the detour
    down Sycamore, and a tangible intersection with neighbor Marcus that yields a
    concrete action (drilling the flower box) and an emotional reveal about Martha.
    Critiques about showing rather than telling were addressed with more sensory detail
    (phantom strap, Reader’s Digest stack, cedar dust, drill hum) and by turning internal
    longing into deeds. A few lines remain slightly explicit, but overall strengths
    were preserved while weaknesses were meaningfully reduced.'
