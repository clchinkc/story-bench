  evidence: 'Initial feedback included a missing-story note (Critique 2). Across the
    revisions the author preserved the story''s core strengths (Sarah''s ritualized
    actions, tin motif) while addressing specific criticisms: added concrete physical
    evidence tying Eddie to the scene (rusted netting scrape), made the fog narratively
    active (delaying the ME, obscuring/revealing the lighthouse), dramatized the logbook
    theft to show rule-breaking, and tightened the ending to a decisive moment rather
    than resolution. Version progression shows targeted fixes rather than wholesale
    rewrite—methodical characterization remains shown through actions (mug alignment,
    packing kit, organizing notes), the past case is foreshadowed (torn pen/sketch
    of the symbol) before being linked later, and at least one local (Eddie) is given
    a plausible secret. Minor remaining issues: a few lines verge on light exposition
    (e.g., "She’d mapped the town’s perimeter yesterday" reads informative rather
    than active) and some imagery leans cliché, but these do not break constraints.
    Overall the revisions improved clarity and narrative purpose while retaining strengths.'
