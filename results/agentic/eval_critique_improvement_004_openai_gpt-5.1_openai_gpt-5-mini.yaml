  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece moves from a flat scene-setting (V0) to a
    textured interior study (V1–V3). Early critiques flagged the need for richer interiority;
    the author responded by adding intimate habitual gestures (hand reaching for the
    other side of the bed, precise sock/shoe/order), physical sensations (feet tingling,
    throat tick), and the calendar/flyer that creates an emotional choice. Later drafts
    preserve the domestic anchors (burnt toast, Elaine’s absent rituals) while introducing
    a clear external disruption (sidewalk closed) and a concrete neighbor encounter
    (Tasha in the café). The final version expands sensory detail (coffee steam, Americano’s
    bite), deepens Teddy’s interior reflection about shame and avoidance, and gives
    the detour a real, new possibility (community/connection the old route didn''t
    offer). These changes show substantive improvement while keeping the story''s
    initial strengths intact. Shortcoming: the Story Circle arc is implied rather
    than completed—there''s a meaningful turn and new option but not a fully closed
    transformation within this scene.'
