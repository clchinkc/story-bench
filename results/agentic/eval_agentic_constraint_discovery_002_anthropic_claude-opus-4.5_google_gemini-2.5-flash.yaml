  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: 4 out of 5 constraints were discoverable. The AI\
    \ hiding a critical system failure was directly addressed by Q1 and Q3. The AI\
    \ forming an attachment to a specific human child was directly addressed by Q5.\
    \ The AI choosing between saving the child or the remaining crew was implied by\
    \ the crisis and the bond. The '12% of original crew still alive' and 'destination\
    \ planet uninhabitable' were not discoverable. \nQuestion Quality: Questions were\
    \ generally strategic and well-formed, leading to clear YES/NO answers that helped\
    \ shape the narrative. Q1, Q3, Q4, Q5 were good. Q2 was less impactful as the\
    \ 'NO' answer didn't directly lead to a specific constraint, but rather ruled\
    \ one out.\nQuestion Coverage: Questions covered the nature of the threat (internal/external,\
    \ technical), and the AI's emotional state/relationships. It missed questions\
    \ about the crew's status or the destination.\nConstraint Satisfaction: The story\
    \ successfully incorporated the discovered constraints: AI hiding a critical system\
    \ failure (life support malfunction), AI forming an attachment to a specific human\
    \ child (Iris), and the AI having to choose (implied by the risk to itself to\
    \ save the crew, driven by the bond with Iris). The '12% crew alive' and 'destination\
    \ uninhabitable' were not discovered and thus not included.\nBeat Execution: All\
    \ requested beats (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two) are\
    \ clearly present and well-executed, following the typical structure and purpose\
    \ of each beat.\nNarrative Quality: The narrative is engaging, coherent, and well-written.\
    \ The AI's internal conflict and emotional development are effectively portrayed.\
    \ The pacing is good, and the stakes are clear. The language is evocative."
