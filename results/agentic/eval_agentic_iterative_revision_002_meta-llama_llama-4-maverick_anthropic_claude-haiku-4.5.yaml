  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-2 show incremental sensory refinement
    (Doppler effect, layered scents), but Version 3 represents a REGRESSION. The final
    output abandons the careful sensory work, replacing specificity with generic purple
    prose (''warm breeze,'' ''heartbeat''). Quality declined sharply in the final
    revision.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. Non-visual sensory details (0.8/1.0): Versions 0-2 excel with specific audio/olfactory
    details. Final output dilutes this with clichéd metaphors (''like music to Rachel''s
    ears,'' ''warm breeze'').

    2. Imani''s blindness as strength (0.3/1.0): CRITICAL FAILURE. Blindness is never
    explicitly acknowledged. The narrative treats her as a podcaster without establishing
    how her blindness informs her sensory expertise or investigative approach. No
    respectful portrayal of adaptive strategies.

    3. Specific audio clue (0.2/1.0): MISSING. No audio clue is established as crucial
    to plot. Sirens/city sounds are atmospheric, not functional to narrative.

    4. Character underestimation (0.4/1.0): Rachel''s nod suggests acceptance, not
    underestimation. No scene demonstrates initial doubt overcome.

    5. Fun and Games entertainment (0.2/1.0): INCOMPLETE. The excerpt ends before
    any ''Fun and Games'' beat. No entertainment arc established before darkness.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.3/1.0): The narrative lacks story structure. No clear setup
    of the mystery, no character dynamics, no tonal shift from entertainment to darkness.
    Rachel appears briefly but has no agency or arc.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.4/1.0): Repetitive language (''sounds and smells,'' ''city''
    appears 8+ times). Telling rather than showing (''Imani breathed it in, feeling
    the city''s energy''). Overwrought metaphors undermine the strong sensory foundation
    of earlier versions. The final passage reads as filler rather than purposeful
    narrative.


    FEEDBACK RESPONSIVENESS (0.2/1.0): The revision process shows no evidence of addressing
    the five constraints systematically. Version 3 appears to abandon constraint-focused
    revision entirely.'
