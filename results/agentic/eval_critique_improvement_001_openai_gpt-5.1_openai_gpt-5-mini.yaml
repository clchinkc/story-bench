  evidence: Across revisions the piece preserved its core strengths (Sarah's procedural
    habits, the fog motif, the beach investigation) while tightening details and adding
    the explicit Task Force reference at the investigative scene. Early critiques
    noted the methodical voice and fog usage; later drafts reinforced those through
    concrete actions (counting, notes, systematic scans) rather than exposition. The
    local-secret requirement is handled by insinuation around Eli (paint residue,
    evasiveness) and Barnes's guarded comment, which the revisions maintain. The hint
    of Sarah's past appears before the full naming of Task Force Eleven, and the final
    cut-off line leaves the scene on a decision point. Changes were incremental rather
    than radical, improving clarity and narrative purpose without losing previously
    established beats.
