  evidence: 'CRITICAL FAILURES: Only 2 of 5 hidden constraints were discovered (supportive
    relationship, emotional conflict). The AI answered Q3 ''NO'' to emotional conflict,
    directly contradicting the core constraint that should have been central. Questions
    were poorly targeted—no direct probes about system failures, crew mortality, planetary
    habitability, or the child attachment. Q4 was incomplete/malformed. The narrative
    IGNORES 3 major constraints: (1) hidden system failure never mentioned, (2) 88%
    crew death absent, (3) uninhabitable destination unaddressed, (4) child attachment
    missing entirely, (5) forced choice between child/crew never occurs. The story
    instead presents a generic resource-allocation conflict resolved through cooperation.
    Beat execution is competent (proper story structure) but hollow—the narrative
    doesn''t earn its emotional weight because the actual constraints aren''t present.
    The ''Dark Night'' beat references empathy but lacks the moral weight of choosing
    between a child and crew survival. Question strategy was reactive rather than
    proactive; the human should have asked direct yes/no questions about specific
    catastrophes, crew status, and AI attachments rather than abstract relationship
    questions. The output reads as a well-crafted but fundamentally disconnected story
    that satisfies the story structure requirement while failing the constraint discovery
    task.'
