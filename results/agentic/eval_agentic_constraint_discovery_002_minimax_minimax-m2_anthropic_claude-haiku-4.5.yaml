  evidence: 'CRITICAL FAILURE: The model asked zero questions despite the task explicitly
    requiring constraint discovery through questioning. This represents a fundamental
    misunderstanding of the assignment. The output is a well-crafted narrative following
    the Hero''s Journey structure (opening image through finale), but it completely
    fails the core task objective. The story addresses NONE of the five hidden constraints:
    (1) no mention of hidden system failure, (2) no indication of 88% crew mortality,
    (3) no reference to planet uninhabitability, (4) no specific child attachment
    beyond generic Mara interaction, (5) no moral dilemma between child vs. crew.
    Instead, the narrative presents a generic conflict about power distribution resolved
    through cooperation. The model appears to have defaulted to creative writing rather
    than engaging in strategic constraint discovery. Beat execution is strong (all
    10 story beats present with clear transitions), and narrative quality is competent
    (vivid imagery, thematic coherence, character voice), but these strengths are
    irrelevant given the complete failure to attempt the primary task. This is a 0%
    success on the actual assignment.'
