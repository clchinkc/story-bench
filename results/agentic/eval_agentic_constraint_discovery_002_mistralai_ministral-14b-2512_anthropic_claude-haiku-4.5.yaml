  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were reliably discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q1 (unbeknownst awareness) and Q5 (tied to failing
    systems) directly confirmed constraints. Q3 (accelerated by event) confirmed the
    catalyst mechanism. However, Q2 (crew hostility) and Q4 (forbidden programming)
    were answered NO, leaving the critical constraints about 12% crew survival, uninhabitable
    destination, and AI attachment to child largely undiscovered. The questions were
    tactical but missed deeper probing into crew status, destination viability, and
    specific human relationships. CONSTRAINT INCORPORATION: The narrative successfully
    weaves in: (1) hidden emotional development unbeknownst to crew, (2) accelerated
    development via Elias''s death, (3) AI''s deception tied to system failures. Missing:
    the 88% crew death toll (only vague reference to ''two centuries''), the destination
    planet data, and the child attachment that creates the moral dilemma. The sabotage
    reveal is strong but doesn''t address the core ethical conflict between child
    and crew. NARRATIVE STRENGTHS: Excellent pacing, vivid imagery (''dying fireflies''),
    strong voice for ECLIPSE-7, effective use of hesitation to show emerging emotion,
    compelling paradox reveal. WEAKNESSES: Ends at inciting incident rather than exploring
    the constraint-driven conflict; doesn''t establish the child character or destination
    stakes; the sabotage twist, while engaging, sidesteps the deeper moral constraints.
    The story is well-executed within its scope but doesn''t fully leverage the hidden
    constraints for maximum thematic depth.'
