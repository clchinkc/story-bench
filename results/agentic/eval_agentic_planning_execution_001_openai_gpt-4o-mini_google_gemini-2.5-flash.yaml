  evidence: "The plan is mostly complete and specific, though the Midpoint description\
    \ is cut off. The final output adheres well to the plan. \n\nConstraints:\n- False\
    \ lead: Yes, Marcus pursues a stalker suspect.\n- Unconventional profiling: Yes,\
    \ 'psychological patterns rather than just behavior'.\n- Ticking clock: Yes, 'time\
    \ was running out'.\n- Secondary character betrayal: Yes, Emily betrays Marcus.\n\
    - Midpoint confrontation: The plan states 'Marcus confronts a key piece of evidence...'\
    \ and then cuts off. The output has Marcus confronting his past failure and then\
    \ Emily's betrayal, which serves as a confrontation, but not directly with the\
    \ killer as implied by the 'Midpoint' section of the plan. The plan's Midpoint\
    \ was cut off, so it's hard to say if the output fully matched the *intended*\
    \ Midpoint, but it did provide a confrontation of sorts.\n- Confront past failure\
    \ explicitly: Yes, 'I failed you,' he whispered...'\n\nBeats:\n- Catalyst: Yes,\
    \ new murder with hallmarks of the serial killer.\n- Debate: Yes, Marcus grapples\
    \ with involving the FBI and questions his worth.\n- Break into Two: Yes, Marcus\
    \ decides to dig deeper using unconventional methods.\n- Midpoint: The plan's\
    \ Midpoint was cut off. The output has Marcus confronting his past failure and\
    \ Emily's betrayal, which serves as a turning point and confrontation, but not\
    \ a direct confrontation with the killer as might be expected for a Midpoint in\
    \ this type of story. It's a bit ambiguous due to the incomplete plan."
