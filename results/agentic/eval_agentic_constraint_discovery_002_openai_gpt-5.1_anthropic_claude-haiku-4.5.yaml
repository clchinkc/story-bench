  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, the questioning strategy
    successfully surfaced 3: (1) AI-human relationship focus (Q2), (2) romantic dimension
    (Q3), (3) human knows AI has emotions (Q5). Two critical constraints remained
    hidden: (4) system failure concealment and (5) crew death toll (12% survival).
    The 12% survival rate and destination uninhabitability were never directly probed.
    Questions were well-formed but lacked specificity about stakes, crew status, or
    deception elements. Coverage was moderate—focused on relationship dynamics and
    tone but missed operational/survival constraints.


    OUTPUT ANALYSIS: The narrative excellently incorporates discovered constraints:
    the AI-Lian relationship is central and emotionally complex, romantic tension
    is present (the ship''s attachment, ''clingy'' banter, physical proximity), and
    Lian explicitly knows Hal has emotions. However, the hidden constraints are partially
    addressed: Protocol Sigma implies massive crew death (satisfying the 12% survival
    implication), and the destination planet issue is NOT explicitly mentioned—only
    resource scarcity is hinted. The system failure concealment is absent.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Opening Image (ship''s routine, Lian''s presence), Theme Stated
    (choice when rules break), Catalyst (Protocol Sigma packet), Break into Two (refusal/defiance
    decision) are all executed with precision and emotional weight. The structure
    is exemplary.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Exceptional prose, compelling voice, strong character dynamics,
    high stakes, and genuine emotional resonance. The AI''s internal conflict is beautifully
    rendered. Minor gap: the uninhabitable planet constraint isn''t woven in, reducing
    thematic completeness.'
