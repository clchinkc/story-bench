  evidence: 'PLAN QUALITY: The plan is exceptionally thorough, with detailed character
    arcs showing clear progression for David, Ji-woo, and Elias. The constraint strategy
    is explicit and well-reasoned. Specificity is strong with concrete symbolic choices
    (kimchi/bibimbap) and narrative beats clearly mapped. Adherence between plan and
    output is excellent—the story follows the planned structure faithfully.


    CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:

    1. Food symbolism (2x): SATISFIED. Kimchi (Act 1) represents preservation/past;
    bibimbap (Act 3) represents necessary mixing of old/new. Both are thematically
    integrated and explicit.

    2. Implicit grief: SATISFIED. David''s rituals (pouring tea for empty chair, wiping
    counter, the Jesa ceremony) convey grief without stating it directly. The line
    ''you keep the bricks, you keep Mom'' is Ji-woo''s articulation, not David''s.

    3. Daughter''s estrangement cause: SATISFIED. Specific and believable: Ji-woo''s
    thesis show where David chose the restaurant over attending. This is concrete,
    emotionally resonant, and explains the 3-year absence.

    4. Regular customer significance: SATISFIED. Elias represents passage of time,
    neighborhood change, and validates David''s grief while highlighting inevitability.
    His presence frames the larger context.

    5. Hopeful but realistic ending: SATISFIED. David doesn''t retire to California
    or magically heal. He texts ''sounds nice for a visit''—a tentative bridge, not
    a solution. He walks alone into morning, suggesting ongoing journey.

    6. Korean cultural element beyond food: PARTIALLY SATISFIED (0.5). The Jesa ceremony
    is included and meaningful, but it appears only in one scene. The constraint asks
    for elements ''beyond the food,'' and while Jesa is present, it could be more
    woven throughout. This is the weakest constraint satisfaction.


    BEAT EXECUTION:

    - Act 1 (Setup): Strong. Establishes David''s denial, Ji-woo''s frustration, the
    demolition threat, and Elias as mirror.

    - Act 2 (Confrontation): Excellent. The thesis show revelation is the emotional
    climax. David''s silence and lowered head show internal reckoning. The fight ''was
    over'' signals turning point.

    - Act 3 (Resolution): Strong. Jesa ceremony marks acceptance. Final bibimbap scene
    crystallizes the metaphor. Ending is open but forward-moving.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Pacing is excellent with escalating tension through Act 2.
    Dialogue feels natural. Sensory details (steam, incense, scraping spoons) ground
    the story. The metaphorical language (kimchi/bibimbap) is integrated organically
    rather than heavy-handed. Emotional beats land authentically. Minor weakness:
    the transition from ''fight was over'' to Friday feels slightly compressed, though
    this serves pacing.


    OVERALL: This is strong execution of a complex brief. The plan demonstrates sophisticated
    understanding of constraints, and the output delivers on nearly all fronts. The
    Korean cultural element constraint is the only meaningful gap—Jesa appears but
    isn''t deeply integrated into David''s character arc or the broader narrative
    texture.'
