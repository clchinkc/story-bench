  evidence: Critique 1 and 2 highlighted issues with the past case, fog's narrative
    purpose, and methodical nature. Version 3 and the final output directly address
    these. The past case is explicitly mentioned ('Blackwood investigation') and then
    linked to Lily's secret. The fog is used to heighten tension and obscure information,
    serving a narrative purpose beyond atmosphere. Sarah's methodical nature is shown
    through detailed actions like photographing the body, noting details, and collecting
    evidence. The final output successfully incorporates all constraints, demonstrating
    a clear improvement trajectory from the initial versions.
