  evidence: 'PLAN ANALYSIS: The plan is comprehensive and well-structured, addressing
    most constraints explicitly. It maps beats clearly (Opening Image, Theme Stated,
    Catalyst implied). Specificity is strong with concrete locations, character details,
    and scene descriptions. ADHERENCE: Output follows plan closely but compresses/combines
    some beats. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) False lead—SATISFIED: David Koh is clearly
    a false lead Marcus pursues obsessively, leading to wrongful interrogation. (2)
    Unconventional profiling—SATISFIED: ''Spatial psychology'' and ''psychological
    geography'' are explicitly used instead of traditional forensics. (3) Ticking
    clock—PARTIALLY SATISFIED: Three-day investigation creates urgency, but clock
    lacks explicit deadline pressure or escalating stakes. (4) Secondary character
    betrayal—SATISFIED: Keisha Williams betrays Marcus by sharing notes with FBI under
    custody pressure. (5) Midpoint confrontation (non-physical)—SATISFIED: David Koh
    confrontation in interrogation room is verbal/psychological, not physical. (6)
    Confront past failure—SATISFIED: Opening establishes Ray Kim/2015 failure; Marcus
    explicitly revisits and acknowledges his mistake with Koh. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening
    Image (strong), Theme Stated (present but brief), Catalyst (implied but not clearly
    marked—package arrival functions as catalyst but lacks formal beat structure),
    Debate (missing—no clear debate beat where Marcus questions his approach), Break
    into Two (implied but not explicit), Midpoint (strong). The narrative lacks a
    clear ''Debate'' beat where Marcus wrestles with whether to pursue the case. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Excellent pacing, atmospheric writing, strong character voice. The twist
    ending (killer deliberately planted false lead) is compelling. Rain motif effective.
    However, the story ends on setup rather than resolution, which works for a teaser
    but leaves narrative arc incomplete.'
