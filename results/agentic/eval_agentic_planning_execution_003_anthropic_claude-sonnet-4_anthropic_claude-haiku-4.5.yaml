  evidence: 'PLAN PHASE: Comprehensive planning document addresses all required elements
    with strong specificity. Character motivations clearly established (Sophie''s
    wedding absence as estrangement cause is concrete and believable). Three acts
    mapped with specific scenes and emotional beats. Food symbolism planned explicitly
    (kimchi as preservation). Mrs. Chen positioned as regular customer representing
    purpose. Korean cultural element (incense ritual) identified. Ending framed as
    hopeful but realistic.


    CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS: (1) Food symbolic use - SATISFIED: Kimchi opening (preservation/fermentation
    of past) and mandu folding (connection/memory) both work symbolically. (2) David''s
    grief implicit - SATISFIED: Wife''s photo, chrysanthemums, recipe journal, incense
    ritual all convey grief without explicit statement. (3) Daughter''s estrangement
    cause - SATISFIED: COVID restaurant closure during wedding is specific and believable.
    (4) Regular customer - SATISFIED: Mrs. Chen appears multiple times, represents
    neighborhood continuity and David''s purpose. (5) Hopeful but realistic ending
    - SATISFIED: David moves to California to teach cooking, not to be ''rescued''
    but to begin again; recipes continue but restaurant is lost. (6) Korean cultural
    element beyond food - PARTIALLY SATISFIED: Incense ritual before wife''s photo
    is present but underdeveloped. Could be stronger; feels somewhat secondary to
    food symbolism.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Act I setup (Days 1-2) clearly established with demolition notice,
    Sophie''s call, Mrs. Chen visit, and arrival. Act II confrontation (Day 3) features
    explicit father-daughter conflict about the restaurant and wedding absence. Act
    III resolution shows cooking together, discovery of wife''s journal, decision
    to move forward. All three beats present and functional.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong emotional arc with genuine tension. Pacing effective—moves
    from crisis through conflict to reconciliation without feeling rushed. Dialogue
    feels natural. Sensory details (knife through cabbage, burned bulgogi, incense
    smoke) ground the story. The ending balances loss with possibility effectively.
    Minor weakness: the resolution moves somewhat quickly from confrontation to reconciliation;
    could benefit from more scenes showing the shift in their relationship. The wife''s
    journal discovery feels slightly convenient as a turning point, though emotionally
    resonant.


    ADHERENCE: Output follows plan closely but compresses some Act II material and
    streamlines the final resolution. The plan''s detailed breakdown of Days 3-7 is
    condensed into fewer scenes in the actual narrative, which works for pacing but
    loses some of the planned tension escalation.'
