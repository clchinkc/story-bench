  evidence: 'V0 was a short fragment with basic sensory detail and an absent conclusion.
    V1 made a small extension but remained minimal. V2 added more concrete props (sack
    of oranges, twelve-pack detail) and slightly increased texture. The final version
    substantially expanded the scene: full domestic tableau, a specific, crystallizing
    exchange with Abuela (her Nogales story and explicit permission to try), clear
    displays of Mateo''s inner conflict (thumb hovering, hiding the letter, physical
    tension), and authentic cultural details preserved and deepened (comal, masa,
    Jarritos, rebozo, agua de jamaica, Vicks, Spanish dialogue). The revisions responded
    to feedback by developing the grandmother moment and showing internal conflict,
    but the narrative stops mid-utterance without a final, earned resolution, leaving
    the last constraint unmet.'
