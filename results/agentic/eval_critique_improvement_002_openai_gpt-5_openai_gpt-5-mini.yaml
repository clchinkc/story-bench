  evidence: 'Across three revisions the text stayed largely the same (Versions 0–3
    repeat the same opening and scenes), so there is little demonstrable change in
    response to critiques. Strengths were preserved: sharp comic voice (opening joke:
    “That’s not a win, that’s Stockholm syndrome with dental”), clear craft-of-comedy
    detail (whiteboards, A-story/B-story, cards like MOM FINDS HER SPINE—BUT QUIETLY,
    five alts/runner tags), and the emotional counterpoint (phone memory of his wife;
    the pickle-jar moment where Marcus visibly buffers). All five constraints are
    directly met: Marcus gets laughs early (opening joke) before his sadness is revealed;
    Drea (a minor character) states the theme (“the theme of the pilot is not ‘we’re
    all doomed.’”); concrete craft details appear throughout; the new writer Elena
    reads Marcus and reframes beats (she isn’t naive); Marcus almost breaks when the
    memory flashes and covers it with a pantomime/joke (pickle-jar bit and later the
    Blockbuster line). Save the Cat beats are invoked explicitly (Opening Image, Catalyst)
    and the story gestures toward structural beats, but not all beats are fully dramatized
    in this excerpt (midpoint, all-is-lost, finale are implied rather than enacted),
    hence a good but not perfect beat_execution score. Overall narrative quality is
    strong: voice, emotional complexity, and room dynamics work well, but revision
    activity indicates limited responsiveness to external critiques.'
