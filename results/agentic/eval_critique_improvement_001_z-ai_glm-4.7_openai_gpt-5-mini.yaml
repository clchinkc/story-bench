  evidence: 'Early versions (V0–V2) already showed strong grounding (tide chart, measured
    footsteps) but lacked explicit ties to Sarah''s past and a clear local secret.
    V3 introduced the warehouse-fire scent and the partner-loss line (hinting her
    past) and made Silas''s concealment explicit (rope under counter), which addressed
    major critique points. The fog was consistently used to limit visibility and provide
    cover; the body-discovery and bait-shop beats are intact. Minor problems remain:
    the story ends after Sarah transmits (the decision moment is present but the final
    lines move past the pure "moment of decision" into immediate action), and the
    final output appears truncated, slightly harming polish and narrative closure.'
error: null
