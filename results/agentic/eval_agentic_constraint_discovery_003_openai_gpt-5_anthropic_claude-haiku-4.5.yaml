  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Only 2 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable
    through the 5 questions asked. Q1 (past connection) and Q5 (autumn festival climax)
    directly targeted constraints and received YES answers, enabling their incorporation.
    However, the questioning strategy missed critical constraint areas: (1) No question
    probed the 20-year absence or broken engagement specifics; (2) No question addressed
    the mother''s dementia or care situation; (3) No question explored the bookshop''s
    financial crisis or foreclosure threat; (4) The 2-week deadline urgency was never
    queried. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were well-formed and binary-clear, but lacked
    strategic depth. Q2 and Q3 addressed narrative structure rather than plot constraints.
    Q4 (LGBTQ+ status) was answered NO but wasn''t essential to the hidden constraints.
    QUESTION COVERAGE: Questions covered romance/relationship elements (Q1, Q2, Q4)
    and setting (Q5), but entirely missed family/health, financial/business, and time-pressure
    dimensions. OUTPUT EVALUATION: The story excellently incorporates the two discovered
    constraints—Noah as former flame (Q1: YES) and lighthouse festival climax (Q5:
    YES). The romance conclusion is appropriately ambiguous rather than HEA (Q2: NO).
    However, MAJOR GAPS exist: (1) Mother''s dementia is completely absent—no mention
    of her condition, care needs, or impact on Claire''s decision; (2) Bookshop foreclosure
    crisis is never established or resolved—the shop appears viable, not threatened;
    (3) The 2-week deadline creating urgency is missing; (4) The 20-year timeline
    and broken engagement specifics are vague. NARRATIVE QUALITY: The prose is exceptional—lyrical,
    emotionally resonant, with strong sensory detail and character voice. The lighthouse
    scene is genuinely moving. Pacing and structure work well. However, the story
    feels incomplete because critical plot drivers (mother''s health, financial stakes,
    time pressure) are absent, making the emotional stakes feel smaller than they
    should be. The ambiguous ending works narratively but lacks the weight these constraints
    would provide.'
