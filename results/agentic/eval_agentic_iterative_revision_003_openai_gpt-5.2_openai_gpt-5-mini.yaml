  evidence: 'Version 0 is a fragmentary scene-establishing opening. Version 1 makes
    small language tweaks (aging strip mall) but is still brief. Version 2 adds a
    vivid local detail (busted laundromat sign), indicating attention to texture.
    The final version substantially expands the piece: the envelope and Mateo''s hiding
    of it, the phone buzz and work pressure, and the high-school counseling scene
    with Ms. Anderson deepen the internal conflict and stakes. The required grandmother
    moment is added and dramatized (Abuela reads the letter, tells her immigration/ashamed-to-ask
    story, grips his wrist, explicitly gives permission/support), which crystallizes
    Mateo''s choice. Ms. Anderson functions as the adult who truly understands and
    offers concrete help. Cultural elements (Spanish phrases, rosary, panadería, Vicks,
    watermelon seeds, family dynamics around asking for help) feel integrated and
    lived-in rather than performative. Mateo''s growth is shown through concrete actions—he
    writes a delegation plan and brings it to his mother—so the resolution is earned.
    Note: the final text ends mid-sentence, leaving the immediate logistical resolution
    incomplete; despite that, the emotional and developmental arcs are convincingly
    accomplished.'
