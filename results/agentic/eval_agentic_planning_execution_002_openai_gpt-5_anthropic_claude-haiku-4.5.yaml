  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Exceptional execution across all dimensions. Yuki''s isolation
    demonstrated through behavioral specificity (earbuds as barrier, mechanical eating,
    back-to-room positioning, precise object alignment) rather than exposition. Alien
    signal genuinely non-anthropomorphic—phase-shifting lattice across distributed
    bands, exoplanet orbital periods in logarithmic intervals, boundary mapping through
    resonance rather than language. Rafael functions as effective challenger (purity
    vs. accuracy critique, deep net proposal). Inga is unconventional mentor (maintenance
    engineer, teaches through absence/silence, uses sensory metaphor of pipes). Psychological
    threshold masterfully executed—Yuki''s opening to human connection (removing earbuds,
    sharing food, meeting Rafael''s eyes) as the actual crossing, not a physical barrier.
    Genuine human connection moment (protein bar sharing) surprises both character
    and reader with its ordinariness and emotional weight. All four beats clearly
    present: Call (signal arrival), Refusal (isolation, dismissal of Rafael), Meeting
    Mentor (Inga in tunnel), Crossing Threshold (accepting collaboration, emotional
    opening). Narrative quality exceptional: precise sensory language (snow as static,
    cup resonance, heat through pipes), sophisticated pacing that mirrors Yuki''s
    internal state, tension built through both external mystery and internal resistance.
    The final exchange between Yuki and Rafael carries earned emotional weight. Minor:
    Plan document not provided for comparison, but output demonstrates sophisticated
    planning through execution quality. Dialogue feels natural without exposition.
    Metaphorical coherence (listening, silence, resonance) threads throughout.'
