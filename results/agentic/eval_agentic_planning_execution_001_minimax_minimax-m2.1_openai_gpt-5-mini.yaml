  evidence: 'All six constraints appear in the final story: a false lead (Thomas Wright),
    an unconventional profiling approach (mapping city geography / ''sanctuaries''
    and focusing on ''firsts'' and mirroring), a ticking-clock (48:00:00 countdown
    and explicit 72-hour/2-hour deadlines), a secondary-character betrayal (Detective
    Ray O''Donnell leaking info / FBI distancing Marcus), a Midpoint that is a direct
    (verbal) confrontation with the Rainmaker in the flooded basement, and explicit
    confrontation of Marcus''s past failure regarding Elena. Required beats are present
    and clearly executed: Catalyst (first body), Debate (Marcus weighing whether to
    act / being taken off the case / therapy), Break into Two (breaking into FBI evidence
    room / given two hours), Midpoint (the non-physical confrontation in the basement).
    The provided plan included key thematic and profiling ideas but was somewhat truncated
    — it set up specifics well but didn''t enumerate every later plot beat; the final
    draft adheres closely to and fulfills the plan, with good pacing, tension, and
    emotional stakes.'
