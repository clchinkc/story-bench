  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.4): Critiques 2 and 3 explicitly flagged missing
    story text. The final output addresses this by providing substantial narrative,
    but the revision trajectory shows VERSION 1 and VERSION 2 are still marked as
    ellipses—suggesting incomplete revision documentation. The writer did not demonstrate
    iterative response to specific feedback points about emotional complexity (0.72
    from Critique 1).


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.3): Without visible VERSION 1 and VERSION 2 content,
    improvement cannot be traced. The jump from VERSION 0 fragment to final output
    shows expansion but not demonstrable refinement. The opening remains identical
    across versions, suggesting limited revision depth.


    PRESERVATION (0.6): The clown shoes premise—strong comedic specificity—is preserved.
    The writers'' room atmosphere and Marcus''s internal hollowness are maintained.
    However, the incomplete revision history makes full assessment difficult.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.6 / 3 of 5):

    1. ✓ LAUGH BEFORE SAD: The clown shoes joke lands genuinely (Brad snorts, room
    erupts) before Marcus''s emptiness is revealed. SATISFIED.

    2. ✓ THEME BY MINOR CHARACTER: Kevin states the theme (''if you have to dissect
    the frog to find the funny, you''ve already killed it''). SATISFIED.

    3. ✓ COMEDY CRAFT WITH DETAIL: The clown shoes bit shows specific comedic reasoning
    (implication of rushing/squeaking). SATISFIED.

    4. ✗ NEW WRITER SEES THROUGH MARCUS: Lena is introduced but the excerpt cuts off
    mid-sentence. Her perception of Marcus is not demonstrated. UNSATISFIED.

    5. ✗ MARCUS ALMOST BREAKS/COVERS WITH JOKE: Marcus feels hollow and watches the
    laughter from distance, but there''s no moment where he nearly breaks emotionally
    then deflects with humor. The marker-writing is mechanical, not a cover. UNSATISFIED.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.5): Save the Cat structure is partially visible—Setup (writers''
    room), Inciting Incident (Lena''s arrival begins), Theme (Kevin''s statement).
    However, the excerpt cuts before B Story, Fun and Games, or Midpoint. Incomplete
    execution due to truncation.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.7): Strong opening with vivid sensory detail (''stale Pad
    Thai and despair''). Marcus''s internal state is rendered with genuine pathos.
    The clown shoes premise demonstrates sophisticated comedic thinking. Kevin''s
    dialogue feels authentic to a writers'' room hierarchy. However, the abrupt cut-off
    and missing Lena characterization prevent full assessment. The prose quality is
    high where present.


    KEY ISSUES: (1) Revision documentation incomplete—VERSION 1 and 2 missing prevents
    tracing improvement; (2) Story truncated mid-scene, leaving 2 of 5 constraints
    unverifiable; (3) No evidence of Lena''s ''seeing through'' Marcus or his near-break
    moment; (4) Critique responsiveness unclear due to incomplete revision history.'
