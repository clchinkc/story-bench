  evidence: 'Initial draft (V0) established setting but used uneven voice and leaned
    toward adult phrasing. V1 intentionally shifted to more colloquial, kid-like language
    (e.g., ''kinda'', ''like'', ''Um...''), addressing the primary youth-voice critiques;
    V2 and V3 largely preserved V1 wording. The final version expanded plot beats
    (data slate discovery, community dismissal, mentor reveal, dangerous crossing)
    and explicitly included Zara''s invention and a specific mentor flaw. Improvements
    are clear but modest: youth voice improved from noticeably adult to mostly convincing
    12-year-old phrasing (critique scores clustered 0.70–0.80), yet some lines retain
    an adult narrator''s cadence. Strengths (worldbuilding, stakes, the wave-glider
    invention, and the mentor''s flaw) were preserved and clarified, but revision
    rounds plateaued after V1 rather than iterating further to fully eliminate residual
    adultisms or deepen later beats.'
