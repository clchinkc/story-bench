  evidence: The critiques consistently pointed to a need for deeper character interiority,
    particularly regarding Teddy's emotional state and his relationship with Lorraine's
    absence. The revisions show a clear effort to integrate this feedback. Version
    0 had some interiority ('The past was a detour'), but it was more stated than
    felt. Critique 1 highlighted this, and subsequent versions (especially the final
    output) introduced more visceral reactions ('His jaw ached from clenching the
    uneaten peppermint,' 'The peppermint bit his tongue—sharp, familiar, wrong,' 'The
    thought of new growth gripped his chest like a cramp'). The final version successfully
    weaves Teddy's internal struggle and his wife's presence-through-absence into
    the narrative, making his journey of adaptation more compelling. The initial strengths,
    such as the specific details of Teddy's routine and the evocative prose, were
    maintained and enhanced.
