  evidence: The initial critiques focused on character interiority, which was significantly
    enhanced in the final version through details like 'six dents on Elm Street, one
    for each decade' and the internal monologue 'four in, hold, six out' tied to Martha's
    memory. The 'Key Changes' section explicitly addresses how the revisions aimed
    for subtlety and a more resonant ending, which is evident in the final prose.
    The story successfully integrates all constraints, particularly the specific details
    of Teddy's routine, the disruption revealing his avoidance of connection, Elena
    as the intersecting neighbor, Martha's presence through absence (locket, Sanka,
    memories), and the new path offering connection and a softened perspective on
    his routine. The narrative quality is strong, with evocative language and a clear
    emotional arc. The beats are well-executed, showing Teddy's journey from routine
    to disruption, finding allies, adapting, and ultimately choosing a new path that
    integrates his past with a more open future.
