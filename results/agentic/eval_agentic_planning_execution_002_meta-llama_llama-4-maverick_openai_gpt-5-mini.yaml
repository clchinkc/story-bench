  evidence: 'Plan: Detailed and targeted—names, locations, character roles, and required
    beats are specified. Final output adherence: All four required beats are present
    (Call to Adventure: encrypted message; Refusal: hesitation and attempted avoidance;
    Meeting the Mentor: Dr. Maya Singh; Crossing the Threshold: Yuki confronting isolation
    while working with the team). Constraints: satisfied — colleague who challenges
    Yuki (Dr. Elianore Quasar); unconventional mentor (Dr. Maya Singh, scientist/poet);
    psychological Threshold (Yuki confronts fear of connection); surprising human
    connection (Dr. Singh''s story and Yuki reciprocating). Not satisfied — Yuki''s
    isolation is partly shown via behaviors (eating alone, focused on code) but undermined
    by explicit exposition (“Yuki''s isolation was a comfort, a shield”), violating
    the requirement to show it without exposition; the alien signal becomes anthropomorphized
    (it ends up delivering a ''warning'' and ''message of hope''), so it does not
    feel genuinely alien. Narrative quality: solid pacing and character dynamics,
    but weakened by telling rather than showing and by making the alien signal too
    humanlike.'
