    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

  content: 'Barley tea hissed into the dented kettle, filling the silent restaurant
    with the scent of roasted grain. David Park unlocked the front door while dawn
    shivered above Chicago, then wiped the fog from his wife’s photograph: her laugh
    forever paused above the register. Two cups waited on the counter, as if she might
    still walk in; his own tea cooled untouched.


    The metal thump of the mail slot broke the calm. A yellow envelope slid across
    the floor—FINAL NOTICE, stamped in red. Highway 94 Expansion, Demolition in Seven
    Days. Compensation figure, insultingly small. David folded the letter like a napkin
    and tucked it beneath the cash tray.


    “Morning, Chef!” Mr. Alvarez called when noon rolled around. The retired mailman
    had arrived every Tuesday since Clinton was president. While David served him
    steaming kimchi fried rice, Alvarez winked. “Guess the new highway’ll get me here
    even faster, huh?” He chuckled, but his eyes searched David’s for reassurance
    that some places, at least, wouldn’t vanish.


    The reassurance never came.


    That night, at the neighborhood meeting, activists waved petitions. David sat
    in the back, hands smelling of sesame oil, saying nothing. Outside, winter wind
    rattled the restaurant’s faded sign like a begging bowl.


    Two days later, the bell over the door jingled and Grace appeared, suitcase first.
    Her hair smelled of airport recirculation and unfamiliar shampoo. “I’ve got a
    week off,” she said. “Enough time to pack what matters.” She didn’t hug him; instead
    she inhaled deeply. “Kimchi jjigae? You still add too much gochugaru.”


    “You always said not enough,” David replied, ladling red broth that hissed against
    the metal bowl. The air between them thickened hotter than the stew.


    Orders kept coming—weddings clinging to tradition, a church bazaar unwilling to
    refund deposits. Father and daughter cooked shoulder to shoulder. Grace lined
    measuring cups like soldiers; David pinched salt by instinct. When they argued
    over jangajji pickles, Grace cited ratios; David answered with memory. She spat
    out the word han, that ache woven into every Korean’s spine, accusing him of feeding
    it instead of healing it. He countered with jeong, the stubborn bond that refuses
    to break. The stainless-steel counters reflected their scowls.


    On the fourth night, Mr. Alvarez slumped over his ddukbokki. Ambulance lights
    splashed the windows crimson. Riding beside him, David gripped the old man’s chilled
    hand.


    “Chef,” Alvarez whispered through an oxygen mask, “this place—proposed to Rosa
    right there, 1999. Don’t let them bury my memories with me.”


    The mask fogged; David suddenly saw his wife’s photo again, behind glass, waiting
    for him to answer.


    Next morning he filled out injunction forms, wrists aching. The lawyer’s shrug
    said everything. Grace erupted. “You’ll fight city hall but you wouldn’t walk
    ten steps from the kitchen to Mom’s casket. I had to speak alone!” Her voice cracked;
    soy sauce shimmered on the verge of boiling over. “I turned down culinary school
    because I didn’t want to beg for loans like you did. So I code. Stable, boring,
    safe. And you still choose these bricks over me.”


    Outside, orange spray paint X’d the restaurant’s façade. In the crush of evening
    tickets, David left galbi on the grill too long. Smoke rolled through the vents,
    thick as temple incense. He didn’t curse, only stared until the meat blackened,
    tears stinging from heat and something older.


    At dawn he dragged every table onto the sidewalk. Snow flurries danced among bowls
    of haejangguk, the hangover soup rich with ox bone and redemption. Club kids,
    nurses, cabbies, even the alderman queued. Someone livestreamed; hashtags bloomed.
    Grace ladled broth, hair whipping in the wind, cheeks flushed.


    When the sun dipped, the crowd surged again—neighbors, reporters, alderman’s aides.
    Grace climbed a milk crate. “My mother taught us that food holds memory,” she
    began, voice trembling but clear. “If this restaurant falls, the neighborhood
    forgets a chapter of itself.” She recited the words she once wrote for a funeral
    eulogy nobody heard, adding new lines for every patron who’d celebrated, mourned,
    or fallen in love within those walls. David stepped beside her, hand steady on
    her shoulder.


    The alderman’s office announced a sixty-day stay for historical review. Not victory,
    but oxygen. The crowd cheered; Grace exhaled like a pressure valve finally loosened.


    On the seventh night, steel shutters rattled down for what might be the last time.
    In the tiny courtyard behind the alley, father and daughter knelt. David lowered
    a clay jar of jangajji into the thawing earth.


    “Bury it now,” he said, patting soil over the lid, “taste it later. Good things
    change underground.”


    Grace pressed the last clod into place. “Wherever ‘later’ is,” she answered, not
    as question but agreement.


    Luggage rattled into the back seat of her rental. As they merged onto Lake Shore
    Drive, skyline lights rippled across the windshield. David glanced once in the
    mirror: the restaurant sign shrinking, still lit, letters flickering but alive.


    He reached for the thermos wedged between them. Barley tea, still warm. He passed
    it to his daughter. She drank, then set it in the cup holder—two cups, one journey,
    steam curling upward into the dark like a promise given time to steep.'
