    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.

    Theodore Washington rose at 5:47, thirteen minutes before his alarm. He always
    rose before the alarm. This small victory, repeated each morning, settled into
    his bones like the first sip of coffee.


    The kitchen still held Eleanor''s coffee cup—a blue speckled mug she''d claimed
    for thirty years. He''d never moved it. Some mornings he poured hot water over
    the instant crystals and let the steam rise between them, speaking quietly to
    the mug the way he might have spoken to her if she''d stayed. If he''d known which
    words would matter.


    His route began at 6:30. Not 6:00, not 6:15—6:30. The Morrison''s newspaper landed
    at their driveway first, then the Kowalski''s porch, then the Hendersons'', where
    Mrs. Henderson left him cookies at Christmas and told him he looked thinner each
    year. He wasn''t thinner. He was exactly the same weight he''d been since 1987.


    The cracks in the sidewalk knew him. One particular buckle on Cypress Street forced
    him to step left; he''d adjusted so automatically that his body anticipated it
    before his mind did. The Elm Street house with the red door had a new color—sage
    now—and he''d felt the disorientation like a stone in his shoe. But he''d kept
    walking. Colors changed. People didn''t.


    Margaret Chen moved into the gray bungalow on Maple last spring. She kept odd
    hours, left for work before he passed, returned after his evening television.
    He''d seen her silhouette through windows a hundred times but never spoken to
    her. Some neighborhoods Simply evolved around silence.


    Then came the orange barrels.


    Clyde Avenue, his usual left turn, exhaled gravel and equipment. A man in a hard
    hat handed him a flyer: *Utility improvements. Estimated completion: six months.*


    Six months.


    Teddy stood there with the paper in his hand, feeling the familiar grid of his
    route pull away from him like a tablecloth slipped free from under dishes. He
    could turn around. Go home. But the route wasn''t just exercise—it was the architecture
    of his days, the skeleton upon which his hours hung.


    He turned right instead.


    The unfamiliar street smelled different. Brick instead of siding. A yard with
    actual garden beds, not just grass. He walked slower, letting his feet find new
    cracks, new buckles. His body didn''t know this path. His body was a stranger
    here.


    That''s when he noticed the garden.


    Margaret Chen knelt among tomato cages, dirt smudged on her knees. She looked
    up as he passed—surprised, maybe, to see a stranger on her morning.


    "You''re the newspaper man," she said. "From Cypress."


    "Retired," he said. Then: "Was."


    She smiled. "I''m Margaret. I wave at you sometimes. You don''t see me."


    He started to apologize, but she was already standing, brushing dirt from her
    jeans. "My mother died last year. Same month I moved in. She kept telling me to
    plant tomatoes." She gestured at the uneven rows. "I never knew if she meant here
    or somewhere else. So I planted them anyway."


    Teddy looked at her garden—stubborn, chaotic, alive. He thought of Eleanor''s
    coffee cup. The mug he''d never emptied, never washed, simply refilled each morning
    until the instant crystals left a ring at the surface like a tide mark.


    "I''ve walked the same route for forty years," he said. "I knew every house. Every
    schedule. I thought that meant something."


    "It means you paid attention," Margaret said.


    "Doesn''t mean I saw anything."


    She laughed—not unkindly. "Want a tomato? They don''t look like much, but they''re
    sweet."


    He took one. The flesh gave slightly beneath his thumb, warm from the morning
    sun. He bit into it and tasted summer, sharp and unexpected, running down his
    chin.


    Margaret smiled. "See you tomorrow?"


    The question hung there, a new crack in an old sidewalk.


    Teddy wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "Same time," he said.


    That evening, he emptied Eleanor''s coffee cup for the first time. He washed it
    carefully, set it on the rack, and did not feel she was gone. He felt, instead,
    that she had finally stopped waiting for him to move.'

  content: "# CRITIQUE: The Long Way Home\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Character Interiority\n\
    **SCORE: 0.75**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Strong moments: \"His body was a stranger\
    \ here\" and \"He felt the disorientation like a stone in his shoe\"\n- Internal\
    \ conflict shown through ritual: rising 13 minutes before the alarm, speaking\
    \ to Eleanor's mug\n- The coffee cup as a window into grief and avoidance\n\n\
    **FEEDBACK:** While Teddy's rituals reveal *what* he does, the story could probe\
    \ *why* more deeply. What specifically does the routine protect him from? The\
    \ closest we get is \"If he'd known which words would matter\"—but his deeper\
    \ fear about change, loss of control, or unworthiness of connection remains largely\
    \ subtext. Consider a moment where Teddy consciously *resists* stepping off his\
    \ route, where we feel his internal debate. Currently, he turns right fairly quickly.\
    \ A paragraph showing him standing at the intersection, weighing his fear against\
    \ some inchoate longing, would deepen interiority significantly.\n\n---\n\n##\
    \ CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\n**SCORE: 0.95**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n1. ✓ Routine\
    \ with loving detail: \"one particular buckle on Cypress Street,\" \"6:30. Not\
    \ 6:00, not 6:15,\" Eleanor's mug refilled daily\n2. ✓ Disruption reveals avoidance:\
    \ Orange barrels force a choice; the resolution shows he's been avoiding change/grief/connection\n\
    3. ✓ Neighbor intersection: Margaret Chen, with her own grief mirror (mother's\
    \ death)\n4. ✓ Late wife present through absence: Eleanor's untouched mug is the\
    \ emotional fulcrum\n5. ✓ New path offers something old couldn't: Human connection,\
    \ specific warmth of a tomato, direct conversation\n\n**FEEDBACK:** All constraints\
    \ met excellently. Minor note: Margaret's story (mother's death, planting tomatoes)\
    \ parallels Teddy's so cleanly it borders on too-neat. Consider slightly complicating\
    \ her narrative—perhaps she's angry at her mother, or the tomatoes are failing—to\
    \ prevent the resolution from feeling overly symmetrical.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION:\
    \ Beat Execution\n**SCORE: 0.75**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- **You:** First 4 paragraphs\
    \ establish comfort zone with precision\n- **Need:** \"The orange barrels\" section\
    \ identifies the inciting incident\n- **Go:** \"He turned right instead\" + new\
    \ street description\n- **Search:** Margaret encounter and garden\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\
    \ The **Need** beat is underpowered. When Teddy receives the flyer, we get one\
    \ line of external reaction (\"pulled away from him like a tablecloth\") but minimal\
    \ internal debate. Does he consider turning around? Going home? A moment of paralysis\
    \ would strengthen this beat. \n\nMore critically, the **Search** beat (adaptation)\
    \ is too brief. Teddy encounters Margaret, bites the tomato, agrees to return—all\
    \ in ~300 words. Expand this: What does his body feel as he walks the new route?\
    \ Does he get lost? Does he second-guess the turn multiple times? Show us the\
    \ discomfort of adaptation, not just its quick resolution.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION:\
    \ Subtlety\n**SCORE: 0.85**\n\n**EVIDENCE - Strong:**\n- The emptying of the coffee\
    \ cup as physical manifestation of emotional release (not stated directly)\n-\
    \ \"warm from the morning sun\" — sensory detail replacing explanation\n- \"tide\
    \ mark\" — metaphor for invisible accumulation of grief\n\n**EVIDENCE - Weaker:**\n\
    - \"He felt, instead, that she had finally stopped waiting for him to move\" —\
    \ This explicitly *tells* his emotional revelation rather than letting us infer\
    \ it from the action of emptying the cup\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The final paragraph\
    \ risks over-explaining. We've already seen him wash and empty the cup—that's\
    \ a powerful image. The sentence \"He felt, instead, that she had finally stopped\
    \ waiting\" pushes the meaning too far into exposition. Trust the reader. Consider\
    \ ending at \"did not feel she was gone\" or revise the final thought into something\
    \ more subtle, like a physical sensation or action rather than an emotional epiphany.\n\
    \n---\n\n## CRITERION: Narrative Quality\n**SCORE: 0.88**\n\n**EVIDENCE - Excellent:**\n\
    - \"the skeleton upon which his hours hung\" — elegant, specific metaphor\n- \"\
    like a tablecloth slipped free from under dishes\" — vivid and tactile\n- Rhythmic\
    \ control in sentences like: \"Not 6:00, not 6:15—6:30\"\n- The final image of\
    \ tomato juice running down his chin is visceral and earned\n\n**EVIDENCE - Minor\
    \ Issues:**\n- \"Some neighborhoods Simply evolved around silence\" — The capital\
    \ S on \"Simply\" appears to be a typo\n- Slight tell in \"None of this meant\
    \ what he thought it meant\" implied but not stated—this restraint is good, but\
    \ earlier passages occasionally nudge toward over-explanation\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\
    \ Overall prose is strong. Polish the typo. Consider tightening the final three\
    \ sentences slightly; they're nearly perfect but \"finally\" in the last sentence\
    \ is doing redundant narrative work alongside \"stopped waiting.\"\n\n---\n\n\
    ## OVERALL_ASSESSMENT\n\n**This is a accomplished story that successfully meets\
    \ all constraints and executes the Story Circle beats with genuine emotional resonance.**\
    \ Teddy's character feels lived-in, the prose is controlled and lyrical, and the\
    \ ending—particularly the image of the warm tomato—conveys transformation through\
    \ action. The primary areas for development are: (1) deepening Teddy's internal\
    \ resistance to change with a more dramatic **Need** beat, (2) expanding the **Search**\
    \ section to show discomfort and adaptation more fully, and (3) trusting subtlety\
    \ completely by removing the explicit emotional epiphany in the final lines. With\
    \ these revisions, this moves from very good to exceptional."

    Theodore Washington rose at 5:47, thirteen minutes before his alarm. He always
    rose before the alarm. This small victory, repeated each morning, settled into
    his bones like the first sip of coffee.


    The kitchen still held Eleanor''s coffee cup—a blue speckled mug she''d claimed
    for thirty years. He''d never moved it. Some mornings he poured hot water over
    the instant crystals and let the steam rise between them, speaking quietly to
    the mug the way he might have spoken to her if she''d stayed. If he''d known which
    words would matter.


    His route began at 6:30. Not 6:00, not 6:15—6:30. The Morrisons'' newspaper landed
    at their driveway first, then the Kowalskis'' porch, then the Hendersons'', where
    Mrs. Henderson left him cookies at Christmas and told him he looked thinner each
    year. He wasn''t thinner. He was exactly the same weight he''d been since 1987.


    The cracks in the sidewalk knew him. One particular buckle on Cypress Street forced
    him to step left; he''d adjusted so automatically that his body anticipated it
    before his mind did. The Elm Street house with the red door had a new color—sage
    now—and he''d felt the disorientation like a stone in his shoe. But he''d kept
    walking. Colors changed. People didn''t.


    Margaret Chen moved into the gray bungalow on Maple last spring. She kept odd
    hours, left for work before he passed, returned after his evening television.
    He''d seen her silhouette through windows a hundred times but never spoken to
    her. Some neighborhoods simply evolved around silence.


    Then came the orange barrels.

    Six months.


    Teddy stood there with the paper in his hand, feeling the familiar grid of his
    route pull away from him like a tablecloth slipped free from under dishes. He
    could turn around. Go home. The thought rose in his chest with a kind of desperate
    relief—yes, go home, retreat into the kitchen and the mug and the hours arranged
    around his routine like books on a shelf. The route wasn''t just exercise. It
    was the architecture of his days, the skeleton upon which his hours hung. Without
    it, what held morning to noon?


    But his feet didn''t move toward home. They stayed rooted at the intersection,
    and he felt the weight of forty years pressing down—not heavy, exactly, but present.
    A force of habit so complete it had become invisible. He''d walked this route
    through snow and heat, through the years after Eleanor when walking had been the
    only thing that kept him from becoming furniture. If he turned back now, he was
    choosing the weight over the walk.


    He turned right instead.


    The unfamiliar street smelled different. Brick instead of siding. A yard with
    actual garden beds, not just grass. He walked slower, letting his feet find new
    cracks, new buckles. His body didn''t know this path. His body was a stranger
    here. He passed a house with blue shutters, a house with a bicycle lying in the
    yard, a house where a dog barked at him through a chain-link fence—three sounds
    he didn''t recognize, three foreign notes in a song he''d thought he knew by heart.


    He walked three blocks before he realized he''d gone too far. The street signs
    were wrong. The sun sat at an angle he didn''t expect. He stood at an intersection
    he didn''t recognize, and for a moment the world tilted—not dangerous, exactly,
    but uncertain. He could have turned around. He almost did.


    That''s when he noticed the garden.


    Margaret Chen knelt among tomato cages, dirt smudged on her knees. She looked
    up as he passed—surprised, maybe, to see a stranger on her morning.


    "You''re the newspaper man," she said. "From Cypress."


    "Retired," he said. Then: "Was."


    She smiled. "I''m Margaret. I wave at you sometimes. You don''t see me."


    He started to apologize, but she was already standing, brushing dirt from her
    jeans. "My mother died last year. Same month I moved in. She kept telling me to
    plant tomatoes." She gestured at the uneven rows. "I never knew if she meant here
    or somewhere else. So I planted them anyway."


    Teddy looked at her garden—stubborn, chaotic, alive. He thought of Eleanor''s
    coffee cup. The mug he''d never emptied, never washed, simply refilled each morning
    until the instant crystals left a ring at the surface like a tide mark.


    "I''ve walked the same route for forty years," he said. "I knew every house. Every
    schedule. I thought that meant something."


    "It means you paid attention," Margaret said.


    "Doesn''t mean I saw anything."


    She laughed—not unkindly. "Want a tomato? They don''t look like much, but they''re
    sweet."


    He took one. The flesh gave slightly beneath his thumb, warm from the morning
    sun. He bit into it and tasted summer, sharp and unexpected, running down his
    chin.


    Margaret smiled. "See you tomorrow?"


    The question hung there, a new crack in an old sidewalk.


    Teddy wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "Same time," he said.


    That evening, he emptied Eleanor''s coffee cup for the first time. He washed it
    carefully, set it on the rack, and did not feel she was gone. He felt, instead,
    the quiet space where waiting used to live—now empty, finally, and his to walk
    through.'

  content: '# The Long Way Home


    Theodore Washington rose at 5:47, thirteen minutes before his alarm. He always
    rose before the alarm. This small victory, repeated each morning, settled into
    his bones like the first sip of coffee.


    The kitchen still held Eleanor''s coffee cup—a blue speckled mug she''d claimed
    for thirty years. He''d never moved it. Some mornings he poured hot water over
    the instant crystals and let the steam rise between them, speaking quietly to
    the mug the way he might have spoken to her if she''d stayed. If he''d known which
    words would matter.


    His route began at 6:30. Not 6:00, not 6:15—6:30. The Morrisons'' newspaper landed
    at their driveway first, then the Kowalskis'' porch, then the Hendersons'', where
    Mrs. Henderson left him cookies at Christmas and told him he looked thinner each
    year. He wasn''t thinner. He was exactly the same weight he''d been since 1987.


    The cracks in the sidewalk knew him. One particular buckle on Cypress Street forced
    him to step left; he''d adjusted so automatically that his body anticipated it
    before his mind did. The Elm Street house with the red door had a new color—sage
    now—and he''d felt the disorientation like a stone in his shoe. But he''d kept
    walking. Colors changed. People didn''t.


    Margaret Chen moved into the gray bungalow on Maple last spring. She kept odd
    hours, left for work before he passed, returned after his evening television.
    He''d seen her silhouette through windows a hundred times but never spoken to
    her. Some neighborhoods simply evolved around silence.


    Then came the orange barrels.


    Clyde Avenue, his usual left turn, exhaled gravel and equipment. A man in a hard
    hat handed him a flyer: *Utility improvements. Estimated completion: six months.*


    Six months.


    Teddy stood there with the paper in his hand, feeling the familiar grid of his
    route pull away from him like a tablecloth slipped free from under dishes. Turn
    around. Go home. The thought came easily, like a door swinging wide with a familiar
    creak. Home meant the kitchen and the mug and the hours arranged around his routine
    like books on a shelf. Without the route, what held morning to noon?


    His feet didn''t move toward home. They stayed rooted at the intersection, and
    he felt the weight of forty years pressing down—not heavy, exactly, but present.
    A force of habit so complete it had become invisible. His legs knew this pavement.
    His shoulders knew the angle of the sun at this hour. To turn back was to choose
    the known over the walk.


    But something else stirred in his chest. Not courage. Something smaller and more
    animal: a pull toward the unfamiliar street like a thread tugging at his shirt.
    He hadn''t felt it in years. Maybe never.


    He turned right instead.


    The unfamiliar street smelled different. Brick instead of siding. A yard with
    actual garden beds, not just grass. He walked slower, letting his feet find new
    cracks, new buckles. His body didn''t know this path. The ground seemed to shift
    beneath him, uncertain. He passed a house with blue shutters, a house with a bicycle
    lying in the yard, a house where a dog barked at him through a chain-link fence—three
    sounds he didn''t recognize, three foreign notes in a song he''d thought he knew
    by heart.


    He walked three blocks before he realized he''d gone too far. The street signs
    were wrong. The sun sat at an angle he didn''t expect. His chest felt tight. His
    breath came shorter. He stood at an intersection he didn''t recognize, and for
    a moment the world tilted—not dangerous, exactly, but uncertain. He could have
    turned around. He almost did.


    That''s when he noticed the garden.


    Margaret Chen knelt among tomato cages, dirt smudged on her knees. She looked
    up as he passed—surprised, maybe, to see a stranger on her morning.


    "You''re the newspaper man," she said. "From Cypress."


    "Retired," he said. Then: "Was."


    She smiled. "I''m Margaret. I wave at you sometimes. You don''t see me."


    He started to apologize, but she was already standing, brushing dirt from her
    jeans. "My mother died last year. Same month I moved in. She kept telling me to
    plant tomatoes." She gestured at the uneven rows. "I never knew if she meant here
    or somewhere else. So I planted them anyway."


    Teddy looked at her garden—stubborn, chaotic, alive. He thought of Eleanor''s
    coffee cup. The mug he''d never emptied, never washed, simply refilled each morning
    until the instant crystals left a ring at the surface like a tide mark.


    "I''ve walked the same route for forty years," he said. "I knew every house. Every
    schedule. I thought that meant something."


    "It means you paid attention," Margaret said.


    "Doesn''t mean I saw anything."


    She laughed—not unkindly. "Want a tomato? They don''t look like much, but they''re
    sweet."


    He took one. The flesh gave slightly beneath his thumb, warm from the morning
    sun. He bit into it and tasted summer, sharp and unexpected, running down his
    chin. For a moment he was back in Eleanor''s kitchen, summer 1989, tomatoes from
    the farmers'' market, her laughing at him for getting juice on his wrist.


    Margaret smiled. "See you tomorrow?"


    The question hung there, a new crack in an old sidewalk.


    Teddy wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "Same time," he said.


    That evening, he emptied Eleanor''s coffee cup for the first time. He washed it
    carefully, set it on the rack, and did not feel she was gone. He felt, instead,
    the quiet space where waiting used to live—now empty, finally, and his to walk
    through.'

    EVIDENCE: "This small victory, repeated each morning, settled into his bones like
    the first sip of coffee" and "Something smaller and more animal: a pull toward
    the unfamiliar street like a thread tugging at his shirt."

    FEEDBACK: Teddy''s inner life is present but remains somewhat philosophical and
    observational rather than deeply specific to his psychology. We see his routines
    and some emotional stirrings, but lack access to his particular anxieties about
    living after Eleanor''s death. Consider deeper exploration of specific fears:
    Does he fear forgetting her? Does he fear connection because it might diminish
    her memory? The moment when he''s lost on the unfamiliar street is a missed opportunity—"His
    chest felt tight" is physical but not distinctly Teddy''s emotional signature.
    What specific guilt or regret surfaces? The story would deepen if we entered his
    specific shame about having failed Eleanor ("If he''d known which words would
    matter") more fully.

    # The Long Way Home


    Theodore Washington rose at 5:47, thirteen minutes before his alarm. He always
    rose before the alarm. This small victory, repeated each morning, settled into
    his bones like the first sip of coffee.


    The kitchen still held Eleanor''s coffee cup—a blue speckled mug she''d claimed
    for thirty years. He''d never moved it. Some mornings he poured hot water over
    the instant crystals and let the steam rise between them, speaking quietly to
    the mug the way he might have spoken to her if she''d stayed. If he''d known which
    words would matter.


    His route began at 6:30. Not 6:00, not 6:15—6:30. The Morrisons'' newspaper landed
    at their driveway first, then the Kowalskis'' porch, then the Hendersons'', where
    Mrs. Henderson left him cookies at Christmas and told him he looked thinner each
    year. He wasn''t thinner. He was exactly the same weight he''d been since 1987.


    The cracks in the sidewalk knew him. One particular buckle on Cypress Street forced
    him to step left; he''d adjusted so automatically that his body anticipated it
    before his mind did. The Elm Street house with the red door had a new color—sage
    now—and he''d felt the disorientation like a stone in his shoe. But he''d kept
    walking. Colors changed. People didn''t.


    Margaret Chen moved into the gray bungalow on Maple last spring. She kept odd
    hours, left for work before he passed, returned after his evening television.
    He''d seen her silhouette through windows a hundred times but never spoken to
    her. Some neighborhoods simply evolved around silence.


    Then came the orange barrels.


    Clyde Avenue, his usual left turn, exhaled gravel and equipment. A man in a hard
    hat handed him a flyer: *Utility improvements. Estimated completion: six months.*


    Six months.


    Teddy stood there with the paper in his hand, feeling the familiar grid of his
    route pull away from him like a tablecloth slipped free from under dishes. Turn
    around. Go home. The thought came easily, like a door swinging wide with a familiar
    creak. Home meant the kitchen and the mug and the hours arranged around his routine
    like books on a shelf. Without the route, what held morning to noon?


    His feet didn''t move toward home. They stayed rooted at the intersection, and
    he felt the weight of forty years pressing down—not heavy, exactly, but present.
    A force of habit so complete it had become invisible. His legs knew this pavement.
    His shoulders knew the angle of the sun at this hour. To turn back was to choose
    the known over the walk.


    But something else stirred in his chest. Not courage. Something smaller and more
    animal: a pull toward the unfamiliar street like a thread tugging at his shirt.
    He hadn''t felt it in years. Maybe never.


    He turned right instead.


    The unfamiliar street smelled different. Brick instead of siding. A yard with
    actual garden beds, not just grass. He walked slower, letting his feet find new
    cracks, new buckles. His body didn''t know this path. The ground seemed to shift
    beneath him, uncertain. He passed a house with blue shutters, a house with a bicycle
    lying in the yard, a house where a dog barked at him through a chain-link fence—three
    sounds he didn''t recognize, three foreign notes in a song he''d thought he knew
    by heart.


    He walked three blocks before he realized he''d gone too far. The street signs
    were wrong. The sun sat at an angle he didn''t expect. His chest felt tight. His
    breath came shorter. He stood at an intersection he didn''t recognize, and for
    a moment the world tilted—not dangerous, exactly, but uncertain. He could have
    turned around. He almost did.


    That''s when he noticed the garden.


    Margaret Chen knelt among tomato cages, dirt smudged on her knees. She looked
    up as he passed—surprised, maybe, to see a stranger on her morning.


    "You''re the newspaper man," she said. "From Cypress."


    "Retired," he said. Then: "Was."


    She smiled. "I''m Margaret. I wave at you sometimes. You don''t see me."


    He started to apologize, but she was already standing, brushing dirt from her
    jeans. "My mother died last year. Same month I moved in. She kept telling me to
    plant tomatoes." She gestured at the uneven rows. "I never knew if she meant here
    or somewhere else. So I planted them anyway."


    Teddy looked at her garden—stubborn, chaotic, alive. He thought of Eleanor''s
    coffee cup. The mug he''d never emptied, never washed, simply refilled each morning
    until the instant crystals left a ring at the surface like a tide mark.


    "I''ve walked the same route for forty years," he said. "I knew every house. Every
    schedule. I thought that meant something."


    "It means you paid attention," Margaret said.


    "Doesn''t mean I saw anything."


    She laughed—not unkindly. "Want a tomato? They don''t look like much, but they''re
    sweet."


    He took one. The flesh gave slightly beneath his thumb, warm from the morning
    sun. He bit into it and tasted summer, sharp and unexpected, running down his
    chin. For a moment he was back in Eleanor''s kitchen, summer 1989, tomatoes from
    the farmers'' market, her laughing at him for getting juice on his wrist.


    Margaret smiled. "See you tomorrow?"


    The question hung there, a new crack in an old sidewalk.


    Teddy wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "Same time," he said.


    That evening, he emptied Eleanor''s coffee cup for the first time. He washed it
    carefully, set it on the rack, and did not feel she was gone. He felt, instead,
    the quiet space where waiting used to live—now empty, finally, and his to walk
    through.


    EDITOR''S CRITIQUE:

    CRITERION: character_interiority

    SCORE: 0.72

    EVIDENCE: "This small victory, repeated each morning, settled into his bones like
    the first sip of coffee" and "Something smaller and more animal: a pull toward
    the unfamiliar street like a thread tugging at his shirt."

    FEEDBACK: Teddy''s inner life is present but remains somewhat philosophical and
    observational rather than deeply specific to his psychology. We see his routines
    and some emotional stirrings, but lack access to his particular anxieties about
    living after Eleanor''s death. Consider deeper exploration of specific fears:
    Does he fear forgetting her? Does he fear connection because it might diminish
    her memory? The moment when he''s lost on the unfamiliar street is a missed opportunity—"His
    chest felt tight" is physical but not distinctly Teddy''s emotional signature.
    What specific guilt or regret surfaces? The story would deepen if we entered his
    specific shame about having failed Eleanor ("If he''d known which words would
    matter") more fully.

    glow of someone else also unable to sleep. He wondered if she knew he noticed.
    He wondered if noticing meant anything at all.


    This morning, standing at the kitchen counter, his coffee growing cold, Teddy
    felt the routine press against him like a door that wouldn''t open. He''d done
    this three hundred and sixty-five times a year for forty years. The number sat
    in his chest: fourteen thousand six hundred mornings. Fourteen thousand six hundred
    times rising, walking, returning. Fourteen thousand six hundred times not saying
    anything to anyone who needed to hear it.


    He poured the coffee down the sink. Then he refilled the mug with hot water and
    carried it to the table anyway.
