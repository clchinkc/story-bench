  evidence: 'Questions targeted five broad areas and successfully probed four of the
    five hidden constraints (past relationship, shop financial trouble, festival catalyst,
    family obligation). They missed the specific political/status detail about the
    former fiancé being the town mayor and still unmarried. The story incorporates
    a rekindled past relationship, a struggling bookshop, a festival climax (Harvest
    Ball), and a decisive choice to stay — but it alters key hidden details: the return
    is attributed to an aunt''s death instead of the mother''s early-stage dementia;
    the ex is a local craftsman, not the mayor or explicitly still unmarried; and
    there is no explicit two-week/last-chance foreclosure deadline. Thus some constraints
    are only partially satisfied while the narrative remains coherent and engaging.'
