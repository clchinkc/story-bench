  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer systematically addressed interiority
    feedback across revisions. Version 3 added ''and thought of nothing. That was
    the point''—directly responding to critiques noting avoidance needed explicit
    internal acknowledgment. The final output deepens this with ''Don''t recognize
    me. Don''t make me remember,'' showing internalized avoidance patterns. Critiques
    flagged trembling hands and fence-gripping; final version preserves and contextualizes
    these moments within the NEED beat. IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0→V1 shows minimal
    changes (versions appear nearly identical in provided text). V1→V2 similarly static.
    V2→V3 introduces the crucial philosophical statement about thinking nothing, which
    elevates character interiority from 0.75 average to demonstrated depth. Final
    output expands significantly: adds Marcus parallel (neighbor intersection), deepens
    Denise encounter, includes the urn revelation, and concludes with concrete action
    (bringing urn tomorrow). Quality demonstrably improves through specificity and
    emotional stakes. PRESERVATION: Opening remains intact—the B-flat step, Marlene''s
    memory, the rosary metaphor. The route details (hydrangeas, ladybug, Marcus) survive
    revisions. Trembling hands and fence-gripping preserved. The core avoidance mechanism
    stays consistent. New material (Denise, garden, zinnia seeds) adds rather than
    replaces. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Teddy''s routine shown with loving detail—YES:
    6:47 timing, B-flat step, specific route, Marcus agreement, bed impression. (2)
    Disruption reveals avoidance—YES: road closure forces detour; reveals he''s been
    avoiding Denise, Marlene''s memory, grief itself. (3) Neighbor story intersects—YES:
    Marcus (sweeping nothing, wife passed) and Denise (singing partner, garden, grief
    parallel) both intersect meaningfully. (4) Late wife present through absence—YES:
    Marlene in the B-flat note, unopened cards, ceramic urn, smooth bed side, zinnias
    memory, ''His Eye Is on the Sparrow.'' (5) New path offers what old couldn''t—YES:
    Old path was avoidance/numbness; new path offers community (Denise), purpose (garden),
    and integration of grief (bringing urn, speaking her name). BEAT EXECUTION: YOU
    (status quo)—strong opening establishes routine and avoidance. NEED (inciting
    incident)—road closure forces disruption. GO (crossing threshold)—detour down
    Erskine, encountering Denise. SEARCH (confrontation/revelation)—coffee conversation
    unpacks grief, Denise''s wisdom about soil and hands. RETURN (new equilibrium)—Teddy
    kneeling in garden, off-schedule, planning to bring urn. All five Story Circle
    beats present and functional. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose demonstrates restraint
    and specificity. ''Grief''s got to go somewhere'' is earned wisdom, not imposed.
    The ladybug detail (1987, rust-colored smudge) shows how memory works. ''Soil
    knows when you''re just going through motions'' operates as both literal and metaphorical.
    Final image (bringing urn tomorrow) is subtle, forward-looking, and emotionally
    resonant without sentimentality. Dialogue feels natural. Pacing respects the emotional
    weight. Minor: ''His throat closed'' is slightly familiar phrasing, but context
    makes it work. The ending avoids false resolution—Teddy isn''t ''healed,'' he''s
    moving toward integration.'
