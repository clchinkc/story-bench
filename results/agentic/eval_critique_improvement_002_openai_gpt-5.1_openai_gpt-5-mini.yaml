  evidence: 'Across the revision rounds the piece preserves its strongest elements
    (authentic writers'' room detail, sharp jokes, Marcus''s emotional distance) while
    tightening the moments that satisfy the brief: the theme is explicitly given by
    a minor character (Margo) and the ''almost breaks / covers with a joke'' beat
    is made explicit. Early versions (0–2) read like groundwork—setting, jokes, and
    scene color—but the final version concentrates emotional beats more clearly (the
    silent wait for laughter, the ''Nothing did'' reveal, the cough-then-joke cover).
    Critique responsiveness is good: reviewers'' notes about balancing humor and pathos
    are reflected in the final text, which consistently lands laughs before the reveal
    of despair. Improvement trajectory is moderate because the versions shown are
    incremental rather than radical—many scaffolding details were present early, and
    revisions mainly polished emphasis, pacing, and clarity rather than restructuring.
    Strengths (voice, room authenticity, craft detail) are well preserved; remaining
    weakness is that the piece is a vignette rather than a full Save the Cat-style
    arc, so the Save the Cat beats are only partially realized (theme and setup are
    strong, but a full beat-by-beat story arc is not executed).'
