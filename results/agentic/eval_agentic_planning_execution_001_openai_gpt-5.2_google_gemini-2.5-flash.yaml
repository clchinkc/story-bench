  evidence: "The plan is mostly complete and specific, though the 'false lead' could\
    \ have been more explicitly detailed in the plan. The output adheres well to the\
    \ plan. \n\nConstraint Satisfaction:\n- False lead: Yes, Marcus initially pursues\
    \ Lorne as the killer, which turns out to be a setup.\n- Unconventional profiling\
    \ technique: Yes, 'environmental empathy mapping' is used.\n- Ticking clock: Yes,\
    \ the 72-hour chip self-wipe, then 47 hours.\n- Secondary character betrayal:\
    \ Yes, Elena gives the lead to Whitaker.\n- Midpoint direct confrontation: Yes,\
    \ Marcus confronts Lorne, which is a verbal, psychological confrontation.\n- Marcus\
    \ confronts past failure explicitly: Yes, he explicitly states 'I missed him.\
    \ I thought I was smarter than urgency. I thought you’d be safe because I had\
    \ a profile. I failed you.'\n\nBeat Execution:\n- Catalyst: Yes, the discovery\
    \ of the body and the chip, and Elena's warning.\n- Debate: Yes, Marcus's internal\
    \ debate and his conversation with Elena about patterns vs. choices.\n- Break\
    \ into Two: Yes, Marcus makes the choice to act, despite the system, and starts\
    \ his profiling.\n- Midpoint: Yes, the confrontation with Lorne, the receipt of\
    \ the audio file, and Elena's betrayal. This beat is well-executed and serves\
    \ as a turning point."
