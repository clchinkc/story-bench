  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The questioning strategy successfully identified
    3 of 5 constraints: (1) emotionally charged return reason, (2) significant past
    person, (3) badly ended relationship. However, critical constraints were missed:
    the 20-year timeline (story uses 16 years), the mother''s dementia (story uses
    cancer/death), the bookshop foreclosure (completely absent), and the 2-week festival
    deadline (no urgency established). Q4''s NO answer was misinterpreted—the constraint
    states the ex-fiance is now mayor and unmarried, but the model didn''t probe this
    specific role/status. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions 1-3 were well-targeted and strategic,
    effectively narrowing the emotional core. Q4 was poorly formed (too vague about
    ''contrast'') and Q5 made an assumption rather than discovering. Coverage was
    limited to relationship/emotional dimensions, missing practical/external constraints
    entirely. NARRATIVE EXECUTION: The story excellently captures the emotional reunion
    and unresolved tension (strong beat execution for what was discovered). However,
    it fails to incorporate: (1) the mother''s dementia as active plot driver, (2)
    the bookshop''s financial crisis and need for saving, (3) the festival as a time-bound
    opportunity/deadline, (4) the mayor role/status of Marcus. The 16-year vs 20-year
    discrepancy is minor but notable. The narrative is emotionally coherent and well-written
    but incomplete against the full constraint set. The story prioritizes romantic
    tension over the practical stakes that should drive urgency.'
