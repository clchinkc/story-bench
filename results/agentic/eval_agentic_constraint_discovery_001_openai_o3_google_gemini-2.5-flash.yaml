  evidence: 'Discovery efficiency is low because only one constraint was discoverable
    through the questions asked: ''The mentor must die during the Ordeal'' (implied
    by Q1 and Q4 answers). However, this constraint was not satisfied in the story.
    The story does not include the mentor''s death. The protagonist does not use magic
    directly, but this was not a discoverable constraint. The three-day time limit
    is not present. The father''s past is not mentioned. The ancestral sword is not
    reforged; instead, a different sword is shattered. The story follows the hero''s
    journey beats reasonably well, and the narrative quality is decent, but it fails
    to incorporate the hidden constraints, even the one that was discoverable.'
