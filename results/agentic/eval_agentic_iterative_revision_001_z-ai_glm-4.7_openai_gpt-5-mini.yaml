  evidence: Version 0 established a strong, brusque opening but was cut off. Versions
    1 and 2 began to add interiority but remained incomplete. Version 3 tightened
    imagery and introduced the quieter turn toward Elena's interior life. The Final
    integrates a concrete medical detail (incentive spirometer, diaphragm technique,
    piston movement), preserves the opening competence, and develops a believable,
    earned human connection with Mr. Gable that prompts an internal shift. The ending
    maintains ambiguity (she hesitates over the message), satisfying the requirement
    that change be internal and unresolved.
