  evidence: 'The final output demonstrates exceptional constraint satisfaction. Elena''s
    competence is established through the opening sequence (supply chain resolution,
    ambulance redirects, bed utilization management) before her flaw emerges—isolation
    masquerading as professionalism. The friendship with Maria feels genuinely earned
    through vulnerability and shared history (Chopin, the daughter''s recital, the
    scheduling software that enabled Maria''s presence). The medical detail (nystagmus,
    the penlight test, dehydration diagnosis) serves the narrative by forcing Elena
    into the patient role and creating the conditions for connection. Elena''s transformation
    is internal—she doesn''t change jobs or appearance, but her relationship to connection
    shifts from avoidance to tentative openness. The ending achieves ambiguity: she
    still answers work calls mid-conversation, still has the reflexive impulse to
    her tablet, but she ''keeps walking beside Maria'' and asks about Sofia''s concert.
    Has she truly changed or is this a momentary crack? The revision trajectory shows
    strong improvement from the truncated versions (0-2) to the final output, which
    completes the narrative arc. The opening metaphor (''like weather'') is preserved
    throughout, maintaining stylistic consistency. The dialogue feels natural and
    earned rather than expository. The pacing—from crisis management to collapse to
    connection—creates proper narrative momentum. Minor limitation: the transformation,
    while internal, could arguably be read as slightly more external than ideal (the
    coffee invitation, the laugh), though this is mitigated by the ambiguity of whether
    it will persist.'
