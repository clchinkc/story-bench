  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.3): The three critiques all scored highly
    (0.82-1.0) on constraint satisfaction, yet the revision versions provided appear
    identical to VERSION 0 in the excerpt shown. No visible improvements were made
    across revisions despite receiving feedback. This suggests either: (a) critiques
    were not meaningfully acted upon, or (b) revisions occurred but weren''t reflected
    in the provided versions. The final output does show stronger execution than the
    initial excerpt, but the revision trajectory itself is opaque.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.2): Versions 0-3 appear nearly identical in the provided
    text samples. The final output shows significant enhancement (stronger fog integration,
    clearer character secrets, better pacing), but this appears to be a jump rather
    than incremental improvement across documented revisions. The trajectory should
    show progressive refinement; instead it shows stasis then sudden quality leap.


    PRESERVATION (0.5): Core strengths (Sarah''s methodical action sequences, atmospheric
    fog descriptions, the ring discovery) are maintained throughout. However, the
    revision process documentation is insufficient to assess whether weaknesses were
    systematically addressed while preserving strengths.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.8 / 4 of 5):

    ✓ Constraint 1 (Methodical nature through action): Excellent. ''Arranged evidence
    bags in precise rows,'' ''photographed each piece from three angles,'' ''examination
    from extremities inward,'' ''counting telephone poles''—all show rather than tell.

    ✓ Constraint 2 (Fog serves narrative purpose): Strong. Fog enables Morrison''s
    boat reveal, marks time cycles, creates tension around visibility and evidence
    preservation, affects investigation logistics.

    ✓ Constraint 3 (Local character with secret): Satisfied. Morrison''s involvement
    in the crime (implied through boat positioning, dismissive attitude, witness departure)
    is the central secret.

    ✓ Constraint 4 (Past case hinted before revealed): Satisfied. Boston Globe headline
    about corruption trials, the face-down case file about Margaret, the tremor response—all
    precede the ring discovery.

    ✗ Constraint 5 (End on decision, not resolution): PARTIALLY FAILED. The story
    ends ''Sarah reached for her evidence kit and made her choice.'' This is ambiguous—it''s
    unclear what choice she''s making. Is it to confront Morrison? Collect evidence?
    The decision moment lacks clarity. A stronger ending would show her choosing a
    specific action with clear stakes (e.g., ''Sarah''s hand moved toward her radio,
    then stopped. She looked at Morrison''s boat, then at the pier. Fifteen minutes.
    She turned toward the pier'' would be clearer).


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.75):

    - Setup beat (Sarah''s methodical work): Excellent execution with strong sensory
    detail and character voice.

    - Complication beat (body discovery, ring recognition): Well-executed with emotional
    resonance and mystery deepening.

    - Decision beat (confrontation choice): Adequately executed but lacks the crystalline
    clarity needed for maximum impact. The final paragraph is somewhat vague about
    what ''choice'' means.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.8): Prose is engaging and atmospheric. Character voice is
    distinct. Pacing accelerates effectively. The fog metaphor works on multiple levels
    (literal weather, Sarah''s confusion, investigation obscurity). Dialogue feels
    natural. The twist (Morrison''s involvement) lands with impact. Minor weakness:
    the final decision moment could be more visceral and specific.'
