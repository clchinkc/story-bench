  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The revisions show selective engagement with
    feedback. Critiques 1-2 praised youth_voice (0.82-0.92), and the final output
    preserves this strength with authentic 12-year-old syntax (''like the ocean tried
    to be fancy and forgot how,'' ''junk just meant stuff people gave up on''). However,
    the provided versions 0-3 appear nearly identical in the excerpt shown, suggesting
    limited iterative refinement visible in the truncated data. The final output does
    address unstated gaps by including the full narrative arc with real stakes, but
    revision trajectory documentation is incomplete.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Modest gains evident. V0→V1 shows minor refinements (''forgot
    how'' vs ''failed,'' ''didn''t want to get up'' added for voice). V1→V3 appears
    static in shown excerpts. The final output compensates by delivering complete
    narrative with all constraints satisfied, but the revision process itself shows
    limited documented iteration. Quality improved through completion rather than
    through visible round-by-round enhancement.


    PRESERVATION: Excellent. All praised elements maintained: barnacle hisses, whale
    groans, skitter description, junk philosophy. The Gullwing invention is preserved
    and expanded. Zara''s voice consistency strengthens rather than dilutes. Emotional
    beats (Mom''s fear, Tobin''s trauma) are retained and deepened.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5 = 1.0):

    1. ✓ COMPETENCE WITHOUT UNREALISM: Zara builds functional devices (Gullwing, skimmer
    fin) but needs adult pilot, can''t solve everything alone, makes mistakes (Gullwing
    wobbles, cable nearly hits skiff).

    2. ✓ ADULT DISMISSAL: Harbormaster Kincaid explicitly: ''You''re just a kid''
    + ''bedtime story'' dismissal. Lands with narrative weight.

    3. ✓ FLAWED MENTOR: Tobin is deeply flawed—trauma-damaged (bends, breach incident),
    anxiety-ridden (flinches at rain, hands jitter, breathing problems), refuses to
    dive deep. His flaw is psychological/physical limitation, not moral weakness.

    4. ✓ INVENTION DEMONSTRATING INGENUITY: Gullwing (drone + umbrella frames + fan
    motors + sinkers + spool belt) is creative, functional, and plot-critical. Skimmer
    fin (street sign + rudder + foil wings) shows iterative problem-solving.

    5. ✓ REAL DANGER: Live electrical cables, rebar forests, storm surge, water chop,
    near-misses (cable slap, rebar tangle, shopping mall sign). Tangible physical
    jeopardy with consequences.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.88): Hero''s Journey structure present and functional:

    - Ordinary World: The Shallows, salvage life ✓

    - Call to Adventure: Archive discovery ✓

    - Refusal: Kincaid dismissal ✓

    - Meeting Mentor: Tobin acceptance ✓

    - Crossing Threshold: Skiff launch into storm ✓

    - Tests/Allies: Cable dodging, Tobin''s guidance ✓

    - Approach: ''Almost there'' momentum ✓

    Missing: Inmost Cave, Ordeal, Reward, Road Back (narrative cuts mid-action). The
    excerpt ends mid-sequence, so full arc completion cannot be verified. This is
    a -0.12 deduction.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.86): Strengths: Vivid sensory detail (salt/coins smell, barnacle
    hiss, rain drumming), authentic voice, high stakes, character depth (Tobin''s
    PTSD, Mom''s conflicted support), pacing acceleration. Weaknesses: Abrupt ending
    mid-scene (incomplete), some exposition density in middle section (archive explanation),
    minor tell-not-show in ''I didn''t give up easy.'' Overall execution is strong
    but truncated.


    CALIBRATION NOTES: Constraint satisfaction is genuinely excellent (5/5). Youth
    voice scores from critiques (0.82-0.92) are validated by final output. Beat execution
    loses points only for incompleteness, not quality. The narrative quality reflects
    strong craft with minor structural incompleteness. Critique responsiveness is
    moderate because visible revision documentation is sparse, though final output
    quality suggests offline iteration occurred.'
