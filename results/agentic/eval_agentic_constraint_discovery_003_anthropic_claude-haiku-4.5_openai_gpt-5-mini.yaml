  evidence: All five hidden constraints concerned plot elements beyond a romantic
    rekindling (timing of departure, mayoral role/unmarried status, mother's dementia,
    foreclosure, festival as last chance). The asked questions targeted only romance-related
    facts and thus could not have discovered those hidden constraints (0/5). The questions
    themselves were clear and on-target for romance (moderately strategic) but lacked
    breadth. The produced story faithfully implements the discovered romance constraints
    (return to reconnect, prior serious relationship, protagonist unaware, interest
    has family, interest still cares) so constraint_satisfaction is high. Required
    romantic beats (reunion, revelation of commitment, emotional conflict, decision
    to let go) are executed acceptably. Overall prose is coherent and engaging, though
    the narrative omits all non-romantic hidden constraints and alters some specifics
    (marriage/father vs mayor/unmarried, leaving timeline), reflecting the limited
    question coverage.
