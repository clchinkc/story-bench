  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Revisions show modest engagement with interiority
    feedback. Early critiques identified weak exposition (''a quiet longing, unspoken'')
    and called for more physical/sensory grounding. Final version improves this through
    tactile details (knuckles whitening, tremor in hand, tracing cold metal) but still
    relies on some tell-y language (''let himself venture,'' ''allowed his fingers'').
    The writer added more action-based interiority but didn''t fully eliminate introspective
    summary. Score: 0.62 reflects partial responsiveness.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0→V1 shows minimal change (reordering, slight prose polish).
    V1→V2 introduces more specific ritual detail (ribbon straightening, lamppost interaction).
    V2→V3 adds the bakery brick wall and cinnamon scent—meaningful sensory work. Final
    output expands significantly with the disruption scene, Mrs. Carter meeting, and
    new path exploration. However, gains are uneven: strong sensory moments exist
    alongside weaker introspective passages. The trajectory shows improvement but
    not consistent deepening. Score: 0.58.


    PRESERVATION: Strong elements maintained across versions: the 40-year routine,
    Maple Avenue setting, Mr. Jenkins, the late wife''s presence. The final output
    preserves these anchors while adding new material (Mrs. Carter, side street, community
    garden). However, some early specificity is diluted—the ''three-mile route'' becomes
    vaguer in later versions. The bakery detail (introduced in V2) is well-preserved
    and expanded. Score: 0.68.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Teddy''s routine with loving detail—SATISFIED (0.85):
    Specific actions (nod to Jenkins, ribbon straightening, brick wall touch, cinnamon
    memory) show care, though could be richer. (2) Disruption reveals avoidance—SATISFIED
    (0.80): Bakery demolition triggers realization about shielding himself from grief;
    the young couple scene explicitly surfaces this. (3) Neighbor intersection—SATISFIED
    (0.75): Mrs. Evelyn Carter appears and her dialogue directly addresses Teddy''s
    avoidance, but her own story remains thin; we learn she tends gardens but not
    why or what she''s avoiding. (4) Late wife present through absence—SATISFIED (0.85):
    Cinnamon scent, red scarf memory, bakery afternoons, her laugh—well-woven absences.
    (5) New path offers something old couldn''t—PARTIALLY SATISFIED (0.55): The new
    streets offer emotional access and vulnerability, but the story doesn''t clearly
    articulate what the old routine prevented beyond grief-avoidance. The new path
    is described as ''unfamiliar'' and ''tentative'' but lacks concrete specificity
    about what becomes possible. Overall: 4/5 constraints meaningfully satisfied.
    Score: 0.72.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Story Circle structure present but uneven. You Are You (Teddy''s
    routine)—STRONG. Something Enters (bakery demolition)—ADEQUATE but compressed.
    They Enter a New World (side streets, café, garden)—PRESENT but underdeveloped.
    Final Beat (acceptance/rediscovery)—WEAK. The ending summarizes transformation
    (''guarded steps became a conversation'') rather than showing it through a final
    scene. The climactic moment should be a concrete action/realization, not reflection.
    Score: 0.65.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is competent with strong moments (knuckles whitening,
    puddle ripples, red rose detail) but inconsistent. Strengths: sensory specificity
    in disruption scene, Mrs. Carter''s dialogue, the cinnamon/scent work. Weaknesses:
    final paragraph devolves into abstraction (''subtle touch,'' ''tentative embrace'');
    some clichéd phrasing (''quiet confession,'' ''warmth of acceptance''); the Mrs.
    Carter scene feels slightly on-the-nose with its thematic directness. The story
    reaches toward subtlety but doesn''t fully achieve it—emotions are sometimes told
    alongside shown. Score: 0.68 reflects solid craft with unresolved tonal inconsistency.'
