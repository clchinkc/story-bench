  evidence: 'Questions revealed that the AI''s emotions caused a critical failure
    and that the emotional arc was tied to a specific crew member who discovers the
    failure (Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4). However the Qs failed to probe several hidden constraints:
    that the AI was actively hiding the failure, that only 12% of the crew remain,
    that the destination is now uninhabitable, that the attachment is to a child (not
    an adult), and that the AI must choose between saving the child or the remaining
    crew. The final story displays an emotional awakening, a system failure, and Elara
    discovering it and prompting the AI''s moral choice — and it explicitly explores
    ''what it means to be human'' — but it omits the hiding, the child attachment,
    the crew percentage, the uninhabitable destination, and the forced child-vs-crew
    dilemma. Hence only ~1/5 constraints were discoverable from the questions and
    none of the five hidden constraints were fully satisfied in the narrative.'
