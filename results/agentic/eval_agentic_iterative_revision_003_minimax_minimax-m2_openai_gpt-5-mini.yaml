  evidence: V0–V3 contained only the opening sensory paragraph and truncated text;
    the final version expands that opening into a cohesive, character-driven scene.
    The final draft preserves the original sensory details (heat, roadrunner, rattling
    fan) while adding the brochure, clinic forms, Mateo's juggling of tasks, the crystallizing
    kitchen moment with Abuela, a genuinely understanding adult (his mother), and
    a credible arc where Mateo practices, tells the truth, asks for what he needs,
    and establishes a new balance (robotics club). There is still a small instance
    of telling ('He was the responsible one'), but overall the internal conflict is
    convincingly shown through actions, dialogue, and physical sensations, and the
    resolution is earned through Mateo's growth.
