  evidence: 'Version 0 is a sparse scene-establishing draft with telling (he had never
    told anyone) and little emotional payoff. Version 1 shows minimal visible change.
    Version 2 introduces Abuela, Spanish phrasing, and concrete stakes (deadline,
    doctor), shifting from pure scene-setting to an emotional center. The final (Version
    3 / final output) expands that center into a crystallizing moment: Abuela pulling
    out the crumpled flyer and urging him to go — this both externalizes and resolves
    the conflict, and Mr. Alvarez and Abuela are shown as adults who understand. Cultural
    touches (Spanish lines, familial roles, translating at the clinic) feel authentic
    and specific. Preservation: the setting, scholarship motif, and beats from earlier
    drafts remain. Remaining weakness: a few lines still ''tell'' rather than fully
    show (e.g., “He couldn’t tell Mr. Alvarez the choice felt like tearing himself
    in half” and “He just *knew*”), which prevents perfect fulfillment of the ''show,
    don’t tell'' constraint.'
