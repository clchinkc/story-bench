  evidence: 'Discovery efficiency: 3 out of 5 constraints were discoverable. The questions
    successfully identified the protagonist''s craft, the nature of the darkness,
    and the artifact reforging. The questions did not touch upon the mentor''s death,
    the time limit, or the father''s past. Question quality: Questions were generally
    well-formed and strategic, directly targeting specific aspects of the story. Question
    coverage: Coverage was decent for the aspects it touched upon, but missed several
    key hidden constraints. Constraint satisfaction: The story successfully incorporated
    the protagonist''s blacksmithing, the metaphorical darkness, and the reforging
    of an artifact. It did not incorporate the mentor''s death, the time limit, or
    the father''s past. Beat execution: The story clearly delineates and executes
    the Call to Adventure, Crossing the Threshold, Ordeal, and Resolution beats. Narrative
    quality: The narrative is coherent and engaging, with a clear arc. The description
    of the ''darkness'' as a metaphorical rot of the soul is well-executed, and the
    resolution through craftsmanship is satisfying.'
