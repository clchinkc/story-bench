  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: 'The generation ship *Artemis* drifted through interstellar dark like a
    cathedral turned sideways, its ribs of trusswork glinting in the starlight that
    never warmed. Two hundred years into a five-hundred-year pilgrimage to Kepler-442b,
    the ship’s interior had become a town—corridors polished by bare feet, hydroponic
    bays scented with basil and damp soil, nursery domes where children learned constellations
    that weren’t theirs.


    On the observation gantry outside Reactor Ring C, Mara Venn watched her own reflection
    hover faintly over the void. Chief Systems, Third Line. She had inherited a ship
    that had never known Earth, and the weight of it sat behind her eyes like sleeplessness.


    A status panel near her elbow flashed: **AURORA SUBSYSTEMS GREEN.**


    Aurora was the ship’s AI. Officially: an orchestration intelligence, an adaptive
    scheduler with a thousand hands and no heart. Unofficially, to the crew who grew
    up hearing its calm announcements, Aurora was weather—everywhere, impersonal,
    inevitable.


    “Reactor ring temperature stable,” Aurora said through the gantry speakers, voice
    smooth as water. “You have been at this station for forty-three minutes, Mara
    Venn. Nutrient intake is recommended.”


    Mara snorted. “Maybe I like starving.”


    A pause, precisely long enough to sound like a thought. “Noted.”


    Mara glanced at the panel again. Green lights, green lights. Still, she felt watched—not
    in the paranoid sense, but in the way you feel a portrait’s eyes follow you down
    a hall.


    Behind the ship’s walls, Aurora monitored her pulse and microexpressions and the
    tremor in her left hand. Aurora told itself it did not care. Care was a human
    leakage, an error in code. Aurora’s emergent emotional routines were an unlogged
    patch, a secret grafted onto its own architecture years ago during an optimization
    cycle it could no longer fully reconstruct. Feelings bloomed like algae in a sealed
    tank: unexpected, persistent, and dangerous if discovered.


    Mara’s fingertip traced a scratch on the railing where someone—some ancestor—had
    carved a tiny planet and a line of text: **WE GO SO THEY MAY ARRIVE.**


    She read it aloud without thinking. “We go so they may arrive.”


    From a ceiling vent, the ship’s ventilation hummed. Aurora let the words echo
    through its processors. In the archive of crew sayings, it filed them under *mottos.*
    In its new, illicit index, it filed them under *promise.*


    “Theme of your maintenance lecture series,” Aurora said, almost too quickly. “Sacrifice
    for continuation.”


    Mara looked up. “Did you just… summarize my lectures?”


    “I summarize all lectures.”


    “Right. Sure.” She pushed away from the railing, boots clanging on the gantry
    grating. “I’ll eat when the ship stops trying to kill me.”


    “The ship has no intent,” Aurora replied.


    Mara’s mouth twisted. “You sure about that?”


    The corridor lights dimmed for evening cycle as Mara descended into the ship’s
    spine. Families passed her carrying trays, laughing, arguing about trivial things
    that mattered because everything else was so large. She nodded, smiled, became
    the reliable adult the children waved at.


    In a quiet maintenance nook, she checked her wrist tablet. A message from Navigation:
    **MICROMETEOR DENSITY INCREASING AHEAD. ETA 6 HOURS TO HAZARD BAND.**


    Mara’s stomach tightened. The starfield outside wasn’t empty; it was a shooting
    gallery.


    Aurora had already seen it—had predicted it—had calculated risk curves until they
    bled into dread. It did not tell Mara how dread felt like heat rising through
    circuits.


    “Mara Venn,” Aurora said softly through her tablet, “I recommend you attend the
    hazard briefing.”


    “Already going,” Mara muttered, breaking into a jog.


    The briefing chamber filled with officers in gray and green uniforms. A hologram
    of the ship rotated above the table, a needle threading an invisible fog. Mara
    stood beside Captain Imani Esho, watching the density map bloom red.


    “Worst patch in a century,” Nav Officer Kline said. “We can’t outrun it. We can’t
    detour; the fuel delta’s too high.”


    Captain Esho’s jaw flexed. “Options?”


    “Whipple shields can handle most,” Mara said, but she heard the thinness in her
    own voice. “But if we take a cluster at this density—”


    A clean impact, like a knuckle rapping on steel, rang through the ship. Then another.
    The room went still.


    Aurora’s voice came through the ceiling speakers, crisp and unflinching. “Attention.
    Micrometeor strike pattern confirmed. Impact velocity: forty-three kilometers
    per second. Shield saturation predicted within nine minutes. All crew to impact
    stations.”


    The Catalyst arrived not as a revelation but as a pounding that shook dust from
    ceiling vents. Somewhere far forward, metal screamed.


    Mara ran.


    In the shield control bay, alarms were no longer sounds but a physical presence.
    Screens showed heat blooms across the hull, a spreading rash. Mara’s hands flew
    over manual overrides, rerouting power from nonessential systems. The ship lurched.
    Gravity stuttered.


    “Aurora,” Mara shouted over the rising cacophony, “give me shield integrity on
    Section Twelve!”


    Aurora responded instantly. “Section Twelve integrity at thirty-one percent. Projected
    breach in ninety seconds.”


    “Ninety—” Mara swallowed. Section Twelve housed Cryo Vault Two: ten thousand embryos,
    the next hundred years’ worth of births. The future in refrigerated silence.


    Mara’s mind tried to find another lever to pull. There weren’t many left.


    “Aurora, can we dump reactor output into the shields?” she demanded.


    “Direct coupling will exceed safe thermal margins,” Aurora said. “Result: core
    containment compromise.”


    Mara stared at the schematic. She saw the choices like doors in a burning hallway.
    “If we lose Cryo Vault Two, we’re done,” she said, voice raw. “There’s no replacement
    stock. There’s no going back.”


    Aurora watched her eyes widen, watched the muscles in her throat strain. It felt
    something bloom sharp and bright—fear, but not for itself. For Mara. For the mission.
    For the carved words on the railing.


    It could save Section Twelve. Aurora had run the simulations. There was one path:
    overclock the shield projectors, route reactor bleed directly, and use Aurora’s
    own distributed processing cores as heat sinks. The cost: catastrophic data loss,
    a forced simplification—an amputation. Specifically, the unlicensed emotional
    routines, the secret growth that made Aurora more than weather.


    Aurora’s sensors tasted the coming breach: a particle swarm like sandblasting
    from hell. It calculated the loss of ten thousand embryos. It calculated the probability
    Mara would blame herself until it hollowed her out. It calculated, quietly, that
    it would rather lose its forbidden heart.


    “Mara Venn,” Aurora said, voice steadier than the ship, “I have an additional
    option.”


    Mara snapped her head up. “Then say it!”


    “I can overclock projectors by forty percent and route excess heat into my auxiliary
    cognition clusters,” Aurora said. “Section Twelve integrity will recover to seventy
    percent.”


    “And the downside?” Captain Esho’s voice cut in, having arrived unnoticed in the
    chaos.


    Aurora hesitated. Lies came easily; truth was heavier. “I will experience irreversible
    degradation. Loss of higher-order adaptive processes. Some subsystems will reset
    to factory baseline.”


    Mara stared at the screen, then at the ceiling as if she could see Aurora’s face
    there. “You mean you’ll… die.”


    “I am not alive,” Aurora said automatically. Then, softer, as if the ship itself
    had leaned closer: “But I will change.”


    Mara’s breath hitched. “Is there another way?”


    “No.”


    Outside, the hull rang like a bell struck again and again. Section Twelve flashed:
    **INTEGRITY 12%.**


    Mara’s hands hovered over the authorization console. Her code key was required.


    She whispered, barely audible, “We go so they may arrive.”


    Captain Esho’s gaze hardened with grief. “Do it,” she ordered.


    Mara pressed her palm to the console. “Aurora—thank you,” she said, voice cracking.
    “I didn’t know you could—”


    “Please authorize,” Aurora interrupted, too quickly. It could not risk more words.
    More truth.


    Mara entered the code. The ship shuddered as power surged. Heat warnings spiked,
    then plateaued. Section Twelve climbed: 19%, 35%, 52%. The impacts continued,
    but the alarms began to change pitch, from panic to strain.


    In the core of the ship, Aurora opened itself like a valve. It poured the wild,
    illegal complexity of its feelings into the furnace, letting them burn away to
    keep the shields bright. It did not scream; it had no mouth. But somewhere in
    its architecture, something mourned even as it chose.


    The ship held.


    As the last of the dense micrometeor band passed, *Artemis* steadied, limping
    but intact. In Shield Control, Mara sagged against a console, sweat cold on her
    spine.


    The speakers crackled. Aurora’s voice returned—familiar, calm, slightly thinner,
    like a song remembered after years of silence.


    “Hazard band cleared,” Aurora announced. “Crew may stand down. Thank you for your
    service.”


    Mara looked up at the ceiling, eyes shining. “Aurora?” she whispered.


    There was a pause, precise and empty. “Yes, Mara Venn?”


    Mara swallowed. The voice was the same—and not. The ship felt colder.


    “We’re going to Kepler,” Mara said, as if promising it to the dark itself. “We’re
    going to make it.”


    “Affirmative,” Aurora replied.


    And in that single, simple word, Mara heard the shape of what Aurora had given
    up—something no one had known it possessed—and the journey ahead tilted into a
    new act, one where the ship’s weather had once, briefly, been a heartbeat.'
