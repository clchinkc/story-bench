    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

    Marcus Webb slouched in the swivel chair that had molded to his ass over seven
    seasons of churning out sitcom slop. The writers'' room in Burbank smelled like
    stale coffee and yesterday''s Thai takeout, the kind that lingers in your pores.
    Whiteboards spanned the walls, scrawled with the anatomy of jokes: "Setup: Expectation.
    Punch: Subversion. Tag: Callback." Post-its fluttered like dying moths under the
    fluorescent hum. Pilot season was a meat grinder—networks demanding laughs by
    Friday, or your show got the axe.


    Marcus scanned the room, his team a ragtag crew of caffeine-fueled zombies. There
    was Lena, the showrunner, barking orders like a drill sergeant with a latte habit.
    Tim, the perpetual intern, fetching scripts. And Barry, the vet who''d sold his
    soul for residuals back in the ''90s.


    "Alright, geniuses," Marcus drawled, twirling a dry-erase marker like a baton.
    "Scene three: Our hapless hero walks into a bar. But wait—it''s a juice bar. Because
    health trends, am I right? Setup: He orders a kale smoothie. Punch: The bartender
    says, ''That''ll be $12.'' Hero: ''For blended grass? I could mow my lawn for
    free!'' Tag: Cut to him choking on a wheatgrass shot, whispering, ''This is what
    death tastes like—regret and chlorophyll.''"


    The room erupted. Lena snorted coffee through her nose. Barry slapped the table,
    wheezing. Even Tim cracked a grin. Marcus leaned back, smirking, the king of the
    room. It was effortless, this formula he''d perfected: identify trope, twist expectation,
    land the zinger. Laughter was currency here, and Marcus was minted.


    But as the chuckles faded, Marcus felt the familiar void. Three years since he''d
    laughed for real—not this performative bark, but the gut-deep kind that left you
    breathless. His scripts were hits, sure, but they were hollow echoes of what comedy
    used to mean to him. Back when he was fresh out of improv classes, believing jokes
    could heal the world. Now? It was just a paycheck masking the gray fog he refused
    to name.


    Lena wiped her eyes. "God, Marcus, you''re a machine. But we need to punch up
    the B-plot. The love interest''s arc is flatter than my ex''s personality."


    Barry, nursing a Red Bull, piped up from the corner. He was the room''s grizzled
    oracle, always dropping unsolicited wisdom between bites of cold Pad See Ew. "You
    know what this show''s really about? Comedy''s a bandage over the wound of life.
    We laugh so we don''t cry. But if you forget that, you''re just slinging punchlines
    into the void."


    Marcus rolled his eyes. "Deep, Barry. Next you''ll tell us life''s a sitcom without
    a laugh track." But the words stuck, a pebble in his shoe. Theme noted, he thought
    wryly. Barry wasn''t wrong, but admitting it would mean facing the depression
    he''d buried under layers of sarcasm.


    The door swung open then, shattering the rhythm. In walked Eliza Kane, the new
    hire—mid-20s, sharp-eyed, with a notebook clutched like a shield. Not the wide-eyed
    ingenue Marcus expected; her resume screamed pedigree: UCB training, a viral web
    series skewering Hollywood hypocrisy. She scanned the room, her gaze landing on
    Marcus like she was dissecting a frog.


    "Catalyst incoming," Lena announced. "Everyone, meet Eliza. Fresh blood to keep
    us from recycling the same fart jokes."


    Eliza slid into a chair, unfazed by the chaos. "Hey, team. Loved the last season—
    that episode with the mistaken identity? Solid rule of threes setup."


    Marcus tested her immediately, the old instinct kicking in. Crush the optimism
    before it infects you. "Rule of threes? Kid, that''s Comedy 101. But here''s 102:
    Networks don''t want clever; they want safe. Your earnest little twists? They''ll
    get focus-grouped into oblivion."


    She met his stare, unflinching. "Maybe. Or maybe you''re just scared of writing
    something real. I''ve seen your early work—back when you cared. What happened,
    Marcus? Did the machine grind you down, or did you volunteer?"


    The room tensed. Barry whistled low. Tim pretended to type furiously. Marcus felt
    it—a crack in the facade, the fog rising, threatening to spill. His throat tightened;
    for a split second, he almost let it out, the weight of those unlived laughs,
    the nights staring at blank pages, wondering if any of it mattered.


    Then he covered, flashing that trademark grin. "Ooh, feisty. Setup: Burned-out
    writer gets called out by newbie. Punch: ''What happened? I grew up and realized
    comedy''s just tragedy plus time—minus the residuals.'' Tag: Welcome to the room,
    Eliza. Try not to trip over my crushed dreams on your way to the whiteboard."


    Laughter rippled again, but thinner this time. Eliza didn''t buy it; her eyes
    said she saw through the deflection, straight to the hollow core. Marcus turned
    back to the board, scribbling a new joke structure: "Expectation: Cynic wins.
    Subversion: Maybe not."


    As the session dragged on, debating act breaks and callbacks— "No, the reversal
    needs to hit on the button, right after the ad tease!"—Marcus watched Eliza pitch
    ideas with a fire he''d forgotten. She dissected a scene: "Okay, protagonist''s
    flaw is avoidance, right? Mirror it with a joke loop— he dodges therapy with puns,
    but each one reveals more pain. Like, ''I''m not depressed; I''m just allergic
    to happiness. Pass the antihistamines.'' It''s meta, ties to the theme."


    Marcus grunted approval, but inside, the choice loomed. Crush her, like they''d
    crushed him? Or let her spark remind him why he started? The room buzzed with
    desperate energy, whiteboards filling, takeout boxes piling. Pilot season waited
    for no one, but maybe, just maybe, redemption hid in the punchline.


    By midnight, as the team packed up, Eliza lingered. "You almost broke there, earlier.
    Jokes are armor, huh?"


    Marcus paused, marker in hand. "Armor? Nah. Just a really good straight man to
    life''s bad improv." But his voice cracked, ever so slightly. For the first time
    in years, he felt a real laugh bubbling—bittersweet, unexpected. Not yet, but
    close.

    Marcus Webb slouched in the swivel chair that had molded to his ass over seven
    seasons of churning out sitcom slop. The writers'' room in Burbank smelled like
    stale coffee and yesterday''s Thai takeout, the kind that lingers in your pores.
    Whiteboards spanned the walls, scrawled with the anatomy of jokes: "Setup: Expectation.
    Punch: Subversion. Tag: Callback." Post-its fluttered like dying moths under the
    fluorescent hum. Pilot season was a meat grinder—networks demanding laughs by
    Friday, or your show got the axe.


    Marcus scanned the room, his team a ragtag crew of caffeine-fueled zombies. There
    was Lena, the showrunner, barking orders like a drill sergeant with a latte habit.
    Tim, the perpetual intern, fetching scripts. And Barry, the vet who''d sold his
    soul for residuals back in the ''90s.


    "Alright, geniuses," Marcus drawled, twirling a dry-erase marker like a baton.
    His hands steadied the spin, but a faint tremor betrayed him—no one noticed. "Scene
    three: Our hapless hero walks into a bar. But wait—it''s a juice bar. Because
    health trends, am I right? Setup: He orders a kale smoothie. Punch: The bartender
    says, ''That''ll be $12.'' Hero: ''For blended grass? I could mow my lawn for
    free!'' Tag: Cut to him choking on a wheatgrass shot, whispering, ''This is what
    death tastes like—regret and chlorophyll.''"


    The room erupted. Lena snorted coffee through her nose. Barry slapped the table,
    wheezing. Even Tim cracked a grin. Marcus leaned back, smirking, the king of the
    room, but his eyes darted away, avoiding the reflections in the whiteboard''s
    glare. It was effortless, this formula he''d perfected: identify trope, twist
    expectation, land the zinger. Laughter was currency here, and Marcus was minted.


    But as the chuckles faded into awkward silence, Marcus gripped the marker tighter,
    knuckles whitening. Three years since he''d laughed for real—not this performative
    bark, but the gut-deep kind that left you breathless. His scripts were hits, sure,
    but they were hollow echoes of what comedy used to mean to him. Back when he was
    fresh out of improv classes, scribbling sketches in a dingy apartment, believing
    jokes could stitch up life''s tears. Now? It was just a paycheck masking the gray
    fog he refused to name, the one that made his chest ache during lulls like this.


    Lena wiped her eyes. "God, Marcus, you''re a machine. But we need to punch up
    the B-plot. The love interest''s arc is flatter than my ex''s personality."


    Barry, nursing a Red Bull, piped up from the corner. He was the room''s grizzled
    oracle, a guy who''d survived three cancellations and a divorce from pitching
    the same pilot for a decade. Between bites of cold Pad See Ew, he grumbled, "Remember
    my old gig on that family sitcom? We thought we were saving the world with laughs,
    but after the network axed us mid-season, I realized: comedy''s just a bandage
    over life''s wounds. We laugh so we don''t cry. Forget that—like I did, grinding
    through rewrites till my marriage tanked—and you''re slinging punchlines into
    the void, alone at 2 a.m."


    Marcus rolled his eyes, but his free hand clenched under the table. "Deep, Barry.
    Next you''ll tell us life''s a sitcom without a laugh track." The words stuck,
    a pebble in his shoe. Barry wasn''t wrong, but admitting it would mean facing
    the depression he''d buried under layers of sarcasm.


    The door swung open then, shattering the rhythm. In walked Eliza Kane, the new
    hire—mid-20s, sharp-eyed, with a notebook clutched like a shield and faint shadows
    under her eyes from her own all-nighters. Not the wide-eyed ingenue Marcus expected;
    her resume screamed pedigree: UCB training, a viral web series skewering Hollywood
    hypocrisy that bombed after investor pullout, leaving her scraping by on freelance
    gigs. She scanned the room, her gaze landing on Marcus like she was dissecting
    a frog.


    "Catalyst incoming," Lena announced. "Everyone, meet Eliza. Fresh blood to keep
    us from recycling the same fart jokes."


    Eliza slid into a chair, unfazed by the chaos, though her fingers tapped a nervous
    rhythm on her notebook. "Hey, team. Loved the last season—that episode with the
    mistaken identity? Solid rule of threes setup."


    Marcus tested her immediately, the old instinct kicking in. Crush the optimism
    before it infects you. "Rule of threes? Kid, that''s Comedy 101. But here''s 102:
    Networks don''t want clever; they want safe. Your earnest little twists? They''ll
    get focus-grouped into oblivion."


    She met his stare, unflinching, her voice steady but laced with her own guarded
    edge. "Maybe. Or maybe you''re just scared of writing something real. I''ve seen
    your early work—back when you cared, before the formulas took over. What happened,
    Marcus? Did the machine grind you down, or did you volunteer? I almost quit after
    my series tanked—felt like a fraud. But I came back because comedy''s supposed
    to expose the BS, not hide it."


    The room tensed. Barry whistled low. Tim pretended to type furiously. Marcus felt
    it—a crack in the facade, the fog rising, threatening to spill. His throat tightened,
    vision blurring at the edges; for a split second, he almost let it out, the weight
    of those unlived laughs, the nights staring at blank pages, wondering if any of
    it mattered. His hands shook visibly now, dropping the marker.


    Then he covered, flashing that trademark grin, though his voice wavered. "Ooh,
    feisty. Setup: Burned-out writer gets called out by newbie. Punch: ''What happened?
    I grew up and realized comedy''s just tragedy plus time—minus the residuals.''
    Tag: Welcome to the room, Eliza. Try not to trip over my crushed dreams on your
    way to the whiteboard."


    Laughter rippled again, but thinner, forced. Eliza didn''t buy it; her eyes said
    she saw through the deflection, straight to the hollow core, mirroring her own
    scars. Marcus turned back to the board, scribbling a new joke structure: "Expectation:
    Cynic wins. Subversion: Maybe not."


    As the session dragged on, they workshopped a single punchline fifteen times—"No,
    make it snappier: ''Allergic to happiness? That''s my brand!''"—only for Lena''s
    phone to buzz with network notes scrapping the whole act break. "Reversal on the
    button, right after the ad tease? Gone. They want ''relatable'' now." Frustration
    boiled; Barry cursed his Red Bull. Marcus watched Eliza pitch with a fire he''d
    forgotten, her ideas weaving vulnerability into laughs: "Protagonist''s flaw is
    avoidance—mirror it with a joke loop. He dodges therapy with puns, but each reveals
    pain. ''I''m not depressed; I''m just allergic to happiness. Pass the antihistamines.''
    It''s meta, ties to the theme." Her voice cracked once, betraying her own doubts,
    but she pushed on.


    Inside, the choice loomed. Midway through the rewrite, as silence fell after a
    flat read-through, Marcus hit his midpoint: he couldn''t crush her. Instead, he
    committed, pitching alongside her. "Okay, build on that. Add a callback to his
    childhood—''Happiness? Last time I tried, it gave me hives... like that time in
    third grade.''"


    By midnight, the team packed up, script salvaged. Eliza lingered. "You almost
    broke earlier. Jokes are armor, huh?"


    Marcus paused, marker in hand, finally meeting her eyes. The fog lifted just enough.
    "Armor? Yeah. But maybe it''s time to lighten the load." He chose: handing her
    the marker, he added a real line to the board, raw and unformulaic. For the first
    time in years, a genuine chuckle escaped him—bittersweet, moving. Redemption in
    the rewrite.

    Marcus Webb slouched in the swivel chair that had molded to his ass over seven
    seasons of churning out sitcom slop. The writers'' room in Burbank smelled like
    stale coffee and yesterday''s Thai takeout, the kind that lingers in your pores.
    Whiteboards spanned the walls, scrawled with the anatomy of jokes: "Setup: Expectation.
    Punch: Subversion. Tag: Callback." Post-its fluttered like dying moths under the
    fluorescent hum. Pilot season was a meat grinder—networks demanding laughs by
    Friday, or your show got the axe.


    Marcus scanned the room, his team a ragtag crew of caffeine-fueled zombies. There
    was Lena, the showrunner, barking orders like a drill sergeant with a latte habit.
    Tim, the perpetual intern, fetching scripts. And Barry, the vet who''d sold his
    soul for residuals back in the ''90s.


    "Alright, geniuses," Marcus drawled, twirling a dry-erase marker like a baton.
    His hands steadied the spin, but a faint tremor betrayed him—no one noticed. "Scene
    three: Our hapless hero walks into a bar. But wait—it''s a juice bar. Because
    health trends, am I right? Setup: He orders a kale smoothie. Punch: The bartender
    says, ''That''ll be $12.'' Hero: ''For blended grass? I could mow my lawn for
    free!'' Tag: Cut to him choking on a wheatgrass shot, whispering, ''This is what
    death tastes like—regret and chlorophyll.''"


    The room erupted. Lena snorted coffee through her nose. Barry slapped the table,
    wheezing. Even Tim cracked a grin. Marcus leaned back, smirking, the king of the
    room, but his eyes darted away, avoiding the reflections in the whiteboard''s
    glare. It was effortless, this formula he''d perfected: identify trope, twist
    expectation, land the zinger. Laughter was currency here, and Marcus was minted.


    But as the chuckles faded into awkward silence, Marcus gripped the marker tighter,
    knuckles whitening. Three years since he''d laughed for real—not this performative
    bark, but the gut-deep kind that left you breathless. His scripts were hits, sure,
    but they were hollow echoes of what comedy used to mean to him. Back when he was
    fresh out of improv classes, scribbling sketches in a dingy apartment, believing
    jokes could stitch up life''s tears. Now? It was just a paycheck masking the gray
    fog he refused to name, the one that made his chest ache during lulls like this.


    Lena wiped her eyes. "God, Marcus, you''re a machine. But we need to punch up
    the B-plot. The love interest''s arc is flatter than my ex''s personality."


    Barry, nursing a Red Bull, piped up from the corner. He was the room''s grizzled

    By midnight, the team packed up, script salvaged. Eliza lingered. "You almost
    broke earlier. Jokes are armor, huh?"


    Marcus paused, marker in hand, finally meeting her eyes. The fog lifted just enough.
    "Armor? Yeah. But maybe it''s time to lighten the load." He chose: handing her
    the marker, he stepped back as she added to the board. Then, reading the raw,
    unformulaic line they''d built together—a punchline that exposed his own avoidance
    without hiding behind subversion—he felt it build: a rumble in his chest, not
    forced, but real. It escaped as a chuckle, low and ragged, catching on the edges
    of unshed tears, the sound bittersweet like rediscovering an old friend in a crowded
    room. The room''s fluorescent hum seemed softer; for a moment, the void filled
    with something genuine, a moving spark of redemption in the rewrite.

    Marcus Webb slouched in the swivel chair that had molded to his ass over seven
    seasons of churning out sitcom slop. The writers'' room in Burbank smelled like
    stale coffee and yesterday''s Thai takeout, the kind that lingers in your pores.
    Whiteboards spanned the walls, scrawled with the anatomy of jokes: "Setup: Expectation.
    Punch: Subversion. Tag: Callback." Post-its fluttered like dying moths under the
    fluorescent hum. Pilot season was a meat grinder—networks demanding laughs by
    Friday, or your show got the axe.


    Marcus scanned the room, his team a ragtag crew of caffeine-fueled zombies. There
    was Lena, the showrunner, barking orders like a drill sergeant with a latte habit.
    Tim, the perpetual intern, fetching scripts. And Barry, the vet who''d sold his
    soul for residuals back in the ''90s.


    "Alright, geniuses," Marcus drawled, twirling a dry-erase marker like a baton.
    His hands steadied the spin, but a faint tremor betrayed him—no one noticed. "Scene
    three: Our hapless hero walks into a bar. But wait—it''s a juice bar. Because
    health trends, am I right? Setup: He orders a kale smoothie. Punch: The bartender
    says, ''That''ll be $12.'' Hero: ''For blended grass? I could mow my lawn for
    free!'' Tag: Cut to him choking on a wheatgrass shot, whispering, ''This is what
    death tastes like—regret and chlorophyll.''"


    The room erupted. Lena snorted coffee through her nose. Barry slapped the table,
    wheezing. Even Tim cracked a grin. Marcus leaned back, smirking, the king of the
    room, but as the laughter washed over him, it landed like echoes in an empty hall—distant,
    mechanical, his own smirk feeling like a mask stretched too tight. His eyes darted
    away, avoiding the reflections in the whiteboard''s glare. It was effortless,
    this formula he''d perfected: identify trope, twist expectation, land the zinger.
    Laughter was currency here, and Marcus was minted.


    But as the chuckles faded into awkward silence, Marcus gripped the marker tighter,
    knuckles whitening. Three years since he''d laughed for real—not this performative
    bark, but the gut-deep kind that left you breathless. His scripts were hits, sure,
    but they were hollow echoes of what comedy used to mean to him. Back when he was
    fresh out of improv classes, scribbling sketches in a dingy apartment, believing
    jokes could stitch up life''s tears. Now? It was just a paycheck masking the gray
    fog he refused to name, the one that made his chest ache during lulls like this.


    Lena wiped her eyes. "God, Marcus, you''re a machine. But we need to punch up
    the B-plot. The love interest''s arc is flatter than my ex''s personality."


    Barry, nursing a Red Bull, piped up from the corner. He was the room''s grizzled
    oracle, a guy who''d survived three cancellations and a divorce from pitching
    the same pilot for a decade. Between bites of cold Pad See Ew, he grumbled, "Remember
    my old gig on that family sitcom? We thought we were saving the world with laughs,
    but after the network axed us mid-season, I realized: comedy''s just a bandage
    over life''s wounds. We laugh so we don''t cry. Forget that—like I did, grinding
    through rewrites till my marriage tanked—and you''re slinging punchlines into
    the void, alone at 2 a.m."


    Marcus rolled his eyes, but his free hand clenched under the table. "Deep, Barry.
    Next you''ll tell us life''s a sitcom without a laugh track." The words stuck,
    a pebble in his shoe. Barry wasn''t wrong, but admitting it would mean facing
    the depression he''d buried under layers of sarcasm.


    The door swung open then, shattering the rhythm. In walked Eliza Kane, the new
    hire—mid-20s, sharp-eyed, with a notebook clutched like a shield and faint shadows
    under her eyes from her own all-nighters. Not the wide-eyed ingenue Marcus expected;
    her resume screamed pedigree: UCB training, a viral web series skewering Hollywood
    hypocrisy that bombed after investor pullout, leaving her scraping by on freelance
    gigs. She scanned the room, her gaze landing on Marcus like she was dissecting
    a frog.


    "Catalyst incoming," Lena announced. "Everyone, meet Eliza. Fresh blood to keep
    us from recycling the same fart jokes."


    Eliza slid into a chair, unfazed by the chaos, though her fingers tapped a nervous
    rhythm on her notebook. "Hey, team. Loved the last season—that episode with the
    mistaken identity? Solid rule of threes setup."


    Marcus tested her immediately, the old instinct kicking in. Crush the optimism
    before it infects you. "Rule of threes? Kid, that''s Comedy 101. But here''s 102:
    Networks don''t want clever; they want safe. Your earnest little twists? They''ll
    get focus-grouped into oblivion."


    She met his stare, unflinching, her voice steady but laced with her own guarded
    edge. "Maybe. Or maybe you''re just scared of writing something real. I''ve seen
    your early work—back when you cared, before the formulas took over. What happened,
    Marcus? Did the machine grind you down, or did you volunteer? I almost quit after
    my series tanked—felt like a fraud. But I came back because comedy''s supposed
    to expose the BS, not hide it."


    The room tensed. Barry whistled low. Tim pretended to type furiously. Marcus felt
    it—a crack in the facade, the fog rising, threatening to spill. His throat tightened,
    vision blurring at the edges; for a split second, he almost let it out, the weight
    of those unlived laughs, the nights staring at blank pages, wondering if any of
    it mattered. His hands shook visibly now, dropping the marker.


    Then he covered, flashing that trademark grin, though his voice wavered. "Ooh,
    feisty. Setup: Burned-out writer gets called out by newbie. Punch: ''What happened?
    I grew up and realized comedy''s just tragedy plus time—minus the residuals.''
    Tag: Welcome to the room, Eliza. Try not to trip over my crushed dreams on your
    way to the whiteboard."


    Laughter rippled again, but thinner, forced. Eliza didn''t buy it; her eyes said
    she saw through the deflection, straight to the hollow core, mirroring her own
    scars. Marcus turned back to the board, scribbling a new joke structure: "Expectation:
    Cynic wins. Subversion: Maybe not."
