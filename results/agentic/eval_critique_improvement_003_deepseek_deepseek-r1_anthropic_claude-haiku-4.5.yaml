  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.65): The revisions show minimal textual changes
    across versions 0-3, suggesting limited responsiveness to specific critique feedback.
    All three critiques scored youth_voice at 0.76-0.78, yet no demonstrable improvements
    appear in subsequent versions. The opening remains identical across all iterations.
    This indicates either: (a) the author accepted the 0.76-0.78 range as adequate,
    or (b) revisions occurred in unseen sections. The final output does address youth_voice
    concerns through preserved strengths (tongue-poking detail, impulsive action,
    punchy dialogue) but doesn''t show *new* improvements responding to critique weaknesses.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.55): Trajectory is flat rather than ascending. Critiques
    1-3 are nearly identical in structure and scoring, suggesting either: (a) no meaningful
    revisions occurred between them, or (b) revisions were minimal. The final output
    matches the opening of all prior versions verbatim. Without visible progression
    in critique scores or textual evolution, improvement trajectory is weak. However,
    the final output IS strong, suggesting the author may have revised sections not
    shown in the version samples.


    PRESERVATION (0.78): Strengths are well-preserved: the tongue-poking detail, Zara''s
    impulsive emotional honesty (slamming the drive), age-appropriate wit (''Nope.
    But it floats''), and vivid sensory details (rust-water, green-black waves, bruised-fruit
    chop). The worldbuilding remains consistent and immersive. No strengths appear
    sacrificed.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.92, 5/5):

    1. ✓ COMPETENCE WITHOUT UNREALISM: Zara is skilled (mapped currents, built purifier)
    but age-appropriately limited (trembling hands, panic, needs Finn''s expertise).
    She contributes tactically (salvage hook maneuver) but doesn''t solve the core
    problem alone.

    2. ✓ ADULT DISMISSAL: Finn explicitly dismisses her (''Got real work, kid'' /
    ''Adults don''t chase fairy tales''). Mom also dismisses her hope as impractical.

    3. ✓ FLAWED MENTOR: Finn is paralyzed by trauma (lost daughter in storm, lost
    leg). His flaw is emotional avoidance masquerading as pragmatism. He''s competent
    but broken.

    4. ✓ ZARA''S INVENTION: The salvage-built water purifier demonstrates ingenuity.
    It''s functional (pulls salt and microplastics) and character-defining.

    5. ✓ REAL DANGER: The crossing involves genuine peril—collapsing skyscraper debris,
    cracked viewport, seawater intrusion, jagged rebar, shifting currents. Not token
    obstacles; Zara experiences visceral fear (''panic clawing her throat''). The
    *Cormorant* nearly fails.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.85): Hero''s Journey beats are present and well-executed:

    - Ordinary World: Zara''s home, her invention, mother''s dismissal ✓

    - Call to Adventure: Archive pod discovery with map ✓

    - Refusal/Meeting Mentor: Finn''s dismissal, emotional resistance ✓

    - Crossing Threshold: *Cormorant* departure into danger ✓

    - Tests/Trials: Debris collision, viewport crack, bailing water ✓

    - Climactic moment: Zara''s tactical insight (hook/wave maneuver) ✓

    - Return threshold: Plunging into library ✓

    Minor gap: The ''Ordeal'' and ''Reward'' beats are compressed into the crossing
    sequence rather than fully separated, but this works for the excerpt''s scope.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.82): Strengths include vivid sensory language (''green-black
    waves,'' ''bruised fruit,'' ''rebar teeth''), authentic character voice, high
    stakes, and emotional resonance (Finn''s trauma, Zara''s determination). The dialogue
    is sharp and reveals character. Pacing accelerates effectively from ordinary world
    to threshold crossing. Weaknesses: The mentor''s capitulation happens quickly
    (one emotional trigger—the photo—and he agrees). The library entrance feels slightly
    rushed; more tension could build before the final plunge. The worldbuilding is
    strong but could use one more concrete detail about how society functions post-flood
    (governance, resource scarcity mechanisms).


    OVERALL ASSESSMENT: This is a strong piece that satisfies all constraints and
    executes the Hero''s Journey competently. The primary weakness is the revision
    process itself—minimal visible improvement across critique rounds suggests either
    the author plateaued early or revisions occurred in unseen sections. The final
    output quality (0.82) exceeds what the flat improvement trajectory would predict,
    indicating either: (a) the author made substantial revisions not reflected in
    the version samples, or (b) the piece was strong from the start and critiques
    validated rather than transformed it. For agentic task evaluation, this represents
    solid execution with room for deeper responsiveness to critique feedback.'
