  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions. Version 0 was a rough
    start, mostly exposition. Version 1 introduced the core conflict more directly.
    Version 3 (the final output) fully developed the narrative arc, incorporating
    all the requested elements and refining the prose. The final output successfully
    addressed the constraints, particularly showing Mateo's internal conflict, the
    specific moment with his grandmother, and the authentic cultural elements. The
    resolution felt earned. The only minor gap is that the 'one adult' understanding
    Mateo's dilemma (Mrs. Ruiz) felt a little underdeveloped compared to the other
    elements, though her role was present and helpful.
