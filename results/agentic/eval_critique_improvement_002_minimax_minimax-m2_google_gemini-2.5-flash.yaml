  evidence: The revisions, particularly from V0 to the final output, show a significant
    improvement in addressing the emotional complexity and character depth. The initial
    versions were very similar, but the final output successfully integrated the 'almost
    breaks' moment and the theme statement by a minor character. The critiques highlighted
    the 'He laughed, but it wasn't the laugh you do when you're making a joke. It
    was the laugh you do when you're trying not to cry. He covered it with a joke
    anyway.' line, which was preserved and expanded upon to show Marcus's internal
    struggle more effectively. The final version also clearly establishes Riley's
    non-naivete and Sal's role in stating the theme. The story's quality demonstrably
    improved by weaving in the emotional beats more organically and satisfying all
    constraints.
