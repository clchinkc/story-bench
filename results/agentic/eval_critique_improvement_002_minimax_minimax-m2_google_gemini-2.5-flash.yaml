  evidence: The initial critiques highlighted a lack of genuine humor before the pathos,
    and an abrupt transition. The revisions successfully addressed this by introducing
    a more developed joke setup ('Breakfast' dog) and allowing Luis's genuine laugh
    to precede Marcus's 'therapy dog' joke, which then reveals his sadness. The 'almost
    breaks' moment is well-executed with the marker slipping and his voice almost
    breaking. The new writer, Maya, clearly sees through Marcus from her first lines,
    and the theme is stated by her. The story maintains its initial strengths of a
    vivid writers' room atmosphere and strong character voices while deepening the
    emotional complexity. The progression from 'telling' Marcus is hollow to 'showing'
    it through his jokes and Maya's insight is a significant improvement.
