  evidence: The model discovered 3 out of 5 constraints. The questions were generally
    good, but missed key areas like the mother's illness and the bookshop's foreclosure.
    The output incorporated the discovered constraints well, particularly the protagonist's
    past relationship and the former fiance's continued presence in town (though the
    'NO' answer to Q4 was misinterpreted or ignored, as Marcus is still in town).
    The narrative quality is strong, with good pacing and emotional depth.
