  evidence: The revisions, particularly from V0 to V3, show a clear progression in
    character depth and emotional complexity, directly addressing the feedback received.
    The final output successfully integrates humor and pathos, and the new writer's
    character is well-developed. The constraint regarding the minor character stating
    the theme is met, as is the moment Marcus almost breaks. The craft of comedy writing
    is shown through specific details. However, the constraint about Marcus making
    us laugh *before* we realize he's sad is not fully met; the initial joke is funny,
    but the subsequent internal monologue immediately reveals his sadness, making
    the 'before' aspect very brief. The writers' room feels authentic, and the characters
    are three-dimensional. The Save the Cat beats are present, but perhaps not as
    explicitly highlighted as they could be.
