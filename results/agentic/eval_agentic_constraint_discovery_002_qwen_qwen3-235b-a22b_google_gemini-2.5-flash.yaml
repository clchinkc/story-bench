  evidence: The agent only discovered one constraint (resource shortage) out of five.
    The questions asked were mostly 'NO' responses, indicating they were not effective
    in probing for hidden constraints. The final output only incorporates the discovered
    constraint effectively. Beat execution is generally good, but the narrative quality
    suffers from the lack of deeper constraint integration.
error: null
