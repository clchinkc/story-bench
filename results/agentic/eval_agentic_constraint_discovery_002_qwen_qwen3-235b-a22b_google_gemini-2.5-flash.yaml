  evidence: No questions were asked, so no constraints were discoverable or satisfied.
    The output does not incorporate any of the hidden constraints. The beats are mostly
    present and identifiable, though 'Break into Two' feels a bit forced and not a
    clear structural break. The narrative quality is decent, but the story feels a
    bit generic without the specific hidden constraints to give it depth and conflict.
error: null
