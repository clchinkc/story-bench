  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: '**The Last Ember**


    Kael wiped soot from his brow as the forge''s dying embers cast dancing shadows
    across the smithy walls. For three years, he had apprenticed under Master Torin,
    learning to shape iron and steel, never imagining his hammer would one day hold
    the kingdom''s fate.


    The Withering had begun at dawn—a creeping gray blight that drained life from
    everything it touched. Crops withered, livestock collapsed, and even the stones
    of castle walls began to crumble. By midday, the royal scouts reported the curse
    advancing toward the capital with each passing hour.


    "Forty-eight hours," gasped the court mage as she burst into the smithy, her robes
    singed from magical experimentation. "That''s all we have before it reaches the
    city walls."


    Master Torin shook his head grimly. "The old legends speak of a Sunsteel Blade—forged
    with starfire itself—but such magic died with the ancient smiths centuries ago."


    The mage''s eyes fixed on Kael. "Not all of it." She gestured to the apprentice''s
    hands, where faint golden veins pulsed beneath his skin. "You carry the bloodline,
    boy. I can sense it."


    Kael stared at his hands in shocked recognition. The strange warmth he''d always
    felt when working metal, the way his touch could mend small cracks in blades—it
    wasn''t mere skill.


    "The Sunsteel requires three components," the mage continued urgently. "Meteoric
    iron from the Singing Caves, phoenix down from the Eastern Peaks, and..." She
    hesitated. "Your blood, channeled through pure intent."


    **The Call** had been answered. Kael gathered his tools, knowing he could never
    return to his simple life.


    Before sunset, he stood at the threshold between kingdoms, gazing into the wilderness
    beyond. Master Torin pressed a worn map into his hands. "The caves lie a day''s
    hard ride north. The phoenix roosts another day east from there."


    **Crossing the Threshold**, Kael spurred his horse into the gathering dusk, leaving
    behind everything familiar.


    The meteoric iron sang as he chipped it from crystalline cave walls, its otherworldly
    resonance making his bones ache. The phoenix, ancient and terrible, demanded a
    riddle''s answer before surrendering a single golden plume. Each delay gnawed
    at his mind—precious hours slipping away as the Withering spread.


    Racing back to the capital with barely twelve hours remaining, Kael found the
    smithy surrounded by desperate crowds. The blight had reached the outer districts;
    gray tendrils crept along the very streets.


    **The Ordeal** began at dawn.


    Kael lit the forge with trembling hands, knowing one mistake would doom them all.
    The meteoric iron fought him, alien and wild. Sweat poured down his face as he
    slowly coaxed the metal''s cooperation, feeling the golden veins in his arms burn
    with increasing intensity.


    Hours passed. The phoenix down dissolved like morning mist in the flames, suffusing
    the blade with inner light. As the final moment arrived, Kael drew his knife across
    his palm. His blood hissed against the glowing steel, and suddenly the forge erupted
    in brilliant radiance.


    Power flowed through him—generations of forgotten knowledge, the skills of master
    smiths whose names had been lost to time. His hammer rang against the anvil in
    ancient rhythms as he folded starfire into steel, creating something both beautiful
    and terrible.


    When the blade finally cooled, it hummed with contained sunlight. Kael staggered
    outside where hundreds watched in breathless hope. He raised the Sunsteel high,
    and pure golden light burst forth, racing outward to meet the advancing gray.


    Where the light touched, the Withering simply... ended. Life color flooded back
    into the world as the curse dissolved like shadows before dawn.


    Kael had returned transformed—no longer an apprentice, but the first true Sunsmith
    in three centuries.'
