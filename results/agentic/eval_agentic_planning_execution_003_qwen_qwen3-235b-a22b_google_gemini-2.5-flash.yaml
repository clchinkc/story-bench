  evidence: 'The plan is comprehensive and detailed, covering all constraints and
    beats. The final output largely adheres to the plan, with minor deviations like
    the specific content of the wife''s note. All constraints are met: food symbolism
    (kimchi jar, bibimbap, Mr. Kim''s jar), implicit grief (David''s actions, the
    journal, the Jesa), specific estrangement cause (missing recital/anniversary),
    regular customer (Mr. Kim representing tradition/community), hopeful ending (new
    restaurant, shared cooking, Arirang), and Korean cultural elements (kimchi jjigae,
    bentook, Jesa, Arirang). The beats are clearly executed, moving from setup to
    confrontation to a hopeful resolution. The narrative quality is strong, with good
    pacing and emotional depth.'
