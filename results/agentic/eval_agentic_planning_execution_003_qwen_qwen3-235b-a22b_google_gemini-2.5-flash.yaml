  evidence: 'The plan was mostly complete and specific, though it didn''t explicitly
    detail the cause of the daughter''s estrangement beyond ''disagreement over the
    restaurant''s future.'' The final output adhered well to the plan, with minor
    deviations that improved the story. All constraints were met: food used symbolically
    multiple times (japchae/soondubu as memory, miyeokguk as ritual/grief, songpyeon
    as warmth/survival, kimchi as future), David''s grief is palpable without being
    stated (trembling hands, sterile whine, burying mom here), daughter''s estrangement
    is due to David''s emotional stagnation after his wife''s death, Mr. Cho is the
    regular customer representing ritual/grief/connection to the past, the ending
    is hopeful but not unrealistically happy (food truck/pop-up, not saving the restaurant),
    and Korean cultural elements beyond food include the hangari, red envelope, and
    specific food items like songpyeon and kimchi. The beats were clearly executed.
    Narrative quality was good, with strong emotional resonance and character development,
    though some dialogue felt a little on-the-nose.'
