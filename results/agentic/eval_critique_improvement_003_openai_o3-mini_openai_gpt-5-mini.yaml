  evidence: 'Across the three revision rounds the author responded primarily to critique
    about Zara''s voice and to missing concrete details. Version 0 used a more omniscient,
    slightly adult narrator; Versions 1–3 shift to immediate first‑person present,
    adding many childlike phrasings (‘No way,’ ‘I grinned…’) and trimming some of
    the more reflective, adult-sounding sentences. The Salvage Seeker invention is
    introduced and kept, and the mentor’s specific flaw (a past failed mission that
    makes her risk‑averse) was added and made explicit. The adult dismissal by Mr.
    Delgado appears early and unambiguous. The crossing was expanded into a genuinely
    hazardous shipping‑yard sequence (groaning beams, slippery boards, falling debris,
    incoming storm) so the danger reads as real rather than token. Strengths—clear
    stakes, brisk pacing, and a hopeful-but-not‑saccharine tone—were preserved. Remaining
    weaknesses: a few lines retain slightly mature phrasing and occasional reflective
    sentences that read older than 12, so the youth voice is improved but not perfectly
    consistent. Overall the revisions materially improved authenticity, specificity,
    and peril while keeping prior strengths intact.'
