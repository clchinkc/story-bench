  evidence: 'Version 0 is a fragment establishing Elena''s competence but stops mid-action.
    Version 1 preserves the opening but tightens language and pacing. Versions 2–3
    incrementally clarify logistics (calls, overflow pod) and add specificity. The
    final version expands into a complete scene: Mina is introduced as a believable
    counterpoint, the bay-six emergency demonstrates Elena''s competence (direction
    to use bay six, negative-pressure rationale), and her flaw—emotional isolation
    and carrying responsibility alone—is revealed gradually (the defensive comment,
    refusal to let others in, phone facedown). Medical details accumulate usefully
    (saturation 88%, negative-pressure room, high-flow, non‑rebreather, ABG, nebulized
    albuterol) and drive choices. The friendship arc is earned by shared crisis, practical
    help, and a small, honest exchange over coffee. Transformation is internal and
    subtle—Elena agrees to meet again and hesitates before flipping her phone—ending
    with ambiguity about lasting change. Overall the story improves from an incomplete
    sketch to a polished, constraint-satisfying scene with only minor opportunities
    for tighter emotional beats.'
