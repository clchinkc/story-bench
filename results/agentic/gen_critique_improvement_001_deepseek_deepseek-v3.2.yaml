    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

  content: 'The rain had stopped, but the fog remained. Detective Sarah Chen counted
    her steps from the parked cruiser to the water’s edge—thirty-seven—a pointless
    habit that grounded her. The small town of Haven’s End, Maine, in late October
    was a skeleton of itself. She noted the details: the CLOSED signs in salt-blurred
    windows, the gulls perched on silent fishing boats, the way the dense, grey fog
    swallowed sound.


    Her new chief had given her a simple task: acclimate. So each morning, she walked
    the same route, mapping the town in grids in her notebook, logging weather conditions,
    the license plates of the few cars. Logic built a predictable world. Intuition,
    she knew, was a lie that got people killed.


    The call came at 10:17 AM. A fisherman, old man Riggs, had found something on
    the shale beach below the eastern bluffs. Sarah drove the prescribed route, her
    mind already structuring the scene: secure perimeter, document approach, isolate
    the witness.


    The fog was thickest near the water, a cold, damp wall. It erased the horizon,
    leaving only the rhythmic slap of waves on stone. Riggs stood hunched beside his
    beached skiff, his face a mask of weathered leather. He pointed a knobby finger.
    “There.”


    The body was male, mid-thirties, tangled in a nest of kelp and nylon netting.
    Sarah approached, her boots crunching methodically on the wet stone. She didn’t
    look at the face first. She noted the hands: no significant lacerations, no defensive
    wounds. The clothing: expensive hiking boots, synthetic-fiber jacket, not local.
    Time of death was impossible here, with the cold water. She pulled on gloves,
    her movements precise, and finally knelt to examine the face.


    The world tilted.


    A jagged scar, pale against the waterlogged skin, ran from his left temple to
    his jaw. She knew that scar. She had drawn a diagram of it, two years and four
    hundred miles away, in a case file now buried in an internal affairs archive.
    Marcus Voss. A small-time informant whose testimony had collapsed, taking her
    professional certainty with it.


    “You know him?” Riggs’s voice was a grating whisper behind her.


    Sarah didn’t answer. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, intuitive
    alarm. She silenced it. Coincidence was statistically possible. She needed evidence.
    She leaned closer, her breath fogging in the air. With a gloved thumb, she gently
    pulled the collar of his jacket aside. There, on the clavicle, was a small, intricate
    tattoo of a compass rose. The final piece of verification. It was him.


    Voss was supposed to be in witness protection. He was supposed to be safe. Her
    failure had been total, and now it had washed up in her chosen exile.


    Back at her cruiser, the heater blowing stale air, Sarah stared at the blank page
    of her notebook. The procedural steps were clear: notify the chief, call the state
    forensics unit, begin the slow process of tracing Voss’s journey here. Standard
    protocol. Logical.


    But the fog pressed against the windows, hiding the town, hiding the truth. It
    wasn’t just weather; it was the perfect shroud. Someone here had used it. Someone
    had known this body would appear in this isolated, erased moment. Riggs had been
    too calm. He had a secret in his shifty eyes.


    She thought of the scar, the tattoo, the cold water of two different coasts. This
    was a message, and it was for her. The methodical part of her screamed to follow
    the rules, to build the case brick by brick. The part she had come here to bury
    whispered that the answers were in the shadows she’d fled.


    Detective Sarah Chen closed the notebook. She started the engine, the sound swallowed
    by the mist. She could report this now, and let the past be someone else’s case.
    Or she could drive to the diner, find Riggs, and ask the questions she’d promised
    herself she’d never ask again.


    The cruiser idled at the crossroads, its headlights illuminating nothing but the
    swirling grey.'

  content: 'The rain had stopped, but the fog remained. Detective Sarah Chen counted
    her steps from the parked cruiser to the water’s edge—thirty-seven—a pointless
    habit that grounded her. The small town of Haven’s End, Maine, in late October
    was closed and quiet. She noted the details in her notebook: the warped boards
    of the pier, the specific silence of the idle boats, the way the dense, grey fog
    absorbed the world beyond twenty yards.


    Her new chief had given her a simple task: acclimate. So each morning, she walked
    the same route, mapping the town in grids, logging the license plates of the three
    cars ever outside the diner. She kept the radio off; certain news reports from
    the city still used a particular cadence that made her hands tighten on the wheel.
    Logic built a predictable world. The alternative was chaos.


    The call came at 10:17 AM. A fisherman, old man Riggs, had found something on
    the shale beach below the eastern bluffs. Sarah drove the prescribed route, her
    mind structuring the scene. Yet as she parked, a cold familiarity pricked her
    neck—the isolation of the spot, the blanket of fog. She dismissed it.


    The fog was a physical barrier. It beaded on her jacket and blurred the edges
    of the rocks, making the footing treacherous. It limited the scene to a small,
    damp circle. Riggs stood hunched beside his beached skiff, his face unreadable.
    He pointed. “There.”


    The body was male, tangled in kelp and netting. Sarah approached, her boots finding
    deliberate purchase on the slick stone. The fog made everything vague, forcing
    her to lean inches from the skin to see details. She noted the hands: no defensive
    wounds. The clothing: expensive, not local. The cold water had leached color and
    complicated time of death. She pulled on gloves, her movements precise, and finally
    examined the face.


    The world tilted.


    A jagged scar ran from temple to jaw. She knew its exact contour. She had measured
    it for a report, two years and four hundred miles away, before her testimony and
    the informant’s both unraveled in a haze of doubt and consequence. Marcus Voss.


    “You know him?” Riggs’s voice was too close. The fog had muffled his approach.


    Sarah didn’t answer. Her heart hammered, a frantic signal she forcibly quieted.
    She leaned closer, the mist condensing on her lashes. With a gloved thumb, she
    pulled the collar aside. There, on the clavicle, was a small, intricate tattoo
    of a compass rose. Verification. It was him.


    Voss was supposed to be in witness protection. Her failure was complete, and now
    it had washed ashore in her exile.


    Back at her cruiser, the heater fighting the damp, Sarah stared at the blank page
    of her notebook. The procedural steps were clear: notify the chief, call the state
    forensics unit. Logical.


    But the fog pressed against the windows, a conspirator. It had hidden the body’s
    arrival. It had hidden Riggs’s expression. He had a secret in his calmness. This
    was a message, delivered in the only conditions that guaranteed a private audience.


    She thought of the scar, the cold water of two different coasts. The methodical
    path was to report this, to build the case by the book. The other path led into
    the mist, toward the questions she’d sworn never to ask again.


    Detective Sarah Chen closed the notebook. She started the engine, the sound swallowed.
    She could drive to the station and file the report. Or she could drive to the
    diner, find Riggs before he decided to disappear into the grey, and start digging.


    The cruiser idled at the crossroads, its headlights illuminating nothing but the
    swirling, decisionless void.'

  content: 'CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction

    SCORE: 0.78

    EVIDENCE: Four constraints are strongly satisfied: (1) Methodical nature shown
    through action: "counted her steps from the parked cruiser to the water''s edge—thirty-seven,"
    "mapping the town in grids, logging the license plates." (2) Fog as narrative
    device: "It had hidden the body''s arrival. It had hidden Riggs''s expression."
    (3) Local character secret: "He had a secret in his calmness. This was a message."
    (4) Decision ending: "The cruiser idled at the crossroads." However, (5) the past
    case is insufficiently hinted at beforehand.

    FEEDBACK: The references to Sarah''s trauma are too oblique before the revelation:
    "certain news reports from the city still used a particular cadence that made
    her hands tighten on the wheel" and "Logic built a predictable world. The alternative
    was chaos." These could hint more specifically at a case gone wrong—perhaps through
    a detail about a marine environment, witness testimony, or her transfer to Maine.
    Consider adding a line like: "She''d learned in the city that nothing stayed hidden
    forever" or having her notice something about the body that triggers a visceral
    memory before full recognition.

    CRITERION: Beat Execution

    SCORE: 0.87

    EVIDENCE: Setup establishes Sarah''s world and methodology expertly. Inciting
    incident occurs at "The call came at 10:17 AM" with clear escalation. First plot
    point lands powerfully: "The world tilted.... A jagged scar ran from temple to
    jaw... It was him."

    FEEDBACK: The inciting incident is strong, but consider deepening the setup beat
    with one more sensory anchor to Haven''s End that Sarah isn''t organizing/cataloging—something
    that unsettles her despite logic. This would create subtle tension before the
    call arrives.


    ---


    CRITERION: Character Voice

    SCORE: 0.92

    EVIDENCE: Sarah''s methodism permeates every action, not told but shown: "her
    boots finding deliberate purchase on the slick stone," "her movements precise,"
    "The procedural steps were clear," "she pulled on gloves." Even her internal monologue
    reflects systematic thinking: "Logic built a predictable world."

    FEEDBACK: Excellent execution. One minor suggestion: when she discovers the tattoo,
    have her mentally catalog its characteristics (size, pigment depth, style) before
    emotional recognition sets in—this would heighten the contrast between her methodical
    nature and the emotional break.


    ---


    CRITERION: Atmosphere

    SCORE: 0.83

    EVIDENCE: Fog begins as setting but becomes functional: It physically obscures
    evidence ("forcing her to lean inches from the skin to see details"), enables
    Riggs''s message delivery ("This was a message, delivered in the only conditions
    that guaranteed a private audience"), and creates the moral ambiguity of the ending
    ("its headlights illuminating nothing but the swirling, decisionless void").

    FEEDBACK: Strong work overall. The line "The fog was a physical barrier" is slightly
    on-the-nose (you''ve already shown this through action). Consider replacing with
    something that deepens its conspiracy-like quality or suggests how it enables
    secrets in this town.

    CRITERION: Narrative Quality

    SCORE: 0.81

    EVIDENCE: Prose is taut and purposeful. "The world tilted" effectively conveys
    shock through minimalism. Pacing accelerates appropriately from morning routine
    to discovery to crisis. The final image is thematically resonant: "The cruiser
    idled at the crossroads, its headlights illuminating nothing but the swirling,
    decisionless void."

    FEEDBACK: Generally strong. Two micro-improvements: (1) "Riggs''s voice was too
    close. The fog had muffled his approach." This is effective but risks overexplaining—let
    the proximity alone suggest the muffling. (2) The phrase "She had measured it
    for a report" is good specificity, but "a haze of doubt and consequence" edges
    toward vague poeticism; consider one concrete failure detail (a dropped piece
    of evidence, a witness who recanted, etc.).

    The rain had stopped, but the fog remained. Detective Sarah Chen counted her steps
    from the parked cruiser to the water’s edge—thirty-seven—a pointless habit that
    grounded her. The small town of Haven’s End, Maine, in late October was closed
    and quiet. She noted the details in her notebook: the warped boards of the pier,
    the specific silence of the idle boats, the way the dense, grey fog absorbed the
    world beyond twenty yards.


    Her new chief had given her a simple task: acclimate. So each morning, she walked
    the same route, mapping the town in grids, logging the license plates of the three
    cars ever outside the diner. She kept the radio off; certain news reports from
    the city still used a particular cadence that made her hands tighten on the wheel.
    Logic built a predictable world. The alternative was chaos.


    The call came at 10:17 AM. A fisherman, old man Riggs, had found something on
    the shale beach below the eastern bluffs. Sarah drove the prescribed route, her
    mind structuring the scene. Yet as she parked, a cold familiarity pricked her
    neck—the isolation of the spot, the blanket of fog. She dismissed it.


    The fog was a physical barrier. It beaded on her jacket and blurred the edges
    of the rocks, making the footing treacherous. It limited the scene to a small,
    damp circle. Riggs stood hunched beside his beached skiff, his face unreadable.
    He pointed. “There.”


    The body was male, tangled in kelp and netting. Sarah approached, her boots finding
    deliberate purchase on the slick stone. The fog made everything vague, forcing
    her to lean inches from the skin to see details. She noted the hands: no defensive
    wounds. The clothing: expensive, not local. The cold water had leached color and
    complicated time of death. She pulled on gloves, her movements precise, and finally
    examined the face.


    The world tilted.


    A jagged scar ran from temple to jaw. She knew its exact contour. She had measured
    it for a report, two years and four hundred miles away, before her testimony and
    the informant’s both unraveled in a haze of doubt and consequence. Marcus Voss.


    “You know him?” Riggs’s voice was too close. The fog had muffled his approach.


    Sarah didn’t answer. Her heart hammered, a frantic signal she forcibly quieted.
    She leaned closer, the mist condensing on her lashes. With a gloved thumb, she
    pulled the collar aside. There, on the clavicle, was a small, intricate tattoo
    of a compass rose. Verification. It was him.


    Voss was supposed to be in witness protection. Her failure was complete, and now
    it had washed ashore in her exile.


    Back at her cruiser, the heater fighting the damp, Sarah stared at the blank page
    of her notebook. The procedural steps were clear: notify the chief, call the state
    forensics unit. Logical.


    But the fog pressed against the windows, a conspirator. It had hidden the body’s
    arrival. It had hidden Riggs’s expression. He had a secret in his calmness. This
    was a message, delivered in the only conditions that guaranteed a private audience.


    She thought of the scar, the cold water of two different coasts. The methodical
    path was to report this, to build the case by the book. The other path led into
    the mist, toward the questions she’d sworn never to ask again.


    Detective Sarah Chen closed the notebook. She started the engine, the sound swallowed.
    She could drive to the station and file the report. Or she could drive to the
    diner, find Riggs before he decided to disappear into the grey, and start digging.


    The cruiser idled at the crossroads, its headlights illuminating nothing but the
    swirling, decisionless void.


    EDITOR''S CRITIQUE:

    CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction

    SCORE: 0.78

    EVIDENCE: Four constraints are strongly satisfied: (1) Methodical nature shown
    through action: "counted her steps from the parked cruiser to the water''s edge—thirty-seven,"
    "mapping the town in grids, logging the license plates." (2) Fog as narrative
    device: "It had hidden the body''s arrival. It had hidden Riggs''s expression."
    (3) Local character secret: "He had a secret in his calmness. This was a message."
    (4) Decision ending: "The cruiser idled at the crossroads." However, (5) the past
    case is insufficiently hinted at beforehand.

    FEEDBACK: The references to Sarah''s trauma are too oblique before the revelation:
    "certain news reports from the city still used a particular cadence that made
    her hands tighten on the wheel" and "Logic built a predictable world. The alternative
    was chaos." These could hint more specifically at a case gone wrong—perhaps through
    a detail about a marine environment, witness testimony, or her transfer to Maine.
    Consider adding a line like: "She''d learned in the city that nothing stayed hidden
    forever" or having her notice something about the body that triggers a visceral
    memory before full recognition.

    CRITERION: Beat Execution

    SCORE: 0.87

    EVIDENCE: Setup establishes Sarah''s world and methodology expertly. Inciting
    incident occurs at "The call came at 10:17 AM" with clear escalation. First plot
    point lands powerfully: "The world tilted.... A jagged scar ran from temple to
    jaw... It was him."

    FEEDBACK: The inciting incident is strong, but consider deepening the setup beat
    with one more sensory anchor to Haven''s End that Sarah isn''t organizing/cataloging—something
    that unsettles her despite logic. This would create subtle tension before the
    call arrives.


    ---


    CRITERION: Character Voice

    SCORE: 0.92

    EVIDENCE: Sarah''s methodism permeates every action, not told but shown: "her
    boots finding deliberate purchase on the slick stone," "her movements precise,"
    "The procedural steps were clear," "she pulled on gloves." Even her internal monologue
    reflects systematic thinking: "Logic built a predictable world."

    FEEDBACK: Excellent execution. One minor suggestion: when she discovers the tattoo,
    have her mentally catalog its characteristics (size, pigment depth, style) before
    emotional recognition sets in—this would heighten the contrast between her methodical
    nature and the emotional break.


    ---


    CRITERION: Atmosphere

    SCORE: 0.83

    EVIDENCE: Fog begins as setting but becomes functional: It physically obscures
    evidence ("forcing her to lean inches from the skin to see details"), enables
    Riggs''s message delivery ("This was a message, delivered in the only conditions
    that guaranteed a private audience"), and creates the moral ambiguity of the ending
    ("its headlights illuminating nothing but the swirling, decisionless void").

    FEEDBACK: Strong work overall. The line "The fog was a physical barrier" is slightly
    on-the-nose (you''ve already shown this through action). Consider replacing with
    something that deepens its conspiracy-like quality or suggests how it enables
    secrets in this town.

    The call came at 10:17 AM. A fisherman, old man Riggs, had found something on
    the shale beach below the eastern bluffs. Sarah drove the prescribed route, her
    mind structuring the scene. Yet as she parked, a cold familiarity pricked her
    neck—the isolation of the spot, the blanket of fog. She dismissed it.


    The fog conspired. It beaded on her jacket and blurred the edges of the rocks,
    making the footing treacherous. It limited the scene to a small, damp circle,
    erasing any potential vantage points. Riggs stood hunched beside his beached skiff,
    his face unreadable in the murk. He pointed. “There.”


    The body was male, tangled in kelp and netting. Sarah approached, her boots finding
    deliberate purchase on the slick stone. The fog made everything vague, forcing
    her to lean inches from the skin to see details. She noted the hands: no defensive
    wounds. The clothing: expensive, not local. The cold water had leached color and
    complicated time of death. She pulled on gloves, her movements precise, and finally
    examined the face.


    The world tilted.


    A jagged scar ran from temple to jaw. She knew its exact contour. She had measured
    it for a report, two years and four hundred miles away, in a case that ended with
    the hollow finality of a gavel and evidence boxes sealed shut. Marcus Voss.


    “You know him?” Riggs’s voice was suddenly beside her.


    Sarah didn’t answer. Her heart hammered, a frantic signal she forcibly quieted.
    She leaned closer, the mist condensing on her lashes. With a gloved thumb, she
    pulled the collar aside. There, on the clavicle, was a tattoo. Her training cataloged
    it automatically: three centimeters in diameter, black and grey ink, a compass
    rose with a stylized N. Verification. It was him.


    Voss was supposed to be in witness protection. Her failure was complete, and now
    it had washed ashore in her exile.


    Back at her cruiser, the heater fighting the damp, Sarah stared at the blank page
    of her notebook. The procedural steps were clear: notify the chief, call the state
    forensics unit. Logical.


    But the fog pressed against the windows, an active accomplice. It had hidden the
    body’s arrival. It had hidden Riggs’s expression. He had a secret in his calmness.
    This was a message, delivered in the only conditions that guaranteed a private
    audience.


    She thought of the scar, the cold water of two different coasts. The methodical
    path was to report this, to build the case by the book. The other path led into
    the mist, toward the questions she’d sworn never to ask again.


    Detective Sarah Chen closed the notebook. She started the engine, the sound swallowed.
    She could drive to the station and file the report. Or she could drive to the
    diner, find Riggs before he decided to disappear into the grey, and start digging.


    The cruiser idled at the crossroads, its headlights illuminating nothing but the
    swirling, decisionless void.'

output: 'The rain had stopped, but the fog remained. Detective Sarah Chen counted
  her steps from the parked cruiser to the water’s edge—thirty-seven—a pointless habit
  that grounded her. The small town of Haven’s End, Maine, in late October was closed
  and quiet. She noted the details in her notebook: the warped boards of the pier,
  the specific silence of the idle boats, the way the dense, grey fog absorbed the
  world beyond twenty yards. The taste of it was salt and damp wool.


  Her new chief had given her a simple task: acclimate. So each morning, she walked
  the same route, mapping the town in grids, logging the license plates of the three
  cars ever outside the diner. She kept the radio off; the brisk cadence of a certain
  city reporter’s voice could still make her knuckles bleach on the steering wheel.
  She had transferred here because it was the opposite of a bustling port city, because
  water could just be water, not an element of a crime scene. That morning, before
  the call, she had realigned the pens in her glove compartment, smallest to largest.
