  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Tightened prose rhythm (''pressed to her chest'' vs ''tucked''),
    removed redundancy (''single continuous exhale'' → ''machine that never powered
    down''), sharpened sensory specificity. VERSION 1→3: Further compression (''took
    it in'' vs ''scanned it once''), elevated diction (''glare'' vs ''lights''), improved
    pacing through fragment syntax. FINAL: Integrated all refinements while adding
    critical narrative depth. CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS: (1) Competence before flaw—SATISFIED:
    Opening 5 paragraphs establish Elena''s clinical mastery, decision-making speed,
    and staff deference before revealing isolation/control issues. (2) Genuine friendship—SATISFIED:
    Mina''s attentiveness (specific questions, no performative praise, action over
    reassurance) and Elena''s reciprocal vulnerability (coffee, badge confession,
    ''meant it'') create earned trust through mutual recognition rather than convenience.
    (3) Internal transformation—SATISFIED: No external change; Elena''s shift is cognitive/emotional
    (''let someone stand with you,'' testing whether ''looking could become a habit'').
    The final ambiguity (''as if testing'') preserves uncertainty about durability.
    (4) Specific medical detail serving story—SATISFIED: ''Aerosol-generating procedures''
    (nebulized albuterol, high-flow oxygen) function as both clinical accuracy and
    metaphor for Elena''s need to control dispersal/exposure. Bay six''s negative-pressure
    room placement becomes both logistical and symbolic. (5) Ending ambiguity—SATISFIED:
    Final image deliberately unresolved—''as if testing whether looking could become
    a habit'' leaves open whether this is genuine change or another performance. The
    facedown phone gesture echoes opening isolation. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening establishes
    competence (✓), reveals flaw through isolation markers (✓), introduces Mina with
    specificity (✓), creates crisis that forces vulnerability (✓), shows internal
    shift through dialogue/action (✓), ends with ambiguous commitment (✓). NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Prose achieves economy without flatness; metaphors (clipboard as shield,
    machine that never powers down) sustain thematic coherence; dialogue reveals character
    through what''s unsaid; pacing mirrors Elena''s own rhythm. Minor gap: Mina''s
    backstory remains deliberately sparse—could risk feeling underdeveloped, though
    this serves the constraint of focusing on Elena''s internal arc.'
