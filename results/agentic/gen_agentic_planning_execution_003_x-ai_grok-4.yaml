    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations

  content: 'Below is the detailed story plan for the requested narrative, structured
    according to the Three-Act Structure theory. The plan is designed to span the
    final week before the restaurant''s demolition, building tension through David''s
    internal and external conflicts. I''ve organized it into the required components:
    a beat-by-beat outline with key events (mapped to the required beats of Setup/Act
    1, Confrontation/Act 2 midpoint, and Resolution/Act 3); character arcs and development
    points; key dialogue moments or revelations; pacing and tension curve; and how
    constraints will be satisfied. This plan ensures a cohesive, emotionally resonant
    story that follows the protagonist''s journey from denial and grief to a bittersweet
    acceptance.


    ### Beat-by-Beat Outline with Key Events

    The outline is divided into the three acts, with specific beats that map to the
    required elements (Setup in Act 1, Confrontation as the Act 2 midpoint, and Resolution
    in Act 3). Each act includes timed events over the final week (e.g., Day 1-2 for
    Act 1, Days 3-5 for Act 2, Days 6-7 for Act 3) to maintain a compressed timeline.
    Key events drive the conflict: David''s decision-making about the restaurant''s
    fate, his confrontation with his daughter Anna, and his unspoken grief.


    #### Act 1: Setup (Days 1-2 – Introduce world, characters, and stakes; end with
    inciting incident)

    - **Beat 1: Ordinary World and Inciting Incident (Day 1 morning)**: David opens
    the restaurant as usual, preparing kimchi jjigae (stew) for the lunch rush. He
    interacts with staff and regulars, showcasing the bustling, nostalgic atmosphere
    of the changing Chicago neighborhood (gentrifying with new condos encroaching).
    The inciting incident hits when a city official delivers the final demolition
    notice— the highway expansion is imminent in one week. David stares at a faded
    photo of his late wife, Ji-yeon, in the kitchen (implicit grief cue), touching
    it briefly before continuing work.

    - **Beat 2: Introduction of Supporting Characters and Initial Conflict (Day 1
    afternoon)**: Introduce Mr. Lee, a 70-year-old regular customer and fellow Korean
    immigrant who has dined there weekly for 25 years; he represents David''s connection
    to his immigrant roots and the enduring community (he shares stories of arriving
    in Chicago like David did). David''s estranged daughter, Anna (28, a graphic designer
    in California), calls unexpectedly after years of distance, urging him to retire
    and move in with her. Flashback subtly reveals estrangement cause: After Ji-yeon''s
    death from illness 10 years ago, David immersed himself in the restaurant, missing
    Anna''s college graduation and prioritizing work over her emotional needs, leading
    to her resentment and move west.

    - **Beat 3: Protagonist''s Initial Resistance (Day 2 evening)**: David hosts a
    small staff dinner, serving bibimbap (mixed rice dish). He debates options aloud—fight
    legally, relocate, or retire—but dismisses them, clinging to the restaurant as
    his "home." End of Act 1: Anna arrives unannounced in Chicago, escalating the
    conflict by demanding he choose retirement and California over fighting a lost
    cause.


    #### Act 2: Confrontation (Days 3-5 – Rising action with obstacles; build to midpoint
    confrontation)

    - **Beat 4: Rising Tension and Obstacles (Day 3)**: David and Anna argue over
    breakfast at the restaurant; she pushes for relocation to California, revealing
    her hurt from his past neglect. David meets with a lawyer about fighting the demolition
    but learns it''s futile (legal fees too high, city backing strong). Mr. Lee visits,
    sharing a story of his own losses, subtly mirroring David''s unspoken grief.

    - **Beat 5: Emotional Deepening and Subplot Development (Day 4)**: David cooks
    galbi (short ribs), a dish Ji-yeon loved, and shares it with Anna during a tense
    family meal—leading to a moment of vulnerability where Anna softens but doesn''t
    forgive. External pressure mounts: Neighborhood protests against the highway fizzle
    out, and a developer offers a low buyout for relocation. David considers retiring
    but feels lost without the restaurant.

    - **Beat 6: Midpoint Confrontation (Day 5 evening – Required Confrontation Beat)**:
    Climax of Act 2: During a busy dinner service, Anna confronts David in the kitchen
    amid the chaos. She accuses him of using the restaurant as a crutch to avoid grieving
    Ji-yeon and building a life with her (the daughter). David snaps, defending his
    choices, but a kitchen mishap (overcooked dish) forces him to admit the restaurant
    is failing. Mr. Lee intervenes, urging reconciliation. This beat shifts the story:
    David agrees to visit a potential relocation site but internally questions everything,
    marking his lowest point.


    #### Act 3: Resolution (Days 6-7'

  content: 'The steam from the pot of kimchi jjigae rose like a veil in the dim morning
    light of Park''s Korean Kitchen, carrying the sharp tang of fermented cabbage
    and gochujang that had perfumed the air for 25 years. David Park, at 50, moved
    with the rote precision of habit, chopping scallions and stirring the stew as
    his small staff trickled in. The neighborhood outside was transforming—cranes
    loomed over new condos, swallowing the old brick facades of Chicago''s West Side.
    This place, with its worn wooden tables and faded murals of Seoul''s skyline,
    was more than a restaurant; it was where he''d built everything.


    A city official interrupted the prep, thrusting a notice into David''s hands:
    demolition in one week for the highway expansion. David''s gaze drifted to the
    photo on the wall—Ji-yeon, smiling in her apron, the one who''d insisted on naming
    the place after their family. He touched the frame''s edge, then turned back to
    the stove, the stew bubbling as if nothing had changed.


    By afternoon, the lunch crowd thinned. Mr. Lee shuffled in, his weekly ritual
    unbroken. The 70-year-old, with his thick accent and tales of fleeing Busan in
    the ''70s, was a fixture, like the brass bells on the door. "Same as always, David-ah,"
    he said, ordering bulgogi. "This place... it''s our little Korea here." David
    nodded, serving the sizzling beef, the meat''s caramelized edges a symbol of resilience
    amid the encroaching change.


    Then the phone rang. Anna''s voice, sharp from California: "Dad, I heard about
    the notice. It''s time to retire. Come live with me." The estrangement hung unspoken—after
    Ji-yeon''s illness claimed her a decade ago, David had buried himself in the restaurant,
    missing Anna''s graduation, her milestones. She''d fled west, resentful of being
    second to steaming pots and late-night shifts.


    That evening, David dismissed it all over a staff dinner of bibimbap, the colorful
    mix of rice, vegetables, and egg a patchwork of what he''d cling to. "Fight? Relocate?
    No, this is home." But as the sun set, Anna appeared at the door, bags in hand,
    her eyes fierce. "You''re choosing this place over us again?"


    The next days blurred into arguments. Over breakfast on Day 3, Anna pushed: "California''s
    a fresh start, Dad. You neglected me after Mom... I won''t let you rot here."
    David met a lawyer, but the fees were impossible, the city''s plans ironclad.
    Mr. Lee dropped by, sipping tea, his story of losing his own shop in the ''80s
    a quiet echo of buried sorrows.


    On Day 4, David grilled galbi, the short ribs Ji-yeon had adored, their smoky
    sweetness filling the air. He served Anna, the meal a fragile bridge. "Remember
    how she''d hum while cooking these?" he said softly. Anna''s eyes glistened, but
    she pulled back. Protests in the neighborhood fizzled; a developer offered peanuts
    for relocation. David stared at the empty dining room, feeling adrift.


    By Day 5''s dinner rush, chaos reigned. Orders piled up, and Anna cornered him
    in the kitchen. "This restaurant is your excuse to hide from Mom''s death, from
    me!" she shouted over clanging pans. David snapped, "It''s all I have left!" But
    an overcooked batch of jjigae scorched, smoke billowing—a metaphor for his crumbling
    world. Mr. Lee, overhearing from his table, intervened: "Family is the real legacy,
    David-ah. Don''t lose her too." Defeated, David agreed to scout a new site, but
    doubt gnawed at him.


    Day 6 brought the relocation visit—a sterile strip mall spot, far from the soul
    of their neighborhood. David cooked mandu dumplings there, folding the wrappers
    like sealing memories, their plump shapes symbolizing the family bonds he''d nearly
    severed. "I stayed because this place kept her close," he admitted to Anna, voice
    cracking without naming the grief. She hugged him, whispering, "I miss her too.
    But we can remember together."


    On demolition eve, Day 7, David hosted a farewell. Staff, neighbors, Mr. Lee gathered.
    He prepared a spread, incorporating a simple jesa rite—offering rice and fruit
    on a small altar to honor ancestors, a Korean tradition beyond the meals, invoking
    Ji-yeon''s spirit without words. Laughter mixed with tears; Anna helped serve,
    her resentment easing into tentative warmth.


    As bulldozers rumbled at dawn, David didn''t fight. He''d retire, move to California
    with Anna, perhaps start pop-up dinners to keep the flavors alive. It wasn''t
    perfect—the restaurant''s loss stung, a chapter closed. But walking away with
    her, a box of photos and recipes in hand, he felt a spark of hope: new highways
    ahead, built on old foundations.'
