  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is exceptionally detailed with specific scenes, dialogue
    beats, and symbolic choices. All three required beats (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution)
    are clearly mapped and executed in the output. Symbolic food usage is strong:
    doenjang-jjigae represents history/roots (Act 2), mookeunji represents grief maturation
    (Act 3). David''s grief is powerfully implicit—the rice bowl ritual, the empty
    stool, the knife-sharpening avoidance. Hannah''s estrangement has a specific,
    believable cause: David''s emotional withdrawal after Mi-Sun''s death left her
    feeling abandoned. Mr. Henderson effectively represents neighborhood history and
    David''s fear of obsolescence. The Soju ritual and bowing provide authentic Korean
    cultural elements beyond food. Ending is hopeful (David will visit in a month,
    moves forward) but realistic (he doesn''t immediately relocate, still processing).
    WEAKNESSES: Output is truncated mid-sentence (''I buried the jar in the back''),
    preventing full evaluation of the final resolution. This is a technical execution
    failure rather than planning failure. The constraint about the ending being ''hopeful
    but not unrealistically happy'' is satisfied in the plan but incompletely demonstrated
    in the truncated output. MINOR: The plan could have been slightly more explicit
    about how the mookeunji metaphor would be fully articulated in dialogue, though
    the setup is clear. Overall, this is strong planning with excellent constraint
    integration and a narrative that balances emotional depth with specificity.'
