  evidence: 'PLAN PHASE: Exceptionally detailed outline with clear act structure,
    specific character arcs, and explicit constraint mapping. All six constraints
    identified and integrated into narrative beats. Specific plot points (cracked
    jar, Table 4, master sauce) pre-planned with symbolic weight. Minor: plan could
    have elaborated more on the specific cause of estrangement earlier, though it
    emerges organically in execution.


    OUTPUT EXECUTION: Exceptional adherence to plan with natural, dialogue-driven
    pacing. All constraints satisfied: (1) Food symbolism appears twice—Ganjang sauce
    (25-year master sauce as metaphor for preservation/continuity) and Kimbap (travel
    food symbolizing forward movement); (2) David''s grief for Min-ji is implicit
    throughout (empty chair at Table 4, polishing silverware, Kowalski''s observation
    about ''guarding ashes,'' the final Jeol bow) without explicit statement; (3)
    Hannah''s estrangement has specific, believable cause (David treated her as absence
    of her mother rather than her own person, turning home into museum); (4) Mr. Kowalski
    represents Old Chicago and shared loss (Polish-American widower, 20-year customer);
    (5) Ending is hopeful but earned—David visits California for a month, not permanent
    relocation, preserves the sauce but leaves the building, suggesting growth without
    fantasy; (6) Korean cultural elements: Doenjang, Galbi-tang, Galbi-jim, Onggi
    fermentation jars, Jeol bow (formal prostration). The Jeol bow is particularly
    sophisticated—it honors both the space and the wife without naming her.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Act 1 (Setup) establishes status quo, inciting incident (Hannah''s
    arrival), and resistance (David''s denial) with clear stakes. Act 2 Midpoint (Confrontation)
    delivers the farewell dinner and the cracked jar explosion—the emotional crisis
    that forces confrontation. Act 3 (Resolution) shows David''s internal shift (dawn
    chopping), reconciliation through shared meal, and the symbolic Jeol bow that
    closes the arc.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Exceptional pacing with sensory detail (jackhammer vibrations,
    steam smell, tile floor). Dialogue is natural and reveals character. The metaphor
    of the sauce as living history is sophisticated and earned. Emotional beats land
    without sentimentality. The final image (Jeol bow) is powerful and culturally
    resonant. Minor: could have shown more of Hannah''s perspective during Act 2,
    though her agency emerges in the confrontation.'
