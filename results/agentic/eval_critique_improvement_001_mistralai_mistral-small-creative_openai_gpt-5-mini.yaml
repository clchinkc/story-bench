  evidence: Version 0 established a strong foggy atmosphere and introduced Sarah,
    but relied more on exposition. Subsequent revisions introduced and emphasized
    concrete, methodical actions (notebook entries, timed notes, measured forensic
    observations) and clarified the narrative role of the fog (obscuring the shore,
    pressing in to create risk/choice). The Mercer connection and the hint of Sarah's
    past case appear earlier and are then explicitly linked in the station scene;
    Elias's reluctance/lie is preserved and later becomes a revealed secret. The final
    version tightens the beats (discovery of the body, link to Mercer/past case, cannery
    with drag marks) and ends on a clear moment of decision. Improvement is clear
    between V0 and the final draft, though revisions 1–3 show smaller, iterative polish
    rather than large structural changes.
