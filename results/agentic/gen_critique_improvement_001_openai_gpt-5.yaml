    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

  content: 'The fog moved like a living thing, a gray tide that swallowed the harbor
    and gave it back in breaths. Sarah Chen stood at the edge of the warped planks,
    counting. Buoy clang: three seconds apart. Gull cry: twice, then silence. She
    wrote the intervals in a damp notebook, the pencil lead smudging, and matched
    them to tide tables clipped beneath. At this hour, low water dragged sluggishly;
    anything tossed in upriver would drift toward the breakwater. She traced the line
    with her gloved finger along the chart, then looked up at the real water, softening
    to pewter beneath the fog.


    “Detective,” said Maeve O’Doul, the harbor master, stepping lightly for someone
    whose boots could anchor a sloop. “You’ve been staring at that same tide graph
    for ten minutes.”


    “Seven,” Sarah said without looking away. “I’m establishing baseline conditions.”


    “You could just ask me,” Maeve said, half a laugh. Behind her, the empty tourist
    shops pressed their faces to the harbor, faded signs promising chowder in warmer
    months.


    Sarah tucked the pencil behind her ear and resumed counting the buoy’s tolling.
    “I will. But the water lies less than people do.”


    Maeve’s smile thinned. “People lie for reasons.”


    The fog slid in again, swallowing the outer docks. Somewhere beyond the breakwater,
    a bell chimed, then another, the sound folding in on itself like an echo trapped
    in cotton. Sarah listened, eyes tracking a ribbon of seaweed braided to a piling,
    the slick fronds indicating direction of flow. She moved along the dock, measuring
    distance by stride, then crouched to examine a footprint drying in the salt air.
    Broad sole, chewed heel. She touched it lightly, gauging the moisture against
    her glove. Not hours old. Minutes. She marked the spot with flagged tape.


    She was thinking of another harbor, another morning, a knot she’d misread because
    she trusted a witness over the wind. She did not let that memory finish.


    “Chen,” Officer Bennett’s voice called from the fog, younger than it should have
    been for a man with a widow’s peak. “We got something by the seawall.”


    Sarah straightened and nodded to Maeve. “Baseline established,” she said, and
    followed the voice.


    The body surfaced where the fog thinned, as if the town had exhaled it. Male,
    mid-thirties, sweatshirt bloated with water. The surf pushed him against the seawall,
    a rhythmic insistence that left dark stains on the stone. Sarah held up a hand;
    Bennett froze on the slick steps. She crouched, extending a hooked pole to snag
    the hoodie without snagging anything else. Her motions were measured, small.


    “Photos first,” she said. Bennett complied, the flash swallowed, strangely private
    in the fog. On the third shot, Sarah leaned in to steady the chin with her fingertips.
    She made a slow inventory: a healed scar above the eye, three small tattoos along
    the wrist—waves, a matchstick, and something like an anchor broken in two. She
    scraped a sample of the grit lining his shoes. River silt? No. Ground shell. Elsewhere.
    The laces were tied with a neat, tight knot that her hands knew before her mind
    admitted it.


    Her stomach tightened, a reflex she cataloged and then set aside. She whispered,
    “Double constrictor,” and reached for her phone. The screen’s cracked corner reflected
    a sliver of her face. A message still sat unread at the top: IA wants final statement—Boston
    PD. She flicked it away and finished bagging the laces.


    “Know him?” Bennett asked.


    “No,” she said. It wasn’t the face; it was the knot. She could feel, in her muscles,
    the cold of another morning, a pier lit by patrol car strobes, a woman’s body
    laid out on the planks with that same knot biting into her wrist. She had insisted
    then that the boyfriend was the type to tie sailors’ knots, but the boyfriend
    had cried like a child and told her he couldn’t even tie a tie. She had been wrong.
    She had told Internal Affairs so, and transferred before the apology could harden
    into policy.


    From the dock above, a shadow resolved into Greg Larkin, owner of the bait shop
    that smelled like old coin and fish blood. “That’s a shame,” he said, voice flat.
    He pulled his cap down low. “Season’s bad enough without bodies scaring off the
    last stragglers.”


    “You see anything?” Sarah asked.


    “Fog,” he said. “Same as you.”


    She noted his boots—dry, though the dock boards were wet where he stood. A piece
    of twine hung from his pocket, stained green. She tucked the detail away, like
    a shell to turn later in the hand.


    “Who handles bait runs at night?” she asked.


    Greg’s jaw worked. “Close up at eight. Nobody’s call to make runs after.”


    Maeve’s throat cleared behind Sarah. “Fewer boats out this time of year,” she
    added, too quick. “Less need.”


    Sarah turned. Maeve’s cuffs were damp halfway to the elbow. She’d said she didn’t
    go out in the fog; it spooked her. Sarah hadn’t asked yet. She met Maeve’s eyes.
    The harbor master looked away, out into the whiteness.


    Bennett said, “We got ID.” He held up a soaked wallet in a gloved hand. The license
    fluttered. The name punched through the fog in Sarah’s head: Aaron Bell. She had
    seen it on a transcript two years back, a dockworker who never showed for a deposition.
    A ghost who had handled stolen phones and vanished after a girl died with a double
    constrictor knot chewing at her wrists.


    Sarah felt the shape of the decision before she stepped into it. The fog pressed
    close, folding sound into secrecy, hiding movement, equal parts blessing and threat.
    The knot tied the harbor to Boston, tied Sarah to the thing she’d fled.


    She thumbed open her phone, staring at IA’s unread message, at Bennett waiting,
    at Maeve’s damp cuffs, at Greg’s dry boots on wet wood.


    “Bag the laces,” she said again, voice steady. “And someone get me a list of every
    boat that left after dark.”


    Her thumb hovered over two numbers: the Boston task force, or no one at all.


    In the muffled harbor, Sarah chose which way to call.'

  content: 'The fog moved like a living thing, a gray tide that swallowed the harbor
    and gave it back in breaths. Sarah Chen stood at the edge of the warped planks,
    counting. Buoy clang: three seconds apart—one, two—


    “Detective,” said Maeve O’Doul, the harbor master, stepping lightly for someone
    whose boots could anchor a sloop. “You’ve been staring at that same tide graph
    for ten minutes.”


    Sarah held her finger on the notebook to mark her place. “Seven,” she said, eyes
    on the water. “I’m establishing baseline conditions.”


    “You could just ask me,” Maeve said, half a laugh. Behind her, empty shops pressed
    their faces to the harbor, faded signs promising chowder in warmer months.


    Buoy clang again. Sarah resumed the count without looking up, pencil hovering,
    then wrote the interval, matched it to tide tables clipped beneath. At this hour,
    low water dragged sluggishly; anything tossed upriver would drift toward the breakwater.
    She traced the expected line with a gloved finger along the chart, then compared
    it to a ribbon of seaweed braided to a piling, slick fronds indicating flow. She
    moved down the dock, measuring distance by stride, then crouched by a footprint
    drying in the salt air. Broad sole, chewed heel. She touched it lightly, testing
    moisture against her glove. Not hours old. Minutes. She marked the spot with flagged
    tape.


    She was thinking of another harbor, another morning, a knot she’d misread because
    she trusted a witness over the wind. She did not let that memory finish.


    “Chen!” Officer Bennett’s voice cut across the fog, younger than it should be
    for a man with a widow’s peak. “We got something by the seawall.”


    Sarah’s pencil stilled. The buoy toll went uncounted. “Baseline established,”
    she said, and followed the voice.


    The body surfaced where the fog thinned, as if the town exhaled it. Male, mid-thirties,
    sweatshirt bloated with water. The surf pushed him against the seawall, a rhythmic
    insistence that left dark stains on stone. Sarah raised a hand; Bennett froze
    on slick steps. She crouched, extended a hooked pole to snag the hoodie without
    snagging anything else. Her motions were measured, small.


    “Photos first,” she said. Bennett complied, flash swallowed, strangely private
    in the fog. On the third shot, Sarah steadied the chin with two fingers and made
    a slow inventory: healed scar above the eye; three small tattoos along the wrist—waves,
    a matchstick, something like an anchor broken in two. Grit lined his shoes. She
    scraped a sample into a vial. River silt? No. Ground shell. Elsewhere.


    She lifted a shoelace between pinched gloves. Her fingers knew the rhythm, the
    turn and bite. A faint pulse of heat ran up her wrist—memory like a static shock.
    She set it aside, breath even. A gull cried twice and went silent. She noted the
    silence.


    Her phone vibrated; the cracked corner reflected a sliver of her face. IA wants
    final statement—Boston PD. She flicked the banner away and finished bagging the
    laces with care so precise it felt like penance.


    “Know him?” Bennett asked.


    “No,” she said, and let the word sit cleanly. It wasn’t the face; it was the pattern
    of fiber, the way the knot cinched under strain. She had taken a class on knots
    afterward, a month of practicing on lamp cords until muscle memory overruled pride.
    She cataloged the tremor in her hand, then stilled it by tightening her grip on
    the pole.


    From the dock above, a shadow resolved into Greg Larkin, owner of the bait shop
    that smelled like old coin and fish blood. “That’s a shame,” he said, voice flat.
    He pulled his cap low. “Season’s bad enough without bodies scaring off the last
    stragglers.”


    “You see anything?” Sarah asked.


    “Fog,” he said. “Same as you.”


    She noted his boots—dry, though the boards were wet where he stood. A piece of
    green-stained twine dangled from his pocket. She tucked the detail away like a
    shell to turn later in the hand.


    “Who handles bait runs at night?” she asked.


    Greg’s jaw worked. “Close up at eight. Nobody’s call to make runs after.”


    Maeve’s throat cleared behind Sarah. “Fewer boats out this time of year,” she
    added, too quick. “Less need.”


    Sarah turned. Maeve’s cuffs were damp halfway to the elbow. She’d told Sarah the
    fog spooked her, kept her ashore. Sarah hadn’t asked yet. The harbor master looked
    past her into the whiteness, where sound folded in on itself and footsteps could
    vanish halfway through a dock.


    “ID,” Bennett said, holding up a soaked wallet in a gloved hand. The license fluttered.
    The name punched through the fog in Sarah’s head: Aaron Bell. She’d seen it on
    a transcript two years back, a dockworker who never showed for a deposition. A
    ghost who’d handled stolen phones and vanished after a girl died with a double
    constrictor knot chewing at her wrists.


    The tremor she’d cataloged earlier had a name now. The knot tied this harbor to
    Boston, tied Sarah to the thing she’d fled.


    She looked at Bennett waiting, at Maeve’s damp cuffs, at Greg’s dry boots on wet
    wood. The fog pressed close, swallowing the harbor’s edges, making secrets easier
    to carry and footsteps easier to lose. It was a shield if she wanted it, and a
    blind if she didn’t.


    “Bag the laces,” she said again, voice steady. “And get me a list of every boat
    that left after dark.”


    Her thumb hovered over two numbers in her recent calls: the Boston task force,

    “Detective,” said Maeve O’Doul, the harbor master, stepping lightly for someone

    Sarah held her finger on the notebook to mark her place. “Seven,” she said, eyes

    Buoy clang again. Sarah resumed the count without looking up, pencil hovering,
    then wrote the interval, matched it to tide tables smoothed over a manila envelope
    stamped with the town seal and her new badge number. At this hour, low water dragged
    sluggishly; anything tossed upriver would drift toward the breakwater. She traced
    the expected line with a gloved finger along the chart, then compared it to a
    ribbon of seaweed braided to a piling, slick fronds indicating flow. She moved
    down the dock, measuring distance by stride, then crouched by a footprint drying
    in the salt air. Broad sole, chewed heel. She touched it lightly, testing moisture
    against her glove. Not hours old. Minutes. She marked the spot with flagged tape.


    She was thinking of another harbor, another morning, a knot she’d misread because
    she trusted a witness over the wind. She did not let that memory finish.


    “Chen!” Officer Bennett’s voice cut across the fog, younger than it should be
    for a man with a widow’s peak. “We got something by the seawall.”


    Sarah’s pencil stilled. The buoy toll went uncounted. “Baseline established,”
    she said, and followed the voice.

    Her phone vibrated; the cracked corner reflected a sliver of her face. IA wants
    final statement—Boston PD. She flicked the banner away and finished bagging the
    laces with care so precise it felt like penance.


    “Know him?” Bennett asked.


    “No,” she said, tapping the sealed evidence bag twice with her thumbnail before
    passing it over.


    From the dock above, a shadow resolved into Greg Larkin, owner of the bait shop
    that smelled like old coin and fish blood. Fog beaded on the brim of his cap and
    fell in a slow drip, patting the boards between them. “That’s a shame,” he said,
    voice dampened by the air. He pulled his cap low. “Season’s bad enough without
    bodies scaring off the last stragglers.”


    “You see anything?” Sarah asked.


    “Fog,” he said. “Same as you.”


    She noted his boots—dry, though the boards were wet where he stood. A piece of
    green-stained twine dangled from his pocket. As he shifted, the fog slid across
    him and back, erasing his shoulders, returning his mouth. She tucked the detail
    away like a shell to turn later in the hand.


    “Who handles bait runs at night?” she asked.


    Greg’s jaw worked. “Close up at eight. Nobody’s call to make runs after.”


    Maeve’s throat cleared behind Sarah. “Fewer boats out this time of year,” she
    added, too quick. “Less need.”


    A strand of fog moved between Maeve and Sarah like gauze. Moisture slicked Maeve’s
    lashes; her cuffs were damp halfway to the elbow. She’d told Sarah the fog spooked
    her, kept her ashore. Sarah hadn’t asked yet. The harbor master looked past her
    into the whiteness, where sound folded in on itself and footsteps could vanish
    halfway through a dock.


    “ID,” Bennett said, holding up a soaked wallet in a gloved hand. The license fluttered.
    The name punched through the fog in Sarah’s head: Aaron Bell. She’d seen it on
    a transcript two years back, a dockworker who never showed for a deposition. A
    ghost who’d handled stolen phones and vanished after a girl died with a double
    constrictor knot chewing at her wrists.


    The tremor she’d cataloged earlier had a name now. The knot tied this harbor to
    Boston, tied Sarah to the thing she’d fled.


    She looked at Bennett waiting, at Maeve’s damp cuffs, at Greg’s dry boots on wet
    wood. The fog pressed close, swallowing the harbor’s edges, making secrets easier
    to carry and words easier to blur. It was a shield if she wanted it, and a blind
    if she didn’t.


    “Bag the laces,” she said again, voice steady. “And get me a list of every boat
    that left after dark.”


    Her thumb hovered over two numbers in her recent calls: the Boston task force,
    or no one at all. In the muffled harbor, she brought the phone to her ear.'

    **SCORE: 0.95**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n1. Methodical nature shown through action:\
    \ \"pencil hovering, then wrote the interval, matched it to tide tables...traced\
    \ the expected line with a gloved finger...measured distance by stride...crouched\
    \ by a footprint...tested moisture against her glove.\"\n2. Fog serves narrative\
    \ purpose: \"It was a shield if she wanted it, and a blind if she didn't.\"\n\
    3. Local secrets established: Greg's dry boots on wet boards; Maeve's damp cuffs\
    \ despite claiming fog keeps her ashore; Maeve's suspiciously quick clarification\
    \ about fewer boats.\n4. Past hinted early: \"She was thinking of another harbor,\
    \ another morning, a knot she'd misread because she trusted a witness over the\
    \ wind.\"\n5. Decision, not resolution: \"Her thumb hovered over two numbers in\
    \ her recent calls: the Boston task force, or no one at all.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\
    \ All constraints are satisfied with sophistication. Minor note: The phrase \"\
    a girl died with a double constrictor knot chewing at her wrists\" is your payoff,\
    \ but you might foreshadow this knot-tying detail even subtly earlier. The shoelace\
    \ moment (\"Her fingers knew the rhythm, the turn and bite\") lands better because\
    \ of this, but making readers sense Sarah's expertise with knots before the reveal\
    \ would deepen the narrative irony.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: Beat Execution**\n\n\
    **SCORE: 0.93**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- **Setup:** Establishes Sarah's methodical\
    \ counting, Maeve as harbor master, Greg as bait shop owner, the foggy harbor\
    \ town.\n- **Inciting Incident:** \"The body surfaced where the fog thinned\"\
    \ followed by Bennett's discovery.\n- **First Plot Point:** \"Aaron Bell. She'd\
    \ seen it on a transcript two years back, a dockworker who never showed for a\
    \ deposition...The knot tied this harbor to Boston, tied Sarah to the thing she'd\
    \ fled.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The beats are clearly executed and well-paced. The\
    \ only refinement: the connection crystallizes almost instantaneously upon seeing\
    \ the name. You might stretch this slightly—have Sarah initially examine the body\
    \ without recognizing him, *then* the wallet identification hits. Currently: \"\
    ID, Bennett said\" → immediate recognition. A heartbeat of delay (\"She studied\
    \ the swollen face again. A scar. Those tattoos.\") before the name confirms it\
    \ would amplify the horror of recognition.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: Character Voice**\n\
    \n**SCORE: 0.95**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \nSarah's methodology is conveyed entirely\
    \ through specific actions:\n- \"holding her finger on the notebook to mark her\
    \ place\"\n- \"flagged tape\" marking the suspicious footprint\n- \"extended a\
    \ hooked pole to snag the hoodie without snagging anything else\"\n-"

    \ \n1. Methodical nature shown through action: \"pencil hovering, then wrote the\

    \ Minor note: The phrase \"a girl died with a double constrictor knot chewing\
    \ at her wrists\" is your payoff, but you might foreshadow this knot-tying detail\
    \ even subtly earlier. The shoelace moment (\"Her fingers knew the rhythm, the\
    \ turn and bite\") lands better because of this, but making readers sense Sarah's\
    \ expertise with knots before the reveal would deepen the narrative irony.\n\n\

  content: 'The fog moved like a living thing, a gray tide that swallowed the harbor
    and gave it back in breaths. Sarah Chen stood at the edge of the warped planks,
    counting. Buoy clang: three seconds apart—one, two—


    “Detective,” said Maeve O’Doul, the harbor master, stepping lightly for someone
    whose boots could anchor a sloop. “You’ve been staring at that same tide graph
    for ten minutes.”


    Sarah held her finger on the notebook to mark her place. “Seven,” she said, eyes
    on the water. “I’m establishing baseline conditions.”


    “You could just ask me,” Maeve said, half a laugh. Behind her, empty shops pressed
    their faces to the harbor, faded signs promising chowder in warmer months.


    Buoy clang again. Sarah resumed the count without looking up, pencil hovering,
    then wrote the interval, matched it to tide tables smoothed over a manila envelope
    stamped with the town seal and her new badge number. At this hour, low water dragged
    sluggishly; anything tossed upriver would drift toward the breakwater. She traced
    the expected line with a gloved finger along the chart, then compared it to a
    ribbon of seaweed braided to a piling, slick fronds indicating flow. She moved
    down the dock, measuring distance by stride, then crouched by a footprint drying
    in the salt air. Broad sole, chewed heel. She touched it lightly, testing moisture
    against her glove. Not hours old. Minutes. She marked the spot with flagged tape,
    cinching the strip with two turns and a tuck, tightening it until it bit the splintered
    rail.


    She was thinking of another harbor, another morning, a knot she’d misread because
    she trusted a witness over the wind. She did not let that memory finish.


    “Chen!” Officer Bennett’s voice cut across the fog, younger than it should be
    for a man with a widow’s peak. “We got something by the seawall.”


    Sarah’s pencil stilled. The buoy toll went uncounted. “Baseline established,”
    she said, and followed the voice.


    The body surfaced where the fog thinned, as if the town exhaled it. Male, mid-thirties,
    sweatshirt bloated with water. The surf pushed him against the seawall, a rhythmic
    insistence that left dark stains on stone. Sarah raised a hand; Bennett froze
    on slick steps. She crouched, extended a hooked pole to snag the hoodie without
    snagging anything else. Her motions were measured, small.


    “Photos first,” she said. Bennett complied, flash swallowed, strangely private
    in the fog. On the third shot, Sarah steadied the chin with two fingers and made
    a slow inventory: healed scar above the eye; three small tattoos along the wrist—waves,
    a matchstick, something like an anchor broken in two. Grit lined his shoes. She
    scraped a sample into a vial. River silt? No. Ground shell. Elsewhere.


    She lifted a shoelace between pinched gloves. Her fingers fell into a practiced
    rhythm—the turn and bite—and a faint pulse of heat ran up her wrist, memory like
    a static shock. She set it aside, breath even. A gull cried twice and went silent.
    She noted the silence.


    Her phone vibrated; the cracked corner reflected a sliver of her face. IA wants
    final statement—Boston PD. She flicked the banner away and finished bagging the
    laces with care so precise it felt like penance.


    “Know him?” Bennett asked.


    “No,” she said, tapping the sealed evidence bag twice with her thumbnail before
    passing it over.


    From the dock above, a shadow resolved into Greg Larkin, owner of the bait shop
    that smelled like old coin and fish blood. Fog beaded on the brim of his cap and
    fell in a slow drip, patting the boards between them. “That’s a shame,” he said,
    voice dampened by the air. He pulled his cap low. “Season’s bad enough without
    bodies scaring off the last stragglers.”


    “You see anything?” Sarah asked.


    “Fog,” he said. “Same as you.”


    She noted his boots—dry, though the boards were wet where he stood. A piece of
    green-stained twine dangled from his pocket. As he shifted, the fog slid across
    him and back, erasing his shoulders, returning his mouth. She tucked the detail
    away like a shell to turn later in the hand.


    “Who handles bait runs at night?” she asked.


    Greg’s jaw worked. “Close up at eight. Nobody’s call to make runs after.”


    Maeve’s throat cleared behind Sarah. “Fewer boats out this time of year,” she
    added, too quick. “Less need.”


    A strand of fog moved between Maeve and Sarah like gauze. Moisture slicked Maeve’s
    lashes; her cuffs were damp halfway to the elbow. She’d told Sarah the fog spooked
    her, kept her ashore. Sarah hadn’t asked yet. The harbor master looked past her
    into the whiteness, where sound folded in on itself and footsteps could vanish
    halfway through a dock.


    “ID,” Bennett said, holding up a soaked wallet in a gloved hand. The license fluttered.


    Sarah studied the face again. Swelling softened the jawline, but the scar above
    the eye held its shape; the tattoos were clean, deliberate. The fog tugged at
    her sleeves, and something tight drew across her shoulders.


    The name punched through next: Aaron Bell. She’d seen it on a transcript two years
    back, a dockworker who never showed for a deposition. A ghost who’d handled stolen
    phones and vanished after a girl died with a double constrictor knot chewing at
    her wrists.


    The tremor she’d cataloged earlier had a name now. The knot tied this harbor to
    Boston, tied Sarah to the thing she’d fled.
