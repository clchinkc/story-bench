  evidence: 'Across versions the piece steadily improved. V0 set an evocative premise
    but relied on visible metaphors of sound; V1 introduced richer non-visual sensory
    detail (rhythms, metallic scrape, smells) and grounded Imani in tactile/auditory
    perception; V2 made only incremental changes; V3 sharpened technical auditory
    specifics (60 Hz, 2.3s pulse) and added clearer characterization. The final version
    preserves those strengths and adds plot beats (Catalyst, Fun and Games, Bad Guys
    Close In) and a satisfying twist (Marcus''s betrayal revealed in layered audio).
    However, the iteration missed a key constraint: Imani''s blindness is only implied
    via her trained ear and attentiveness rather than being explicitly and respectfully
    presented as a strength. The audio clues (dial frequency, underlying breathing,
    Marcus''s off-mic line) are concrete and serve as the crucial turning point; Marcus''s
    initial underestimation is present; the Fun and Games section is engaging before
    turning dark. These successes explain high preservation and improvement scores,
    while the omission of explicit blindness depiction reduced feedback_responsiveness
    and narrative_quality slightly.'
