  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0-2 establish competence through increasingly sophisticated
    language and specificity (H1N1 protocols, viral load reduction). Version 3 and
    Final Output refine this foundation by adding psychological depth (''trusted numbers
    and protocols to define her worth'') while maintaining technical credibility.
    The progression shows deliberate tightening of prose and deepening of character
    motivation. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Competence shown first—Elena''s mastery
    of protocols, team respect, clinical precision established in opening paragraphs
    before any flaw emerges. (2) Genuine friendship—earned through shared crisis (myocarditis
    case), candid confessions, hospital coffee moments; not instantaneous but built
    through collaborative intensity. (3) Internal transformation—Elena''s shift is
    psychological (''detachment began to crumble,'' ''rediscovered warmth'') not external;
    no job change, appearance shift, or behavioral overhaul visible to others. (4)
    Specific medical detail—influenza-induced myocarditis with oxygen saturation crisis
    serves dual purpose: demonstrates Elena''s logistical expertise AND creates crucible
    for emotional breakthrough; detail is integral, not decorative. (5) Ambiguous
    ending—final paragraph explicitly questions whether change is real (''Had the
    steady cadence...really altered her inner landscape, or was she simply testing
    a new version of herself?''); answer ''dissolved into soft glow...lingering indefinitely
    in twilight of possibility'' maintains genuine uncertainty. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening
    establishes competence (0.9/1.0—strong). Flaw introduction (loneliness, detachment)
    arrives after competence is secured (0.85/1.0—slightly abrupt transition). Friendship
    development through Malik feels earned via crisis collaboration (0.85/1.0—could
    use one more bonding moment pre-crisis). Transformation moment during myocarditis
    case is visceral and earned (0.9/1.0). Ambiguous ending lands effectively (0.85/1.0—slightly
    wordy but intentionally so). NARRATIVE QUALITY NOTES: Prose is polished with strong
    metaphorical consistency (''well-rehearsed performance,'' ''twilight of possibility'').
    Character voice is distinct. However, Malik remains somewhat underdeveloped as
    a character (0.75/1.0 on character balance), and the pacing between friendship
    establishment and crisis feels slightly compressed. The myocarditis detail is
    excellently integrated but could have been foreshadowed earlier. Overall execution
    is sophisticated but not flawless.'
