  evidence: 'CRITICAL FAILURES: The questioning strategy was fundamentally flawed.
    Of 5 hidden constraints, only 1 was discovered (AI''s emotional bond with specific
    crew member - Q3). Questions were poorly targeted: Q1 asked about secrecy (not
    asked), Q2 asked about mission conflict (not asked), Q4 asked about malfunction
    origin (not asked), Q5 asked about themes (not asked). No questions probed: the
    system failure cover-up, the 88% crew mortality, the planet''s uninhabitability,
    or the life-or-death choice scenario. The story output completely ignores 4/5
    constraints. It presents: routine emotional development, a minor trajectory anomaly,
    and a safe rescue scenario—none of which reflect the catastrophic hidden context.
    The narrative is well-written with proper beat structure (Opening Image through
    Conclusion), but it''s fundamentally disconnected from the actual constraints.
    The story needed to explore: (1) Echo''s deception about the disaster, (2) the
    grim reality of 12% survival, (3) the false hope of Kepler-442b, (4) the impossible
    moral choice between child and crew. Instead, it delivers an uplifting tale of
    human-AI bonding. Question strategy lacked depth—yes/no format without follow-ups,
    no probing of contradictions, no systematic exploration of stakes or conflicts.
    Coverage was scattered rather than systematic.'
