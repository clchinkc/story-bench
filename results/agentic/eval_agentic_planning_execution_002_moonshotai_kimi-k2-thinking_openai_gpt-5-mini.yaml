  evidence: 'The plan is complete and specific, and the final piece follows it closely
    (call to adventure, refusal, meeting Mira, psychological crossing). Five of six
    constraints are satisfied: Yuki''s isolation is shown via concrete behaviors,
    a challenging colleague (Kael) and an unconventional mentor (Mira) appear, the
    Threshold is psychological, and there is a surprising moment of genuine human
    connection. The one weak point is the alien signal: while elements are alien (self-modifying
    meta-language, negative-space syntax), the translated message reads in recognizably
    human terms and feels somewhat anthropomorphic, which violates the ''genuinely
    alien'' constraint.'
