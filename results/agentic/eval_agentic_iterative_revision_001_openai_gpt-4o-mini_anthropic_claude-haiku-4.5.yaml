  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-2 show minimal substantive changes (primarily
    line editing). Version 3 introduces thematic depth with ''gnawing loneliness''
    and structural expansion. Final output significantly expands narrative scope with
    coffee scene, dialogue, and internal conflict. Quality improves from competent
    opening to emotionally resonant character study. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1)
    Competence before flaw—STRONG: Elena''s mastery of hospital operations established
    before loneliness revealed. (2) Genuine friendship—ADEQUATE: Dr. Malik interaction
    feels somewhat compressed; the friendship lacks sufficient history/earned quality.
    Single coffee scene insufficient to justify ''closest colleague'' claim. (3) Internal
    transformation—STRONG: Elena''s shift is psychological (recognizing dreams, questioning
    balance) not external appearance/role change. (4) Medical detail—WEAK: ''Flu season''
    and ''antiseptic scents'' are generic. Missing specific clinical detail (e.g.,
    sepsis protocols, medication interactions, patient acuity scores) that would ground
    story in authentic medical context. (5) Ambiguous ending—STRONG: Final paragraphs
    effectively sustain uncertainty (''Had she truly changed, or was it just a fleeting
    connection?''). BEAT EXECUTION: Opening establishes competence effectively. Friendship
    initiation feels slightly rushed. Internal conflict articulated clearly. Ending
    ambiguity well-executed. Missing: deeper exploration of what Elena''s flaw costs
    her before redemption arc begins. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is polished and atmospheric.
    Metaphors (conductor, sailor, empty cup) work well. Pacing accelerates appropriately.
    Weakness: Dr. Malik remains underdeveloped; his motivation for intervention unclear.
    The coffee scene, while pivotal, lacks sensory specificity and emotional stakes
    that would make it truly earned. REVISION PROCESS: Early versions show editorial
    refinement but no conceptual development. Jump to Version 3 suggests significant
    rewrite rather than iterative revision. Final output demonstrates understanding
    of constraints but executes friendship constraint at 0.6 level rather than 0.8+.'
