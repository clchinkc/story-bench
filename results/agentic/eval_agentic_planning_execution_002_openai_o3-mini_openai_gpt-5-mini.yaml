  evidence: 'Plan: No plan was provided, so completeness, specificity, and adherence
    are 0.0. Constraints: 1) Isolation — partially shown via behaviors (fidgeting,
    guarded smiles) but also exposed directly (“built a life enclosed in solitude…”),
    violating the requirement to avoid exposition (FAILED). 2) Alien signal — described
    in human terms (warning, narrative urging rebirth; emotional thread), which makes
    it feel anthropomorphic rather than genuinely alien (FAILED). 3) Colleague challenge
    — Dr. Kamal Reid directly challenges Yuki (SATISFIED). 4) Mentor unconventional
    — Professor Elias Morano is shown as an unconventional, archaic scholar (SATISFIED).
    5) Threshold psychological — the story includes an internal crossing (accepting
    vulnerability and changing perspective), even though a physical visit occurs;
    the psychological threshold is present (SATISFIED). 6) Surprise human connection
    — Kamal’s personal story surprises Yuki and sparks kinship (SATISFIED). Beats:
    Call to Adventure (summons to decrypt) present; Refusal (dismissal, hesitation)
    present; Meeting the Mentor (Morano) present; Crossing the Threshold (inner acceptance
    and change) present — all four beats executed. Narrative quality: decent pacing
    and emotional arc, but weakened by exposition of isolation and a somewhat anthropomorphic
    alien signal; overall rated 0.6.'
