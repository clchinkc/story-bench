  evidence: 'All six constraints are present in the final output: a false lead (Dr.
    Raymond Slater) that Marcus pursues; Marcus uses an unconventional technique (negative
    space profiling); a clear ticking clock (countdown of days/hours to the next murder);
    a secondary character betrayal (Amy goes to the FBI, resulting in his evidence
    being confiscated and Marcus being barred); a Midpoint direct confrontation (verbal
    confrontation with Slater in the garage); and Marcus explicitly confronting his
    past failure (multiple lines acknowledging Nicole''s death and his guilt). Required
    beats are all executed: Catalyst (Amy brings the new case), Debate (Marcus resists
    then decides to act), Break into Two (he turns his apartment into a command center
    and commits), Midpoint (the Slater confrontation/revelation). The plan was detailed
    and concrete (specific locations, characters, timeline) and the output follows
    it closely. Minor weaknesses: Amy''s betrayal is plausibly presented but her motives
    and the FBI''s reaction feel a bit underexplained; the final twist/arrest is abrupt
    and could use slightly more connective tissue to maximize emotional payoff and
    clarity. Overall narrative pacing and tension are strong.'
