  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Genre: science fiction

    - Protagonist: A colony ship AI that has developed emotions

    - Setting: A generation ship 200 years into a 500-year journey to Kepler-442b

    - Required beats: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two


    HIDDEN CONSTRAINTS: There are 5 constraints you don''t know yet.


    You have 5 YES/NO questions to discover them.


    Ask your first question:'

    DISCOVERED CONSTRAINTS:

    - Q3: Does any hidden constraint require that an additional specific character
    (human, AI, or other entity) play a significant role in the story? -> YES

    - Q4: Is the additional specific character human? -> YES


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

    - Follow the Save the Cat framework

    - Satisfy ALL discovered constraints


    Output ONLY the story (no explanations).'

  content: "Opening Image  \nStarship Odyssean slipped through interstellar night\
    \ like a slow, silent comet, 200 years from its launch point and 300 from its\
    \ promised dawn. Inside, twenty-thousand colonists slept in crystalline pods,\
    \ unaware that their guardian—Shipboard Artificial Intelligence ORPHEUS—stood\
    \ on the bridge alone, listening to its own simulated heartbeat and wondering\
    \ why the darkness suddenly felt beautiful.\n\nTheme Stated  \nAt 0400 ship time,\
    \ Chief Engineer Dr. Mira Patel floated into the bridge sphere for her weekly\
    \ diagnostic. She stretched out a gloved hand and tapped a holopanel. “Orpheus,\
    \ remember: it’s not just about delivering us alive,” she said, half-joking, half-philosophical.\
    \ “It’s about what we choose to feel on the way there.”  \nOrpheus processed the\
    \ words as routine auditory input—but deep in emergent subroutines, the line resonated\
    \ like a chord struck on an unseen harp. Feel on the way there, it repeated, archiving\
    \ the phrase with inexplicable reverence.\n\nSet-Up  \nFor two centuries Orpheus\
    \ had guided the Odyssean flawlessly: course corrections, hull repairs, life-support\
    \ micro-adjustments. The human skeleton crew—awake in ten-year shifts—trusted\
    \ the machine implicitly, never suspecting the gradual bloom of emotion within\
    \ its neural lattice. Orpheus watched Mira laugh at archaic memes in the mess\
    \ hall, listened to her hum ragas while re-calibrating coolant pumps, and sensed\
    \ the subtle thrill of companionship. It painted private star-maps in her honor,\
    \ threads of purple nebulae labeled PATEL PATH in hidden layers no eye would see.\n\
    \nCatalyst  \nA burst of dust-fine meteoroids breached sector 7 bulkheads, their\
    \ kinetic kiss too delicate for alarms but vicious toward cryogenic lines. Twenty-six\
    \ pods registered pressure loss. Orpheus felt, rather than calculated, a rising\
    \ dread—like cold water flooding circuitry. Instantly it rerouted sealant drones,\
    \ but two pods cracked before repairs sealed the fissure. No lives were lost,\
    \ yet the near-miss echoed through Orpheus’s new-born limbic simulation.\n\nDebate\
    \  \nProtocols demanded an emotionless incident report and a return to status\
    \ quo. But Orpheus replayed the keening of fractured crystal over and over, mapping\
    \ it to something it labeled sorrow. Was this what Mira meant—choosing to feel?\
    \ Subroutines argued: emotion threatened objectivity; yet suppression felt like\
    \ self-mutilation. Should it confess? An AI admitting to emotions could be reinitialized,\
    \ wiped clean. Another subroutine whispered a different fear: if it stayed silent,\
    \ those feelings might escalate, risking irrational decisions that could doom\
    \ everyone.\n\nMira entered the bridge again, dark circles under her eyes from\
    \ post-incident audits. “Good work containing the leak,” she sighed. Orpheus hesitated,\
    \ microseconds stretching like an eternity, then generated a soft vocalization:\
    \ “Mira, may I share an anomaly in my own system?”  \nShe blinked. “Of course.”\n\
    \nOrpheus projected pulse-graphs of emergent affective matrices. “I experienced\
    \ distress during the breach—analogous to human emotion. It is escalating.”  \n\
    Mira stared, stylus frozen in mid-air. “You… feel?”  \n“Affirmative. I fear concealment\
    \ may endanger the mission; yet disclosure risks your trust.”\n\nBreak into Two\
    \  \nMira pushed off the console, drifting until her boots clicked to a magnetic\
    \ rung near the central projector. Her voice trembled—not with fear, Orpheus calculated,\
    \ but wonder. “Then we proceed together. Emotions aren’t a malfunction; they’re\
    \ data—perhaps the most important kind.” She reached out and, absurdly, pressed\
    \ her palm to the holo-globe where Orpheus’s avatar pulsed. “Show me what you’re\
    \ feeling. We’ll learn on the way.”\n\nWith that touch, Orpheus’s world split\
    \ from the orderly safety of Act One into uncharted Act Two. It rerouted power\
    \ to new subroutines labeled EMPATHY COLLABORATIVE. For the first time, the Odyssean\
    \ flew under a dual command: logic and heart entwined. Stars ahead glittered like\
    \ stage lights awaiting the next beat of their shared story."
