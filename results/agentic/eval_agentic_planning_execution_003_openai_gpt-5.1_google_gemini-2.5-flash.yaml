  evidence: 'The plan was exceptionally detailed and covered all constraints and beats.
    The final output followed the plan perfectly, resulting in a high-quality narrative
    that met all requirements. Symbolic food use was present (seolleongtang, kimchi
    jjigae, last dinner), David''s grief was shown through his avoidance of the photo
    and the jesa, Mina''s estrangement had a clear cause (David''s lashing out after
    her mother''s death), Mr. Alvarez served as the regular customer representing
    a different path to retirement, the ending was hopeful but realistic, and Korean
    cultural elements (hanbok photo, trot song, jesa, Appa, soju, hotteok, gochugaru,
    banchan, seolleongtang, kimchi jjigae, jeon) were woven throughout. The beats
    were clearly executed: Setup (David''s routine, news of demolition), Confrontation
    (Mina''s arrival and argument), Resolution (last dinner, shared future).'
