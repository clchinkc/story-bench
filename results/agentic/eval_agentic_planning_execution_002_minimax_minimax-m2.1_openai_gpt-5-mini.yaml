  evidence: 'Plan completeness/specificity: plan explicitly addresses all constraints
    and required beats with concrete details (times, elevator, drone, deleted drafts,
    mentor arrival). Plan adherence: final output matches plan closely—shows behavioral
    isolation, delivers an alien- feeling signal, includes Emil who challenges Yuki
    and acts unconventionally, psychological threshold, and a surprising human connection
    (hand on shoulder). Constraints: all six satisfied—isolation shown through behaviors
    (routine, drone, elevator, headphones), signal described as alien (reordered periodic
    table, 17-note scale, indifferent patterns), colleague/mentor challenges her (Emil),
    mentor is unconventional (invades apartment, cooks, uses personal anecdotes),
    threshold is psychological (internal decision and symbolic elevator descent),
    and a genuine surprising human connection occurs. Beats: all four present—Call
    to Adventure (signal arrival), Refusal (delay/deleted drafts), Meeting the Mentor
    (Emil''s visit), Crossing the Threshold (phone call to join team/elevator as psychological
    descent). Narrative quality: strong pacing, evocative details and tension; scores
    slightly below exceptional due to relatively straightforward resolution of refusal
    and mentor acceptance (0.8).'
