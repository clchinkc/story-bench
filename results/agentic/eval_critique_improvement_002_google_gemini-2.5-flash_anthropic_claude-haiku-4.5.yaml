  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer addressed emotional complexity feedback
    by deepening Marcus''s internal conflict and adding sensory details (jaw twitching,
    adjusting glasses). However, the revisions show minimal structural changes—mostly
    cosmetic additions (Thai takeout specificity, protein bars). The core story architecture
    remained stable rather than being fundamentally reconsidered based on critique.
    Score: 0.75.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0→V1→V2→V3 shows incremental refinement rather than breakthrough
    improvement. Changes are additive (more specific details) rather than transformative.
    The ''World''s Boss'' joke remained the anchor throughout, suggesting the writer
    was confident in core execution but didn''t substantially reimagine weak areas.
    The almost-break moment (glasses adjustment) was added late, suggesting reactive
    rather than proactive revision. Score: 0.70.


    PRESERVATION: Strengths were maintained—the writers'' room authenticity, Leonard''s
    thematic statement, Maya''s perceptiveness. The opening description remained vivid.
    However, the preservation score isn''t higher because the writer didn''t deepen
    what was already working (the joke mechanics, the industry details) while fixing
    gaps. Score: 0.80.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4/5):

    1. ✓ LAUGH BEFORE SAD: ''World''s Boss'' joke generates genuine laughter before
    three-year revelation. Clear satisfaction.

    2. ✓ THEME BY MINOR CHARACTER: Leonard explicitly states theme about connection
    and cringe. Satisfied.

    3. ✓ COMEDY CRAFT SPECIFICITY: Detailed joke structure (setup/callback/rule-of-threes
    on whiteboard), specific joke mechanics shown. Satisfied.

    4. ✓ NEW WRITER SEES THROUGH MARCUS: Maya''s ''uncomfortable assessment that seemed
    to peel back layers'' and her existential question directly threaten Marcus''s
    shell. She reads his deflection. Satisfied.

    5. ✗ ALMOST-BREAK WITH JOKE COVER: The glasses adjustment is a physical tell,
    but it''s not clearly an ''almost-break'' moment followed by a joke cover. Marcus''s
    response (''Existential dread? For a network sitcom?'') is deflection/sarcasm,
    not a joke that covers an emotional crack. The moment lacks the specificity of
    constraint 1''s execution. Partially satisfied at best. Score: 0.80 (4/5 clearly
    met).


    BEAT EXECUTION: Save the Cat structure is present but underdeveloped. Inciting
    incident (Maya''s arrival) is clear. Crossing the threshold (her question) happens.
    But the story lacks the midpoint reversal, false victory, and dark moment that
    would make beats feel earned. The ending is setup for future conflict rather than
    a complete beat sequence. Score: 0.75.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: The prose is strong—vivid sensory details, good pacing, authentic
    dialogue. Character voice is distinct. However, the emotional payoff is muted.
    We understand Marcus intellectually but don''t *feel* his pain as acutely as we
    could. Maya''s character, while perceptive, lacks interiority. The scene ends
    on tension rather than resolution, which works for a scene but leaves narrative
    satisfaction incomplete. Score: 0.78.


    KEY OBSERVATION: The writer demonstrated solid craft but conservative revision
    strategy. Critiques identified emotional complexity as the primary gap (0.75 scores
    across multiple reviews), yet revisions added details rather than deepening emotional
    architecture. The almost-break constraint remains the weakest execution—it''s
    present but not crystalline. This suggests the writer understood feedback intellectually
    but didn''t fully internalize the need for emotional specificity matching the
    joke specificity already achieved.'
