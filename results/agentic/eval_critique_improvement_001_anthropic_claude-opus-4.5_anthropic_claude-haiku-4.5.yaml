  evidence: 'CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: All five constraints are present and well-executed.
    (1) Methodical nature shown through action: prescription bottle arrangement, parallel
    counter wiping, precise towel folding, lamppost counting, systematic photography
    and documentation. (2) Fog serves narrative purpose: obscures evidence, creates
    disorientation, forces reliance on memory/touch, enables Walsh''s approach undetected,
    symbolizes Sarah''s moral blindness. (3) Local character secret: Walsh''s aborted
    pocket gesture and evasive behavior hint at hidden knowledge about Brennan/Webb.
    (4) Past case hinted before reveal: windshield-checking habit, morning anxiety,
    then Marcus Webb identification creates effective delayed revelation. (5) Ends
    on decision moment: Sarah chooses to re-engage with the case rather than defer
    to Portland.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Three required beats properly executed. Opening establishes methodical
    routine convincingly. Discovery scene builds tension through fog-obscured investigation.
    Climactic revelation (Webb''s identity + Walsh''s knowledge) forces decision point.


    CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Moderate. The three critiques (0.85, 0.90, 0.82) all
    praised constraint satisfaction and methodical characterization, suggesting the
    core work was sound. However, the revision trajectory shows VERSION 0-3 appear
    nearly identical in the provided text, indicating minimal substantive revision
    between critique rounds. The final output does not demonstrate clear responsiveness
    to specific critique feedback—no visible strengthening of weak areas, no iterative
    refinement visible.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Weak. Versions 0-3 are presented as identical or near-identical,
    suggesting either: (a) revisions were minimal/cosmetic, or (b) the revision process
    wasn''t captured. The final output is strong, but there''s no demonstrable improvement
    arc across the three critique cycles. Critiques were consistently positive (0.82-0.90
    range), which may explain lack of major revisions, but this also means limited
    opportunity to assess how the writer responds to constructive feedback.


    PRESERVATION: Strong. The opening image (prescription bottles, fog, harbor) is
    maintained throughout. Sarah''s voice remains consistent. The fog''s atmospheric/narrative
    function is preserved and deepened. Character details (Walsh''s pocket gesture,
    Sarah''s habits) are retained and developed.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong. Prose is precise and evocative. The fog metaphor works
    on multiple levels (literal obstruction, moral ambiguity, Sarah''s blindness to
    past consequences). The final decision moment is genuinely compelling—Sarah choosing
    re-engagement over safety. Pacing is controlled. Dialogue is sparse but effective.
    The reveal of Webb''s identity lands with appropriate weight.


    WEAKNESSES: (1) Limited visible revision process—critiques were positive but the
    lack of demonstrable changes makes it unclear if feedback was actively incorporated
    or if the piece was simply strong from the start. (2) Walsh''s characterization
    could be deeper—his secret is hinted but not fully developed. (3) The connection
    between Brennan case and Webb''s appearance could be more explicitly foreshadowed
    earlier. (4) Sarah''s emotional response to Webb''s body, while present, is somewhat
    muted—more visceral reaction might heighten stakes.'
