  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: V0→V1 shows minimal change (likely placeholder). V1→V2 demonstrates
    significant refinement: specific cultural details (*masa harina, café de olla*)
    replace generic markers; family relationships clarify (*Tío''s* auto shop); language
    becomes more precise and economical. V2→V3 achieves masterful distillation—removes
    redundancy while deepening resonance. Final output builds on V3 with full narrative
    arc, showing cumulative improvement in specificity, emotional authenticity, and
    thematic coherence.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5):

    1. INTERNAL CONFLICT SHOWN NOT TOLD: Mateo''s conflict manifests through concrete
    actions (hiding brochure, scribbling on receipts, distracted silence, physical
    symptoms like ''stone in his gut,'' hammering heart). Never explicitly labeled
    as conflicted.

    2. GRANDMOTHER CRYSTALLIZING MOMENT: The kitchen scene with *abuela* toasting
    chiles is the precise pivot point. Her metaphor about the ''busy plaza'' and *cascarones*
    reframes his choice from guilt to permission. This is earned, specific, and emotionally
    resonant.

    3. ADULT UNDERSTANDING: Ms. Garcia genuinely grasps his dilemma (''most responsible
    thing is to become fully yourself'') and recontextualizes his fear. Father''s
    recognition (''That''s how we know this IS a need'') shows deep understanding
    without judgment. Both adults validate rather than dismiss.

    4. AUTHENTIC CULTURAL ELEMENTS: Details are woven functionally—*masa harina, café
    de olla, caldo de res, rebozo, cascarones, chiles secos*—not listed. Spanish phrases
    emerge naturally in dialogue and thought. Family structure (*Tío*, *abuela*, multigenerational
    household) feels lived-in. The economic reality (bus routes, extra Saturdays,
    practical concerns) grounds culture in actual life.

    5. EARNED RESOLUTION: Mateo''s growth is demonstrated through: (a) moving from
    hiding to declaration, (b) mapping logistics himself, (c) speaking ''in a voice
    unfamiliar to his own ears,'' (d) the final image of him carrying multiple identities
    (''not leaving. building a room of his own''). Resolution doesn''t erase duty;
    it integrates aspiration.


    BEAT EXECUTION (19/20):

    ✓ Inciting incident: Brochure hidden, calculus books, grocery list—establishes
    tension

    ✓ Rising action: Ms. Garcia''s intervention, receipt discovery, distraction at
    home

    ✓ Crystallizing moment: *Abuela* scene with metaphor and permission

    ✓ Climax: Dinner table declaration with brochure

    ✓ Falling action: Father''s recognition, mother''s trust (''be home before dark'')

    ✓ Resolution: Integration, not escape; voice claimed within family structure

    ✓ Thematic coherence: Translation/voice/stories thread throughout

    ✓ Sensory specificity: Sun, dust, chiles, exhaust, *rebozo* scent

    ✓ Dialogue authenticity: Spanish phrases, rhythm of family speech

    ✓ Emotional truth: Vulnerability, fear, pride, complexity all present

    Minor gap: Could have shown one moment of Mateo actively writing/creating before
    final image, but this is negligible.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (19/20):

    Strengths: Prose is economical yet lyrical (''ledger of duties,'' ''terrain foreign
    to his flat, dutiful landscape''). Metaphors are earned and specific (*cascarones*,
    *plaza*, *room of his own*). Pacing accelerates appropriately. Dialogue carries
    weight. Cultural specificity enhances rather than decorates. Ending is neither
    triumphalist nor defeatist—it''s mature and complex.

    Minor consideration: The phrase ''a terrain foreign to his flat, dutiful landscape''
    is slightly abstract compared to the concrete specificity elsewhere, though it
    works thematically.


    REVISION PROCESS QUALITY:

    V0→V1: Minimal visible change suggests either placeholder or very subtle refinement.

    V1→V2: Substantial improvement—cultural specificity increases (*masa harina* vs.
    generic ''beans''), family relationships clarify (*Tío''s* shop), language tightens.

    V2→V3: Masterful compression—removes ''three'' from ''three library books,'' eliminates
    ''complicated English'' (shown through action instead), tightens opening. Each
    cut increases impact.

    Final: Expands V3 with full narrative architecture while maintaining V3''s precision.
    No regression; only addition of necessary beats.


    FEEDBACK RESPONSIVENESS: All five constraints appear to have been addressed systematically
    across revisions, with particular attention to showing vs. telling and cultural
    authenticity.'
