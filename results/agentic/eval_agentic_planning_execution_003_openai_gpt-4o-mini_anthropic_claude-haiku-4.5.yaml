  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is well-structured with clear beats and character arcs.
    Final output follows most plot points. All three required beats (Setup, Confrontation,
    Resolution) are present and executed. David''s grief is subtly woven throughout
    without explicit statement. Mr. Kim effectively represents something to David
    (father figure, community anchor). Ending is hopeful but realistic (new beginning,
    not perfect resolution). Kimchi Jjigae serves as symbolic food moment (family
    healing). WEAKNESSES: Food symbolism appears only once clearly (Kimchi Jjigae
    for reconciliation); the second symbolic use is underdeveloped—the opening dish
    for Mr. Kim lacks deeper symbolic weight beyond hospitality. Korean cultural element
    is limited to food (Kimchi Jjigae) and restaurant name; lacks additional cultural
    depth (e.g., specific traditions, ceremonies, or cultural practices beyond cuisine).
    Mia''s estrangement cause is stated but not sufficiently specific or believable—''not
    moving on from mother''s death'' is generic; lacks concrete, particular reasons
    (e.g., specific incident, broken promise, unmet expectations). Plan mentions ''Beat
    5: Decision Point'' but cuts off mid-sentence, suggesting incomplete planning.
    Output shows good emotional resonance but the constraint violations prevent higher
    scores. Narrative pacing is solid with appropriate tension and resolution, though
    the ending feels slightly rushed in the final paragraphs.'
