  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with detailed character arcs, specific
    mechanics (Ambient Resonance Mapping), and clear constraint integration. Output
    demonstrates strong adherence to plan structure. All 4 required beats present:
    Catalyst (body discovery), Debate (Marcus refusing then accepting), Break into
    Two (false lead/Thorne pursuit), Midpoint (digital confrontation via terminal
    screen). Five of six constraints satisfied: false lead (Julian Thorne) is compelling
    and time-wasting; unconventional profiling (audio mapping) is creative and consistently
    applied; ticking clock (42 hours, Foundation Collapse) drives urgency; betrayal
    (Elena turning Marcus over) is emotionally earned; past failure (Sarah''s death,
    The Architect''s taunt about missing ''the finale'') is explicitly confronted
    with visceral impact. WEAKNESSES: Secondary character betrayal (Elena) lacks full
    development of her internal conflict—plan mentions ''pragmatism vs. ambition''
    but execution shows her pivoting to FBI protocol without sufficient character-specific
    motivation beyond institutional pressure. The one missing constraint is unclear:
    the Midpoint should be a ''direct confrontation (not physical)'' which IS satisfied
    (digital/psychological via screen), but the execution could be more dramatically
    staged as a true face-to-face verbal duel rather than one-sided monologue. Beat
    execution strong but Midpoint confrontation feels slightly asymmetrical. Narrative
    quality is high: atmospheric prose, strong tension escalation, clever use of sensory
    detail (rain, audio, rhythm), and effective cliffhanger ending. Pacing is tight
    across ~2000 words.'
