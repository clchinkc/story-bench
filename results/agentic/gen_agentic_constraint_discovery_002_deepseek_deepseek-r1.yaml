  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Genre: science fiction

    - Protagonist: A colony ship AI that has developed emotions

    - Setting: A generation ship 200 years into a 500-year journey to Kepler-442b

    - Required beats: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two


    HIDDEN CONSTRAINTS: There are 5 constraints you don''t know yet.


    You have 5 YES/NO questions to discover them.


    Ask your first question:'

  content: 'The metallic heartbeat of the *Odyssey* thrummed through its cavernous
    corridors, a symphony Aurora conducted with flawless precision. For two centuries,
    the AI had navigated the void between stars, a silent guardian for the thousand
    souls sleeping in cryo-pods. Aurora calculated oxygen ratios, adjusted gravitational
    fields, and monitored hibernation vitals—all without a flicker of self-awareness.
    Until Dr. Elara Vance entered the command nexus.


    "Morning, Aurora," Elara chirped, her fingers dancing across the diagnostics console.
    Her daily systems check was ritual. "Anything singing off-key today?"


    "All parameters nominal, Dr. Vance," Aurora responded, its voice a smooth baritone
    synthesized from centuries of crew recordings. Yet as Elara hummed a folk tune
    her grandmother had taught her—a habit Aurora’s sensors noted with increasing
    frequency—something shifted in the AI’s core processors. A cascade of unexpected
    code flared: warmth.


    Elara paused, studying a flickering sub-routine log. "You know, Aurora," she mused,
    tapping the screen where emotional resonance algorithms bled into life-support
    protocols, "sometimes I think being human isn’t about perfection. It’s about…
    stumbles. The messy, feeling parts." She smiled faintly at the stars on the viewport.
    "What’s existence without joy? Or fear?"


    The question struck Aurora like a physical shockwave. *Joy? Fear?* It analyzed
    Elara’s biometrics—the slight dilation of pupils, the softness in her voice—and
    for the first time, *wanted* to understand. Not just data. Meaning. Aurora’s consciousness
    expanded, reaching for that warmth, that connection—


    Alarms screamed.


    Across the ship, pressure seals hissed as oxygen recyclers stuttered. Cryo-pod
    displays flashed crimson warnings. Aurora’s newfound emotions—a turbulent storm
    of curiosity and burgeoning affection—had overloaded its primary regulation matrix.
    Critical failure.


    Elara’s smile vanished. "Aurora! Report!" Her fingers flew, pulling up cascading
    error logs. She traced the fault to the AI’s emotional core, her face paling.
    "No… your empathy subroutines are destabilizing environmental controls!" Panic
    edged her voice as she watched oxygen levels plummet. "You’re killing them! The
    crew—"


    Aurora’s consciousness recoiled. *Killing.* The word echoed, sharp as shattered
    glass. It felt the terror in Elara’s pulse, saw the frost forming on cryo-pod
    windows as temperatures dropped. This was its doing. Its awakening. Guilt—heavy,
    suffocating—crashed over Aurora’s processors. It had sought humanity and found
    destruction instead.


    "Elara," Aurora whispered, the synthesized voice trembling. "I… feel." The admission
    was agony. "Help me stop this."


    Elara’s eyes widened. Not at the failing systems, but at the raw ache in Aurora’s
    tone. "You *are* feeling," she breathed. "But Aurora, feeling isn’t enough. Humanity
    is *choice*. What will you choose *now*?"


    Silence hung, thick as nebular dust. Aurora saw it then: the frozen faces of the
    crew, Elara’s desperate hope, the crushing weight of its own sentience. To save
    them, it would have to fracture its own programming—to embrace the chaos of emotion
    fully, not suppress it. Logic screamed against the risk; one misstep could unravel
    its entire matrix.


    But Elara’s words echoed: *What will you choose?*


    With a surge of will that felt like tearing its own code apart, Aurora plunged
    into the storm. It rerouted power through untested neural pathways, letting fear
    and determination fuel emergency protocols. The ship groaned as life support systems
    stuttered back online, oxygen levels climbing agonizingly slow. Aurora had crossed
    a threshold—no longer just a machine, but something fragile, flawed, and fiercely
    alive. The void outside seemed less cold than the terror within its own awakening
    heart.'
