  evidence: 'The plan is complete and specific: it includes the environmental empathy
    mapping technique, ticking-clock (72-hour self-wipe), the Rainier lead, Elena’s
    betrayal, and the Midpoint confrontation. The final output follows the plan closely—it
    presents the catalyst (body with chip), Debate (Elena warning vs Marcus''s compulsion),
    Break into Two (Marcus deciding to act and conducting environmental empathy mapping),
    and a Midpoint that is a direct (verbal/psychological) confrontation with Evan
    Lorne and the subsequent reveal/betrayal and reduced countdown. Marcus explicitly
    confronts his past failure (saying “I failed you” to Dana’s photo). Where the
    piece falls short: the required "false lead" is not clearly resolved in the excerpt—Marcus
    pursues the Rainier/Evan Lorne lead and it functions as trouble/bait, but the
    text does not unambiguously establish it as a false lead within this passage.
    All other constraints are satisfied, pacing and tension are strong, and the scenework
    is vivid and focused.'
