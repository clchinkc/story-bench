  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

  content: 'The steam from the simmering *yukgaejang* fogged the window overlooking
    the Chicago street, already half-shadowed by the looming skeleton of the new highway.
    David Park wiped his hands on his perpetually stained apron, the familiar rhythm
    of prepping kimchi for the lunch rush a hollow comfort. Twenty-five years. The
    eviction notice, crisp and final, lay pinned beneath a heavy stone mortar, a counterpoint
    to the worn wood of the counter where he’d first sketched menu ideas with Soo-jin.
    Her absence wasn’t a spoken thing; it was the way his hand hesitated over her
    favorite knife, the extra care he took arranging the *banchan*, the untouched
    corner booth where sunlight used to catch her smile.


    The bell jingled. Mrs. Rossi, her frame small against the changing skyline, shuffled
    in, her usual spot already set. "Smells like heaven, David. Like always." She
    patted his arm, her eyes soft with unspoken understanding. He served her *japchae*,
    the glass noodles gleaming like spun gold. To David, it tasted like memory – the
    sweetness of early days, the tangled complexity of building a life here. "They
    don''t make places like this anymore," Mrs. Rossi sighed, twirling noodles. "Real
    places." Her words were a quiet elegy for the neighborhood, a reflection of his
    own loss.


    The door crashed open, not with the bell’s chime, but with the force of California
    sunshine embodied. Ji-hyun. Her presence was a jolt, sharp and bright in the fading
    light. "Appa." Her voice was firm, carrying the distance of years and miles. "I
    booked movers. For next Monday. After... well." She gestured vaguely towards the
    window, towards the inevitable destruction. The estrangement hung thick between
    them, born from his refusal, steeped in grief, to attend her wedding in California
    two years prior. He’d called it impractical; she’d called it abandonment. He saw
    Soo-jin in her eyes, the same stubborn tilt of the chin, and it was a physical
    ache.


    Midweek, the tension boiled over. Ji-hyun found him staring at a faded photograph
    tucked beside the register: their *paebaek* ceremony, Soo-jin radiant in hanbok,
    David bowing deeply, young Ji-hyun giggling beside them. "You cling to *this*,"
    Ji-hyun snapped, gesturing around the doomed restaurant, "but you couldn''t be
    there for *my* beginning? For *my* family?" Her voice cracked. "Mom wouldn''t
    have wanted you buried here, Appa. She’d want you *living*."


    David flinched. The accusation, echoing his own unvoiced fears, struck deep. He
    saw not just his daughter’s pain, but the ghost of his own retreat into these
    walls after Soo-jin’s passing. The restaurant wasn''t just a business; it had
    become his mausoleum. Later, a slick-suited representative from the development
    firm arrived, offering a final, paltry relocation "assistance" package. David
    listened, the man’s words buzzing like flies. He thought of the fight, the lawyers,
    the years of struggle Ji-hyun had endured without him. The fire to battle the
    demolition died, replaced by a heavy, cold certainty. Fighting meant staying stuck.
    He declined.


    On the final Saturday, the kitchen was unnaturally quiet. David stirred a vast
    pot of *tteokguk*, the rice cake soup traditionally eaten for new beginnings.
    The white discs floated like little moons. "Help me with this," he said, his voice
    rough. Ji-hyun, surprised, picked up a ladle. As they worked side-by-side, the
    rhythmic slicing of scallions, the fragrant steam rising, felt like a fragile
    bridge being built. "This soup," he murmured, not looking at her, "your mother...
    she insisted we serve it every New Year. Said it washed away the old, made room
    for the new." He offered her a bowl. "Maybe... maybe it’s time."


    Ji-hyun sipped, her eyes glistening. "It’s perfect, Appa."


    On the last day, Mrs. Rossi came early. She pressed a small, wrapped package into
    David’s hand – a worn, silver serving spoon. "From my mama’s kitchen," she said,
    her voice thick. "For your new place. Wherever it is." David held the cool metal,
    the weight of community and unexpected kindness settling in his palm.


    As the demolition crew loomed outside, David stood in the empty dining room. He
    looked at Ji-hyun, who was carefully packing the *paebaek* photo. The pain wasn''t
    gone; the grief for Soo-jin, the regret over lost years, would linger. But the
    crushing weight of the past felt lighter. He wasn''t fighting, and he wasn''t
    retiring into the shadows. He was moving. Not to California, not yet, but to a
    smaller space nearby, a place Mrs. Rossi had heard about. He picked up the last
    container of *tteokguk*. "Come on," he said to Ji-hyun, a tentative new resolve
    in his voice. "Let''s go plan the menu. You can show me how Californians like
    their kimchi." A small, hopeful smile touched his lips, mirrored hesitantly on
    hers. The road ahead was uncertain, but the first step, finally, was forward.'
