  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0-2 show incremental sensory refinement (botanica
    detail, specific food names, Vans branding). Version 3 introduces the flyer and
    ring—structural pivots that transform the piece from setup into genuine conflict.
    Final output crystallizes this arc with full scene architecture. Quality compounds
    rather than plateaus.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. INTERNAL CONFLICT SHOWN NOT TOLD (0.98/1.0): The flyer hidden ''like contraband,''
    the ring ''pulsing radioactive,'' the breath ''hitching ragged''—all kinesthetic.
    His shoulders ''lock,'' then ''thrum.'' No exposition; pure embodied contradiction.
    Minor: Could have shown more pre-decision wavering in the chaos scene.


    2. GRANDMOTHER CRYSTALLIZING MOMENT (1.0/1.0): The ring scene is exceptional.
    Rosa''s monologue about Abuelo''s dignity + her explicit permission (''un hombre
    necesita su propio sueño también'') creates the hinge. The ring becomes both anchor
    and permission slip. Perfectly calibrated.


    3. ADULT UNDERSTANDING (0.98/1.0): Mr. Rivera''s ''Y tu corazón? What song does
    it sing?'' is genuine wisdom, not platitude. He acknowledges honor''s weight while
    questioning its totality. His cumin-salt breath grounds it in specificity. Mamá''s
    final recognition (''Tu sueño también importa'') completes the arc. Only minor:
    Could have shown Rivera''s own sacrifice more explicitly.


    4. CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY (0.95/1.0): Spanish integrated organically (not translated,
    not over-explained). Botanica, velas, saints, frijoles charros, rebozo, rosario
    de Guadalupe—all specific to Mexican-American Southwest. The lettuce-field reference
    and ''centavo by centavo'' honor real economic history. Reggaeton detail for Carlos
    feels lived-in. Minor: Birria reference slightly generic.


    5. EARNED RESOLUTION (0.94/1.0): Mateo doesn''t abandon duty; he redistributes
    it (Carlos covers shift). He doesn''t reject family; he reframes it (''build his
    own alongside it''). The final line—''fertile ground. Not perfect. Not free. But
    authentically, tremblingly *his*''—shows growth through acceptance of complexity,
    not escape. The ring beside the trackpad is earned symbolism. Minor: Could have
    shown one more moment of doubt post-submission.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.94/1.0):

    ✓ Inciting incident: Flyer + demands (V0→V3 strengthened)

    ✓ Grandmother moment: Ring scene (introduced V3, perfected in final)

    ✓ Mentor/ally: Mr. Rivera (V3 onward, well-integrated)

    ✓ Climactic choice: Carlos confrontation (final output, high stakes)

    ✓ Resolution: Application + reframing (final output, earned)

    ✓ Thematic closure: Ring as covenant (final output, resonant)


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.93/1.0):

    Strengths: Sensory precision (dust, cumin, butcher-shop musk, AC rattle). Dialogue
    feels natural and weighted. Pacing accelerates through chaos scene. Metaphors
    work (ring as radioactive, fertile ground, contraband). Emotional stakes clear
    without melodrama.


    Weaknesses: The 11:52 PM timer feels slightly convenient (though functional).
    Mamá''s arc could use one more scene to show her own conflict. The ''yesterday''s
    birria'' joke, while authentic, slightly undercuts the gravity.


    PROCESS NOTES:

    Versions 0-2 refined surface texture. Version 3 introduced structural architecture
    (flyer, ring, Mr. Rivera). Final output integrated all elements into cohesive
    emotional arc. Revisions show responsiveness to constraint requirements without
    losing voice. Preservation excellent: opening image maintained across all versions
    with deepening specificity.'
