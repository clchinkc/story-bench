  evidence: 'All six constraints are present: food symbolism appears multiple times
    (kimchi jjigae as veil; galbi, mandu as memory/bond); David''s grief is shown
    implicitly via the photo, his behavior, and lines like "I stayed because this
    place kept her close" (the text does state Ji-yeon''s death but primarily shows
    grief rather than naming it); Anna''s estrangement has a clear cause (David missed
    milestones after Ji-yeon''s illness); Mr. Lee is a regular who embodies history/resilience
    and offers moral counsel; the ending is bittersweet/hopeful (moving with Anna,
    keeps recipes) and includes a jesa rite as a Korean cultural element beyond food.
    The three required beats are executed (Act 1: demolition notice/setup; Act 2 midpoint:
    kitchen confrontation/overcooked jjigae; Act 3: farewell and decision to move).
    Writing is coherent, well-paced, and emotionally resonant, with only minor direct
    phrasing about Ji-yeon''s death and some familiar beats, hence a high but not
    perfect quality score.'
