  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Exceptional execution across nearly all dimensions. Yuki''s
    isolation is brilliantly shown through specific behaviors (echo-checking, noise-canceling
    headphones worn alone, eating in dark rooms, avoiding eye contact, three weeks
    without human speech). The alien signal is genuinely non-anthropomorphic—synesthetic-temporal,
    gravitational fluctuations translating to sensory experiences (burnt copper smell,
    coldness, decay, ash taste) rather than linguistic patterns. Dr. Vane effectively
    challenges Yuki''s intuitive approach with computational rigor, creating genuine
    ideological conflict. Dr. Thorne is unconventional as a mentor—living in sub-levels,
    using analog synthesizers, offering paradoxical wisdom rather than direct guidance.
    The threshold is purely psychological: Yuki must remove her noise-canceling headphones
    and surrender to sensory chaos, fundamentally shifting her relationship to connection.
    The human connection moment (Vane catching her arm during sensory overload) is
    genuinely surprising—the antagonist becomes anchor, subverting expectations. All
    four beats execute cleanly: Call (Antarctic Sequence), Refusal (claims of being
    ill-equipped), Mentor (Thorne''s unconventional guidance), Threshold (removing
    headphones, stepping into chaos). MINOR WEAKNESS: The ''genuine human connection''
    moment, while powerful, could be argued as slightly telegraphed given Vane''s
    earlier dismissiveness—though the execution transcends this through emotional
    authenticity. The signal''s message about cosmic loneliness borders on slightly
    anthropomorphic interpretation, though the sensory delivery mechanism remains
    alien. PACING: Excellent escalation from sterile apartment to Antarctic facility
    to sub-level revelation to climactic threshold crossing. PROSE QUALITY: Lyrical,
    precise, sensory-rich without purple prose. Dialogue reveals character efficiently.'
