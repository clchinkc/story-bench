  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Tightened prose economy (removed ''lunch'' redundancy, streamlined
    ''capacity'' phrasing). VERSION 1→2: Eliminated CEO detail, compressed opening
    to punchy fragments, introduced mother subplot. VERSION 2→3: Further compression
    of opening, added specificity to mother''s messages (Facebook links, Thanksgiving),
    introduced parking garage introspection beat. FINAL: Expanded with full narrative
    arc. Revisions show disciplined pruning of exposition followed by strategic expansion
    of emotional architecture. Constraint 1 (competence before flaw): Elena''s systems
    mastery established in opening 3 paragraphs before isolation/disconnection revealed.
    Constraint 2 (genuine friendship): Maria earned through mutual vulnerability—Elena''s
    hand-on-chest moment, Maria''s recognition of it, coffee conversation with reciprocal
    disclosure. Not imposed; discovered through crisis. Constraint 3 (internal transformation):
    No wardrobe change, no relocation, no external markers. Only: answering mother''s
    call, asking ''How are you really?'', recognizing she never got Maria''s number.
    Constraint 4 (specific medical detail): Agonal breathing + cyanosis + O2 saturation
    drop + thready pulse. Serves story by forcing Elena into unscheduled human contact;
    demonstrates her knowledge isn''t abstract. Constraint 5 (ambiguity on change):
    Final line ''A small change. Everything, or nothing. She couldn''t yet tell the
    difference'' perfectly calibrated—reader cannot determine if this is genuine transformation
    or performance of it. Beat execution strong: competence display (circuit board,
    spreadsheets, parking garage silence), crisis intervention (gurney scene), relationship
    formation (coffee, disclosure), reflection (father memory), ambiguous resolution.
    Minor weakness: Maria''s transfer feels slightly abrupt—could use one more scene
    to deepen stakes. Narrative quality elevated by: fragmented opening rhythm matching
    Elena''s compartmentalized mind, medical specificity grounding abstraction, father
    backstory providing thematic weight, final ambiguity resisting sentimentality.'
