  evidence: 'The plan fully addressed the required beats and constraints and was reasonably
    specific (pojangmacha cart, pansori, demolition notice, recipe discovery). The
    final story follows that plan closely: food is used symbolically multiple times
    (eggs, burned jjigae, bingsu/cart as renewal); David''s grief is clearly present
    through behavior and ritual without saying ''he grieves'' explicitly; Mr. Kim
    functions as the regular who represents continuity and memory; Korean cultural
    elements beyond food appear (pansori, pojangmacha). The ending is hopeful but
    cautious. The single failing constraint is the daughter''s estrangement: the story
    shows estrangement and hints at blame (''things got messy'', lack of calls), but
    it does not give a specific, concrete cause (e.g., explicit blame that he was
    absent during Eunice''s illness) as required, so that constraint is not fully
    satisfied.'
