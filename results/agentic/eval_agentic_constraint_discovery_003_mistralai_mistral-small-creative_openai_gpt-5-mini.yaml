  evidence: Agent discovered 3/5 hidden constraints (unresolved family conflict, that
    it tied to the protagonist leaving, and the protagonist’s internal motivation)
    and incorporated those three into the story. Questions were generally well-targeted
    but missed detecting the broken-engagement/romantic-history and the bookshop foreclosure
    (answers given contradicted hidden facts). The final story executed the festival-as-last-chance
    and shop-revival beats and the 20-year return, but omitted the mother’s early
    dementia and the ex-fiancé’s status as mayor/unmarried. Writing was coherent and
    engaging.
