  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: '**The Forge of the Forgotten**


    The hammer struck true, ringing through the smithy like a bell of defiance. Elias
    wiped the soot from his brow, his muscles burning as he shaped the iron into a
    plowshare. Master Harkin, his grizzled mentor, grunted in approval from his stool.
    "Aye, lad. You’ve got the touch. One day, you’ll be the finest smith in Eldermere."


    Elias smiled, but his eyes flickered to the window, where the sky had darkened
    unnaturally for weeks. The villagers whispered of the *Blight*—a creeping shadow
    that swallowed crops, twisted livestock, and left men hollow-eyed and silent.
    Worst of all, it had taken his sister, Liora. She had ventured too close to the
    Blackwood, where the Blight festered, and returned with her skin ashen, her voice
    a whisper. Now she lay abed, her breath shallow, her fingers curling like dead
    leaves.


    That night, as Elias banked the forge’s coals, Master Harkin placed a calloused
    hand on his shoulder. "The king’s men came today. They’re conscripting smiths
    to forge weapons. The Blight’s spreading faster than they thought."


    Elias’s stomach twisted. "And Liora?"


    Harkin’s grip tightened. "The healers say she’s beyond their craft. But there’s
    an old tale—one the priests don’t like to tell. The Blight wasn’t always just
    a sickness. It was a *curse*, cast by a forgotten god. And the only thing that
    ever held it back was the *Heartforge*, a blade said to burn with the fire of
    the first dawn."


    Elias scoffed. "A myth. Like the rest of them."


    Harkin’s eyes gleamed in the firelight. "Maybe. But the king’s men aren’t looking
    for myths. They’re looking for *you*."


    ---


    The call to adventure came at dawn—a royal summons, sealed with wax. Elias was
    to journey to the capital, where the king’s smiths would forge weapons to fight
    the Blight. But as he packed his tools, Liora’s fever broke. She gasped, her eyes
    flying open, and seized his wrist with unnatural strength.


    *"Elias,"* she rasped, *"the forge isn’t just iron. It’s* **you**."* Her nails
    bit into his skin, and for a heartbeat, her irises burned like embers. Then she
    collapsed, her breath steady once more.


    Elias stared at his hand. Where she had touched him, his skin glowed faintly,
    like a coal beneath ash.


    ---


    The road to the capital was lined with refugees, their faces gaunt, their carts
    laden with what little they could save. Elias walked among them, his mind racing.
    *Magic?* He was a smith, not a sorcerer. But the heat in his veins wouldn’t fade.


    At the city gates, he was met by Captain Veyra, a woman with a scarred lip and
    a sword at her hip. "You’re the apprentice?" she sneered. "Harkin sent a *boy*?"


    Elias bristled. "I can forge a blade as well as any man here."


    Veyra’s laugh was sharp. "We don’t need blades. We need *miracles*." She led him
    to the royal armory, where a dozen smiths labored over a massive anvil. At its
    center lay a shard of black metal, humming with a sound like distant thunder.


    "The last fragment of the Heartforge," Veyra said. "The priests say it’s cursed.
    The king says it’s our only hope."


    Elias reached out—and the moment his fingers brushed the shard, fire erupted from
    his palm. The smiths cried out, stumbling back, but Elias barely felt the heat.
    The shard *sang* to him, a chorus of hammers and hearths, of a power long buried
    in his blood.


    *"You are the last of the Emberborn,"* a voice whispered in his mind. *"The forge’s
    true heir."*


    ---


    The ordeal came that night.


    The Blight struck the city like a storm. Shadows slithered through the streets,
    coiling around the legs of fleeing soldiers, dragging them into the dark. Elias
    stood in the armory, the half-forged Heartforge clutched in his hands, its edge
    glowing like a star. But the metal resisted him. It demanded *more* than skill—it
    demanded *sacrifice*.


    Liora’s face flashed in his mind. Her laughter. The way she used to braid his
    hair when he was small. The forge had been his dream, his identity. But if he
    hesitated, the Blight would take everything.


    Gritting his teeth, Elias pressed his palm to the blade—and *pushed*. Not his
    strength, not his skill, but the fire in his veins, the magic he had never known
    he carried. The Heartforge flared white-hot, searing his flesh. He screamed as
    the skin blackened, as the bone beneath groaned—but the blade *mended*, its edge
    sharpening into a light so bright it cut through the dark.


    The Blight recoiled. The shadows shrieked, dissolving like mist in the sun.


    ---


    Dawn found Elias kneeling in the ruins of the armory, his right hand a twisted
    claw of scar tissue. The Heartforge lay before him, its light dimmed but unbroken.
    Captain Veyra approached, her face pale. "You did it," she breathed. "The Blight—it’s
    retreating."


    Elias didn’t answer. He couldn’t. The pain was a living thing, gnawing at his
    bones. But when he looked at his hand, he saw something worse than the scars:
    the forge’s fire was gone. The heat in his veins had faded. He was just a boy
    again. Just a smith.


    Or so he thought.


    As the healers tended to him, a familiar voice cut through the murmur of the crowd.
    "Elias?"


    He turned.


    Liora stood there, her skin flushed with color, her eyes clear. She rushed to
    him, throwing her arms around his neck. "You came back," she whispered.


    Elias held her tightly, his throat tight. He had lost his gift. His hand. But
    as Liora pulled away, smiling, he realized the truth:


    The forge had never been in his hands.


    It had been in his *blood*.


    And blood could not be taken. Only given.


    The Heartforge hummed at his feet, waiting.


    The journey was far from over.'
