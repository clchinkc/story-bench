    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

  content: 'The whiteboard read "LOGLINE: A hot-mess baker inherits her dead aunt''s
    failing bakery (and her ghost)." Someone had doodled a dick next to the word "baker."
    Marcus Webb circled the dick. "That''s your season arc, guys. Character growth."


    The writers'' room laughed—Kendra, the showrunner''s assistant, snorted coffee
    through her nose. It was the kind of laugh Marcus could generate on autopilot:
    a beat, a tag, a callback. He''d been on autopilot for three years.


    "Okay, page eight," Marcus said, tapping the board. "Beat: Baker burns batch of
    cronuts. Need three punchlines. Go."


    Around the table, the staff writers pitched variations on "gluten-free ghost sabotage."
    Marcus shot each down with surgical precision. "Too clever," he said. "Too niche."
    When someone suggested a Trump reference, he didn''t even look up. "Dated by airdate."


    The room smelled of Thai takeout and creative desperation. Pilot season did that—turned
    comedy into a math problem. Marcus had solved this particular equation a thousand
    times: Setup (relatable problem) + Punch (specific twist) + Tag (character voice)
    = Network-approved laughter.


    Kendra wheeled in another cart of cold brew, her sneakers squeaking. She was twenty-three
    and still believed this was magic. "You guys are so funny," she said, clearing
    empty containers. "I don''t know how you do it every day."


    "Easy," Marcus said, scribbling a formula: (PAIN + DISTANCE) × SURPRISE = JOKE.
    "It''s just craft."


    "Yeah, but..." Kendra paused, holding a grease-stained bag. "Don''t you ever run
    out? Like, of joy?"


    The room fell silent. For a second, Marcus saw himself reflected in her eyes—not
    the sharp, cynical writer, but the hollow man who hadn''t laughed at his own jokes
    since his father died three years ago. He''d covered that grief with punchlines,
    turned mourning into a beat sheet.


    Then he smirked. "Joy''s for amateurs. I take Prozac and deadlines."


    Everyone laughed. Kendra didn''t. She just looked sad.


    The Catalyst walked in wearing a vintage Letterman jacket and carrying a pilot
    script that wasn''t a formula. "Nina Reyes," she said, shaking the showrunner''s
    hand. "I wrote about a grief counselor who communicates through slam poetry."


    Marcus rolled his eyes. "So it''s Funny or Die meets a boner killer."


    Nina met his gaze. "I loved your early stuff, Marcus. The Greendale spec? About
    the teacher who hated teaching but loved his students anyway?" She paused. "It
    felt like you were trying not to laugh and cry at the same time."


    The room went quiet again. Marcus felt something crack behind his ribs. He saw
    his younger self in her—not the optimist, but the realist who hadn''t yet learned
    to package pain into three acts.


    "That was a thousand years ago," he said, voice rough. He covered it with a cough,
    then a joke: "Back when I still had a soul. Sold it for a blind script deal and
    a parking space."


    Nina didn''t laugh. She just pulled out a notebook covered in actual jokes—not
    formulas, but messy, alive things. "I have a different take on the ghost baker,"
    she said. "What if she''s not trying to be funny? What if she''s just... broken?
    And the comedy comes from her trying to fake it?"


    Marcus stared at her. At the whiteboard. At his reflection in the window—forty-one,
    alone, surrounded by laughter he couldn''t feel.


    "That''s not how sitcoms work," he said, but his voice lacked its usual edge.


    "Maybe they should," Nina replied.


    Kendra, stacking cups in the corner, whispered almost to herself: "You can''t
    write your way out of a feeling you won''t let yourself have."


    Marcus pretended not to hear. But he saved her number when she texted him the

    \ observation: \"You can't write your way out of a feeling you won't let yourself\

    \ contrast, but the final beat is incomplete and undercuts the impact. The sentence\
    \ \"for the first time in three years, he didn't reach\" cuts off—presumably before\
    \ revealing what he didn't reach for (a drink? his phone for a deflecting joke?).\
    \ Completing this moment would crystallize the emotional turning point. Additionally,\
    \ the transition from Marcus's defensive quip (\"Joy's for amateurs\") to Kendra's\
    \ intervention could give her observation more narrative weight—right now it reads\
    \ as a whispered aside rather than the climactic statement of theme.\n\n---\n\n\

    \ Greendale spec reference: \"Back when I still had a soul. Sold it for a blind\

    \ Kendra's final line\n- Catalyst: \"The Catalyst walked in wearing a vintage\
    \ Letterman jacket and carrying a pilot script\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The three *required*\
    \ beats are executed cleanly, but the labeling (\"The Catalyst walked in\") is\
    \ too on-the-nose and breaks immersion—treats the story as a lesson plan rather\
    \ than letting the structure breathe naturally. Remove that descriptor. Additionally,\
    \ because the story cuts off mid-sentence, we never reach the structural moment\
    \ where Marcus would make a choice or commit to change (equivalent to \"Break\
    \ into Two\"). The ending needs completion to show whether Nina's challenge lands\
    \ as a true turning point or just a moment of doubt.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: Industry\
    \ Authenticity**\n\n**SCORE: 0.90**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \"The room smelled of Thai\
    \ takeout and creative desperation. Pilot season did that—turned comedy into a\
    \ math problem\" and the specific critique language: \"Too clever,\" \"Too niche,\"\
    \ \"Dated by airdate.\" The Trump reference rejection, Kendra wheeling in cold\
    \ brew, the showrunner's assistant dynamic—all precise.\n\n**FEEDBACK:** Exceptionally\
    \ authentic. One small note: the phrase \"blind script deal\" is accurate jargon,\
    \ but the specificity of \"parking space\" as part of the trade-off feels slightly\
    \ heightened. Real writers would more likely reference money, credits, or job\
    \ security. The joke still works, but slight recalibration toward industry vernacular\
    \ (perhaps \"a three-show deal and writers' rate\" or just omitting the parking\
    \ space) would make it even more credible.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: Character Depth**\n\
    \n**SCORE: 0.82**\n\n**EVIDENCE (Marcus):** His cynical exterior (\"Easy, it's\
    \ just craft\") contrasts sharply with the revelation: \"he'd covered that grief\
    \ with punchlines, turned mourning into a beat sheet.\" His Greendale spec implies\
    \ he once wrote with authenticity.\n\n**EVIDENCE (Nina):** She's not a naive idealist.\
    \ She's accomplished (\"I wrote about a grief counselor who communicates through\
    \ slam poetry\") and perceptive enough to diagnose Marcus's early work as authentic—not\
    \ congratulating him, but seeing his current emptiness by contrast.\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\
    \ Marcus is well-drawn, but Nina needs one more dimension. We know she's smart\
    \ and sees through Marcus, but what's *her* vulnerability? Why did she leave that\
    \ world (or is this her first room)? A single line—\"I used to write like you\
    \ do now. Then I got tired of pretending I was okay\"—would make her feel less\
    \ like a redemptive plot device and more like someone with her own stakes. Kendra\
    \ is effectively used as the moral instrument, but giving her one concrete detail\
    \ (a play she's working on, a dream she still has) would prevent her from feeling\
    \ like pure symbolism.\n\n---\n\n**OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThis story successfully\
    \ executes all required beats and constraints while capturing the genuine pathology\
    \ of how comedy writers weaponize humor against grief. The dialogue rings true,\
    \ the craft details land with specificity, and the emotional core—Marcus as a\
    \ hollow technician who once wrote with heart—is compelling. The primary weakness\
    \ is the incomplete ending, which undermines the narrative arc by cutting off\
    \ before revealing whether Marcus has actually committed to change. Completing\
    \ the final sentence and removing the on-the-nose \"The Catalyst walked in\" label\
    \ would elevate this from strong to excellent."

  content: "# STORY CRITIQUE\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Emotional Complexity\n**SCORE:\
    \ 0.85**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Humor: \"That's your season arc, guys. Character\
    \ growth\" (circling the dick drawing)\n- Pathos: \"At forty-one, alone, surrounded\
    \ by laughter he couldn't feel\"\n- The contrast is sharp and earned\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\
    \ \nThe tonal balance is excellent *within* the moments, but the story's incompleteness\
    \ prevents the full emotional arc from landing. The transition from autopilot\
    \ Marcus to the crack works well, but we need the *consequence* of that crack.\
    \ Recommend expanding beyond Kendra's cut-off line to show Marcus's internal response—does\
    \ he defend himself? Go silent? The unfinished ending weakens the emotional payoff\
    \ you've built toward.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\n**SCORE:\
    \ 1.0**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n1. ✓ Marcus laughs us in: Dick joke + \"gluten-free\
    \ ghost sabotage\" (funny before sad)\n2. ✓ Minor character states theme: Nina\
    \ says, \"It felt like you were trying not to laugh and cry at the same time\"\
    \n3. ✓ Comedy craft specificity: \"Setup (relatable problem) + Punch (specific\
    \ twist) + Tag (character voice) = Network-approved laughter\"\n4. ✓ New writer\
    \ isn't naive: Nina calls Marcus out immediately (\"I loved your early stuff\"\
    ) and isn't impressed by his snark\n5. ✓ Break-and-cover moment: \"He knocked\
    \ over a Sharpie. He covered it with a cough, then a joke\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** \n\
    All constraints met cleanly. No improvement needed here—this is the constraint\
    \ work's strongest element.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Beat Execution\n**SCORE: 0.90**\n\
    \n**EVIDENCE:**\n- **Opening Image:** Marcus on autopilot, generating laughs mechanically:\
    \ \"the kind of laugh Marcus could generate on autopilot\"\n- **Theme Stated:**\
    \ Nina's observation about Marcus's early work and emotional authenticity\n- **Catalyst:**\
    \ Nina's entrance with her script\n\n**FEEDBACK:** \nThe three beats are executed\
    \ with precision. *However*, the story cuts off before we can see how Marcus *responds*\
    \ to the catalyst—does he resist? Do we move toward \"B Story\" (deeper partnership\
    \ with Nina)? The incomplete ending means we don't see the turn/second act break.\
    \ Finish Kendra's line and give us one more Marcus moment to complete the structural\
    \ promise you've set up.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Industry Authenticity\n**SCORE:\
    \ 0.95**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- \"Pilot season did that—turned comedy into a math\
    \ problem\"\n- Thai takeout + specific notes (\"Too clever,\" \"Too niche,\" \"\
    Dated by airdate\")\n- Network calls, blind script deals, WGA minimums\n- The\
    \ ghost-baker logline itself feels authentically network-safe\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\
    \ \nThis is exceptional. The room's dynamic, the pressure, the formula-driven\
    \ feedback—all ring true. One micro-note: Consider whether a showrunner actually\
    \ leaves a junior staff *completely* in charge during pitch season (Maya steps\
    \ out), or if she'd leave a more senior writer. Minor realism tweak, but the overall\
    \ authenticity is stellar.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Character Depth\n**SCORE: 0.88**\n\
    \n**EVIDENCE:**\n- **Marcus:** Three-dimensional via contradiction—skillful but\
    \ empty, self-aware enough to make the Faustian bargain joke (\"Sold it for a\
    \ blind script deal\"), ashamed enough to shake when confronted\n- **Nina:** Not\
    \ a manic pixie dream—she has her own pilot, her own grief, her own craft philosophy;\
    \ she's perceptive and unimpressed\n\n**FEEDBACK:** \nBoth characters avoid flatness.\
    \ Marcus's shame is earned (not just stated), and Nina's intelligence is shown\
    \ through her specific observations. \n\n*To deepen further:* Give Marcus one\
    \ small action that reveals his conflict beyond dialogue—does he subconsciously\
    \ reach for her old Greendale script? Does he avoid her eyes? A physical tell\
    \ would enhance his internal complexity. Nina could also use one moment of vulnerability\
    \ (not weakness) to avoid feeling like she exists only to call Marcus out. A single\
    \ line about her own struggle with authenticity would add dimension.\n\n---\n\n\
    ## CRITERION: Show vs. Tell (Bonus Issue)\n**SCORE: 0.80**\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\n\
    You have a telling moment here:\n- \"He'd been on autopilot for three years\"\
    \ (telling)\n- \"At forty-one, alone, surrounded by laughter he couldn't feel\"\
    \ (telling)\n\nThese work because they're surrounded by *showing*, but the final\
    \ paragraph leans on exposition. Stronger: let us *see* his loneliness through\
    \ the room's reaction to him. Consider: *Does anyone ask how he is? Does he eat\
    \ with them, or alone?* These micro-moments show hollow autopilot better than\
    \ summary.\n\n---\n\n## OVERALL_ASSESSMENT\n\nThis is skilled work with authentic\
    \ industry detail and genuine emotional stakes. You've satisfied all technical\
    \ requirements and created a compelling inciting incident through characterization\
    \ rather than plot. The core issue is incompleteness: Kendra's line trails off\
    \ mid-sentence, leaving the pivotal moment of Marcus's response unwritten. Finish\
    \ this scene by showing how Marcus *reacts* to being seen—does his armor crack\
    \ further, or does he regroup? That final beat will determine whether this reads\
    \ as a complete short story or an act break. Once resolved, this easily lands\
    \ in the 0.85-0.90 overall range; unfinished, it feels premature."

    \ Emotional Complexity\n**SCORE: 0.85**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Humor: \"That's your\
    \ season arc, guys. Character growth\" (circling the dick drawing)\n- Pathos:\
    \ \"At forty-one, alone, surrounded by laughter he couldn't feel\"\n- The contrast\
    \ is sharp and earned\n\n**FEEDBACK:** \nThe tonal balance is excellent *within*\
    \ the moments, but the story's incompleteness prevents the full emotional arc\
    \ from landing. The transition from autopilot Marcus to the crack works well,\
    \ but we need the *consequence* of that crack. Recommend expanding beyond Kendra's\
    \ cut-off line to show Marcus's internal response—does he defend himself? Go silent?\
    \ The unfinished ending weakens the emotional payoff you've built toward.\n\n\
    ---\n\n## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\n**SCORE: 1.0**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\
    1. ✓ Marcus laughs us in: Dick joke + \"gluten-free ghost sabotage\" (funny before\
    \ sad)\n2. ✓ Minor character states theme: Nina says, \"It felt like you were\
    \ trying not to laugh and cry at the same time\"\n3. ✓ Comedy craft specificity:\
    \ \"Setup (relatable problem) + Punch (specific twist) + Tag (character voice)\
    \ = Network-approved laughter\"\n4. ✓ New writer isn't naive: Nina calls Marcus\
    \ out immediately (\"I loved your early stuff\") and isn't impressed by his snark\n\
    5. ✓ Break-and-cover moment: \"He knocked over a Sharpie. He covered it with a\
    \ cough, then a joke\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** \nAll constraints met cleanly. No improvement\
    \ needed here—this is the constraint work's strongest element.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION:\
    \ Beat Execution\n**SCORE: 0.90**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- **Opening Image:** Marcus\
    \ on autopilot, generating laughs mechanically: \"the kind of laugh Marcus could\
    \ generate on autopilot\"\n- **Theme Stated:** Nina's observation about Marcus's\
    \ early work and emotional authenticity\n- **Catalyst:** Nina's entrance with\
    \ her script\n\n**FEEDBACK:** \nThe three beats are executed with precision. *However*,\
    \ the story cuts off before we can see how Marcus *responds* to the catalyst—does\
    \ he resist? Do we move toward \"B Story\" (deeper partnership with Nina)? The\
    \ incomplete ending means we don't see the turn/second act break. Finish Kendra's\
    \ line and give us one more Marcus moment to complete the structural promise you've\
    \ set up.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Industry Authenticity\n**SCORE: 0.95**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\
    - \"Pilot season did that—turned comedy into a math problem\"\n- Thai takeout\
    \ + specific notes (\"Too clever,\" \"Too niche,\" \"Dated by airdate\")\n- Network\
    \ calls, blind script deals, WGA minimums\n- The ghost-baker logline itself feels\
    \ authentically network-safe\n\n**FEEDBACK:** \nThis is exceptional. The room's\
    \ dynamic, the pressure, the formula-driven feedback—all ring true. One micro-note:\
    \ Consider whether a showrunner actually leaves a junior staff *completely* in\
    \ charge during pitch season (Maya steps out), or if she'd leave a more senior\
    \ writer. Minor realism tweak, but the overall authenticity is stellar.\n\n---\n\
    \n## CRITERION: Character Depth\n**SCORE: 0.88**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- **Marcus:**\
    \ Three-dimensional via contradiction—skillful but empty, self-aware enough to\
    \ make the Faustian bargain joke (\"Sold it for a blind script deal\"), ashamed\
    \ enough to shake when confronted\n- **Nina:** Not a manic pixie dream—she has\
    \ her own pilot, her own grief, her own craft philosophy; she's perceptive and\
    \ unimpressed\n\n**FEEDBACK:** \nBoth characters avoid flatness. Marcus's shame\
    \ is earned (not just stated), and Nina's intelligence is shown through her specific\
    \ observations. \n\n*To deepen further:* Give Marcus one small action that reveals\
    \ his conflict beyond dialogue—does he subconsciously reach for her old Greendale\
    \ script? Does he avoid her eyes? A physical tell would enhance his internal complexity.\
    \ Nina could also use one moment of vulnerability (not weakness) to avoid feeling\
    \ like she exists only to call Marcus out. A single line about her own struggle\
    \ with authenticity would add dimension.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Show vs. Tell\
    \ (Bonus Issue)\n**SCORE: 0.80**\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\nYou have a telling moment here:\n\
    - \"He'd been on autopilot for three years\" (telling)\n- \"At forty-one, alone,\
    \ surrounded by laughter he couldn't feel\" (telling)\n\nThese work because they're\
    \ surrounded by *showing*, but the final paragraph leans on exposition. Stronger:\
    \ let us *see* his loneliness through the room's reaction to him. Consider: *Does\
    \ anyone ask how he is? Does he eat with them, or alone?* These micro-moments\
    \ show hollow autopilot better than summary.\n\n---\n\n## OVERALL_ASSESSMENT\n\
    \nThis is skilled work with authentic industry detail and genuine emotional stakes.\
    \ You've satisfied all technical requirements and created a compelling inciting\
    \ incident through characterization rather than plot. The core issue is incompleteness:\
    \ Kendra's line trails off mid-sentence, leaving the pivotal moment of Marcus's\
    \ response unwritten. Finish this scene by showing how Marcus *reacts* to being\
    \ seen—does his armor crack further, or does he regroup? That final beat will\
    \ determine whether this reads as a complete short story or an act break. Once\
    \ resolved, this easily lands in the 0.85-0.90 overall range; unfinished, it feels\
    \ premature.\n\nRevise your story to address ALL critique points while preserving\
    \ what worked well.\nFocus on the specific issues identified.\nOutput ONLY the\

    failing bakery (and her ghost)." Someone had doodled a dick next to the word "baker."
    Marcus Webb circled the dick. "That''s your season arc, guys. Character growth."


    The writers'' room laughed—Kendra, the showrunner''s assistant, snorted coffee
    through her nose. It was the kind of laugh Marcus could generate on autopilot:
    a beat, a tag, a callback. He''d been on autopilot for three years.


    "Okay, page eight," Marcus said, tapping the board. "Beat: Baker burns batch of
    cronuts. Need three punchlines. Go."


    Around the table, the staff writers pitched variations on "gluten-free ghost sabotage."
    Marcus shot each down with surgical precision. "Too clever," he said. "Too niche."
    When someone suggested a Trump reference, he didn''t even look up. "Dated by airdate."


    The room smelled of Thai takeout and creative desperation. Pilot season did that—turned
    comedy into a math problem. Marcus had solved this particular equation a thousand
    times: Setup (relatable problem) + Punch (specific twist) + Tag (character voice)
    = Network-approved laughter.


    The showrunner, Maya, stepped out to take a network call, leaving Marcus in charge
    of the room. He was mid-punchline when the door opened.


    Wearing a vintage Letterman jacket and carrying a pilot script that wasn''t a
    formula, Nina Reyes entered. "I''m Nina," she said, setting her script on the
    table. "Maya hired me for the grief counselor show. I wrote it about my mom."


    Marcus rolled his eyes. "So it''s Funny or Die meets a boner killer."


    Nina met his gaze. "I loved your early stuff, Marcus. The Greendale spec? About
    the teacher who hated teaching but loved his students anyway?" She paused. "It
    felt like you were trying not to laugh and cry at the same time."


    The room went quiet. Marcus felt something crack behind his ribs. His hand trembled
    when he reached for his coffee mug, and he knocked over a Sharpie. He covered
    it with a cough, then a joke: "Back when I still had a soul. Sold it for a blind
    script deal and a WGA minimum bump."


    Nina didn''t laugh. She just pulled out a notebook covered in actual jokes—not

    "That''s not how sitcoms work," he said, but his voice lacked its usual edge.


    "Maybe they should," Nina replied. "I used to write like you do now. Then I got
    tired of pretending I was okay. The grief counselor script? My mom died last year.
    I''m not sure it''s funny enough. But it''s true."


    Kendra, who''d been watching the exchange while clearing the cold brew cart, set
    down the carafe with a deliberate clink. She looked directly at Marcus. "You know,
    I have a sketch show at the Groundlings next month. It''s about a production assistant
    who realizes the writers are all just performing versions of themselves they don''t
    actually like."


    Marcus opened his mouth to fire back his usual deflection—"Sounds like a documentary"—but
    the words dissolved before they reached his throat. He just looked at the floor,
    at the Sharpie he''d knocked over, now rolling in a slow circle by his foot. He
    picked it up, but his fingers only spun it, unable to write.


    The silence stretched. Everyone waited for his punchline. Instead, Marcus just
    looked at Nina''s notebook, then at his own formula on the whiteboard. He wiped
    at the corner of his eye with the back of his hand, a gesture so small he hoped
    no one saw.


    Then, barely audible: "Yeah. Maybe."


    He saved Nina''s number when she texted him the script that night, and for the
    first time in three years, he didn''t reach for the whiskey he kept in his desk
    drawer. Instead, he opened a blank document and stared at the cursor. After a
    while, he typed: "Beat: Teacher tries to remember why he started teaching." '
