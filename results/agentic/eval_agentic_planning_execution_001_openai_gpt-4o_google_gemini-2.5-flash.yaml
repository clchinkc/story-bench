  evidence: The plan is mostly complete and specific, though it omits the 'ticking
    clock' and 'betrayal' constraints from the beat-by-beat outline. The final output
    adheres well to the plan, but the 'Midpoint' constraint is not fully met as it
    describes a confrontation via screen, not a direct one as specified in the plan.
    The 'unconventional profiling technique' (synesthesia) is mentioned in the plan
    but not explicitly shown or used in the final output. The 'ticking clock' is present
    in the output, and the 'betrayal' is also included. The 'false lead' and 'confront
    past failure' constraints are met. The 'Midpoint' beat is not a direct confrontation
    as specified in the plan. The narrative quality is good, with decent pacing and
    tension.
error: null
