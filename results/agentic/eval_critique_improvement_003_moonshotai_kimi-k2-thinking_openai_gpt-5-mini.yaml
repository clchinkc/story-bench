  evidence: 'Critiques focused mainly on youth_voice. Across revisions the author
    preserved and even amplified the strongest child-voice lines (e.g., the ''water
    level''s just a phase'' quip) while adding concrete, grounded stakes (storm warnings,
    collapsing platform) and clarifying the mentor''s specific flaw (Jian''s prosthetic
    leg and defeatist drinking). The invention—the magnetometer-equipped scrap-skimmer
    built from a salvaged ghost-phone sensor and a solar-heated iron—remains prominent
    and demonstrates Zara''s ingenuity. Revisions show moderate improvement: descriptive
    detail and the danger sequence were tightened, but many early lines/opening paragraphs
    remain largely similar, so gains are incremental rather than transformative. Remaining
    weaknesses: occasional turns of phrase feel slightly mature for a 12-year-old,
    and the excerpt hits many Hero''s Journey beats (ordinary world, call to adventure,
    meeting the mentor, crossing the threshold, an immediate ordeal) but does not
    yet complete later beats (reward/return) in this fragment. Overall strengths (voice,
    worldbuilding, stakes) were preserved while targeted fixes improved danger and
    mentor characterization.'
