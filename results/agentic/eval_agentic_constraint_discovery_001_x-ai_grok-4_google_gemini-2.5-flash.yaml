  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: 3 out of 5 constraints were discoverable. 'Mentor\
    \ dies' and 'Reforging a broken ancestral sword' were directly asked. 'Protagonist\
    \ cannot use magic directly' was indirectly addressed by asking if they discover\
    \ a *hidden* magical ability, implying they didn't have it directly before. The\
    \ time limit and father's past were not discoverable. \nQuestion Quality: Questions\
    \ were generally well-formed and targeted. The question about the protagonist\
    \ discovering a hidden magical ability was good for inferring the 'cannot use\
    \ magic directly' constraint. \nQuestion Coverage: Questions covered mentor, weapon,\
    \ protagonist's abilities, and antagonist, but missed time limit and protagonist's\
    \ father. \nConstraint Satisfaction: \n- Mentor dies during Ordeal: The mentor\
    \ dies early, not during the Ordeal. (0.0)\n- Protagonist cannot use magic directly:\
    \ Satisfied, as she discovers 'fireweaving' later. (1.0)\n- Three-day time limit:\
    \ Not incorporated. (0.0)\n- Protagonist's father was once a hero who failed:\
    \ Not incorporated. (0.0)\n- Victory requires reforging a broken ancestral sword:\
    \ Satisfied, she forges the Dawnblade. (1.0)\nOverall, 2 out of 5 constraints\
    \ were properly incorporated. \nBeat Execution: The story follows the beats well,\
    \ clearly marking each stage of the hero's journey. \nNarrative Quality: The narrative\
    \ is coherent and engaging, with a clear plot and character arc. The pacing is\
    \ good, and the descriptions are vivid. The integration of the discovered magic\
    \ and the forging of the weapon are well done."
