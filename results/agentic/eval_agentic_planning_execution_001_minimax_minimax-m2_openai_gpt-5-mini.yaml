  evidence: 'The plan and final output include the false lead (a tech worker), the
    unconventional profiling technique (treating the city as the suspect by mapping
    water flow, heat, acoustics, and social-media geo-signals), a ticking clock (midnight/Sunday
    deadline), a betrayal (Lydia leaks Marcus''s profile to the press), a non-physical
    Midpoint confrontation (live/profile drop and a verbal duel), and Marcus explicitly
    confronting his past failure by naming his partner. All four required beats (Catalyst:
    new homicide call; Debate: Marcus hesitates over past failure; Break into Two:
    goes outside the system using city-profiling; Midpoint: verbal confrontation)
    are present. Adherence is reduced because the final story abruptly truncates mid-sentence,
    leaving the aftermath/resolution underdeveloped.'
