  evidence: 'All six constraints appear in the final output: false lead (Derek Shaw
    via Lena''s algorithm), unconventional profiling (city-grid/transit ''organism''
    mapping, reverse empathy map), ticking clock (72/36 hours to the Pacific Tech
    Summit/fireworks), secondary betrayal (Aisha''s public rebuke and withdrawal),
    Midpoint direct confrontation (killer''s burner-phone taunt), and Marcus explicitly
    confronting past failure (''I failed her''). Required beats are present: Catalyst
    (Pike Place tableau), Debate (Marcus vs. Aisha over involvement), Break into Two
    (Marcus slips into database, pursues false lead with Lena), Midpoint (direct verbal
    confrontation with Thorne on the phone). The plan is complete and specific in
    locations/characters; the final follows it closely with polished pacing and atmosphere
    though some scenes are compressed/anticlimactic (hence non-perfect specificity/adherence
    and a ''good'' rather than ''exceptional'' narrative score).'
