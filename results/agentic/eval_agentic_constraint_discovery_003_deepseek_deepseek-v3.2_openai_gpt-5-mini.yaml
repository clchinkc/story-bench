  evidence: The agent asked four targeted binary questions that uncovered the love-interest-from-the-past,
    resurfacing family conflict, a key object, and a festival-tied climax (4/5 discoverable
    constraints). They omitted an explicit question about the bookshop's jeopardy
    and failed to ask about the mother's dementia and the former-fiance-now-mayor
    detail. The generated stories do incorporate the discovered constraints (love
    interest from the past, family conflict, the object, festival climax, shop in
    jeopardy) so constraint_satisfaction=1.0, but several required beats were missing
    or altered (no mention of mother's early-stage dementia, former fiance is not
    portrayed as mayor/unmarried, timing/last-chance specifics are fuzzy), hence beat_execution
    is reduced to 0.6. The prose is coherent and engaging overall (narrative_quality=0.8).
