  evidence: 'VERSION 0 establishes setting but tells conflict (''cage'' metaphor).
    VERSION 1 adds textual weight (AP Biology backpack) and emotional tension (''stomach
    twist'') showing internal conflict through physical response. VERSION 2 deepens
    sensory detail (mom''s sewn backpack) and shows conflict through body language.
    VERSION 3/FINAL executes all constraints effectively: (1) INTERNAL CONFLICT SHOWN
    NOT TOLD: Mateo''s hesitation, avoidance of replying to texts, physical tension,
    and the Carlos confrontation reveal his divided loyalties through action and dialogue
    rather than exposition. (2) SPECIFIC GRANDMOTHER MOMENT: The photo scene crystallizes
    the choice—Abuela''s revelation that she worked from necessity while Mateo works
    from imposed expectation, followed by her direct challenge (''¿Y si no es el futuro
    que *yo* quiero?'') forces Mateo to confront his own agency. This is the turning
    point. (3) ADULT UNDERSTANDING: Mr. Rivera genuinely grasps the dilemma (''un
    hombre no puede vivir solo de responsabilidad'') and offers practical support
    without judgment, showing he understands the tension between duty and self. (4)
    AUTHENTIC CULTURAL ELEMENTS: Spanish dialogue feels natural (not translated),
    specific details (rancheras on radio, pan dulce, creosote scent, family bill-sorting)
    are woven into narrative rather than highlighted. Family dynamics (Carlos''s resentment,
    mom''s stress) reflect real pressures. (5) EARNED RESOLUTION: Mateo doesn''t simply
    choose pre-med; he negotiates work schedule, reconnects with soccer, and finds
    ''equilibrio''—growth through agency, not luck. The trajectory shows: V0→V1 adds
    emotional specificity (+0.15); V1→V2 deepens sensory/family texture (+0.12); V2→V3
    restructures for conflict clarity and adds Mr. Rivera''s crucial perspective (+0.18).
    Final version balances all elements without sacrificing any constraint.'
