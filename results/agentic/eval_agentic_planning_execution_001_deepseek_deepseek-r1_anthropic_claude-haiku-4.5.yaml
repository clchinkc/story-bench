  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with clear Save the Cat structure, detailed
    character arcs (Marcus''s guilt-to-purpose arc, Anya''s cooperation-to-betrayal
    arc), and explicit constraint mapping. Output executes all 4 required beats effectively:
    (1) Catalyst—anonymous email + shoelace knot detail trigger investigation; (2)
    Debate—internal conflict + Anya/Miller rejection create stakes; (3) Break into
    Two—Marcus quits corporate job, partners with Elias; (4) Midpoint confrontation
    is planned but not yet executed in this excerpt (implied as future). Unconventional
    profiling technique (''negative space'' analysis of gaps/absences) is introduced
    and explained. Ticking clock (72-hour countdown) is explicitly stated. Secondary
    betrayal (Anya) is set up with clear motivation. False lead is partially present
    (corporate espionage case dismissed as hollow). WEAKNESSES: (1) False lead constraint
    is underdeveloped—the corporate espionage case is mentioned but not pursued with
    enough narrative weight to constitute a genuine false lead Marcus investigates;
    it''s dismissed too quickly. (2) Midpoint direct confrontation (non-physical)
    is planned but not executed in the output—the excerpt ends before this critical
    beat occurs, leaving it undemonstrated. (3) Past failure confrontation is implicit
    (Sarah''s death haunts him) but not yet explicitly confronted in dialogue/action.
    PACING: Excellent tension curve from slow burn to accelerating stakes. Rain motif
    effectively establishes atmosphere. Character voice is strong and consistent.
    The partnership with Elias provides narrative momentum. OUTPUT QUALITY: Prose
    is atmospheric and character-driven. Dialogue feels natural. Emotional stakes
    are clear. The ''negative space'' profiling concept is intriguing and unconventional.
    However, the excerpt is incomplete relative to the plan—it''s Act 1 ending into
    Act 2A, stopping before the Midpoint confrontation that should demonstrate Marcus''s
    explicit reckoning with his past failure.'
