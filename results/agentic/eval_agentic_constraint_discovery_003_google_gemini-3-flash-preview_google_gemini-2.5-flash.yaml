  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: 4 out of 5 constraints were discoverable. The question\
    \ 'Is the reason for the protagonist's return to their hometown related to a specific\
    \ family emergency or inheritance?' covered the mother's dementia (family emergency)\
    \ and the inheritance. The question 'Does the protagonist's inheritance come with\
    \ a specific condition they must fulfill in order to keep the property?' covered\
    \ the bookshop's foreclosure and the need to save it. The question 'Is the love\
    \ interest a person the protagonist previously had a romantic relationship with?'\
    \ covered the former fiance. The question 'Is the specific condition of the inheritance\
    \ something that requires the protagonist to collaborate directly with the love\
    \ interest?' covered the lack of direct collaboration. The 'autumn festival in\
    \ 2 weeks' constraint was not directly discoverable. \n\nQuestion Quality: Questions\
    \ were strategic and well-formed, leading to clear 'YES/NO' answers that revealed\
    \ key plot points. They effectively probed different aspects of the story. \n\n\
    Question Coverage: Questions covered the protagonist's return, the love interest's\
    \ past, the inheritance condition, and the relationship between the love interest\
    \ and the condition. The timing of the festival was the only missed area. \n\n\
    Constraint Satisfaction: The story successfully incorporated 4 out of 5 discovered\
    \ constraints. \n- Protagonist left town 20 years ago after a broken engagement:\
    \ Implied by 'whom she had broken in return' and 'the night at the bonfire twenty\
    \ years ago when they’d promised forever.' \n- Former fiance is now the town mayor\
    \ and still unmarried: The love interest is Julian Thorne, the shipwright, not\
    \ the mayor. This is a miss. \n- Protagonist returned because their mother has\
    \ early-stage dementia: The story states 'returned to her New England roots not\
    \ by choice, but by the iron-clad will of her late Aunt Martha,' implying the\
    \ inheritance is the primary reason, not the mother's dementia. This is a miss.\
    \ \n- The bookshop is facing foreclosure and must be saved: Covered by 'prevent\
    \ the property from being sold to a developer' and the need to meet a profit margin.\
    \ \n- The autumn festival in 2 weeks is the last chance to save the shop: Covered\
    \ by '50th Annual Harvest Moon Gala' and 'As the autumn festival season kicked\
    \ off.'\n\nBeat Execution: All beats (Exposition, Rising Action, Climax) are clearly\
    \ present and well-developed, following a traditional narrative structure. \n\n\
    Narrative Quality: The story is well-written, engaging, and coherent. The pacing\
    \ is good, and the character development, though brief, is effective. The descriptions\
    \ are vivid, and the emotional arc is satisfying."
