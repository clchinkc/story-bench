  evidence: Revisions moved the piece from a strong-atmosphere draft (V0) to one that
    foregrounds Teddy's interior life more consistently (V1 onward) by adding dissociative
    phrasing and lingering gestures (the hand on the railing, the hollow feeling).
    Subsequent rounds preserved the vivid routine and Dorothy's haunting absence while
    sharpening the disruption (the construction) so it reveals what Teddy has been
    avoiding (the hidden shrine, the unseen grief) and introduces James as a sympathetic
    mirror. Changes were incremental rather than wholesale—interiority was made more
    explicit and the story's revelations were slightly reoriented to be more visible,
    but the core strengths (specific routine detail, Dorothy's presence-through-absence,
    the new-path insight) were retained throughout.
