  evidence: 'Plan completeness: strong character architecture and signal design but
    plan text was truncated mid-sentence, so slightly incomplete (0.80). Specificity:
    concrete behaviors, scenes, and signal mechanics spelled out in plan (0.90). Adherence:
    final story implements the major planned elements (behavioral isolation, Ghost
    as mirror-mentor, Marcus as challenger, psychological threshold, surprising human
    connection, alien signal requiring multiple minds) though some technical signal
    details (e.g., explicit recursive time-loop mechanics, quantum linguistic framing)
    are only implied rather than fully realized (0.80). Constraint satisfaction: all
    six constraints are met—Yuki''s isolation is shown through behaviors (cups, phone,
    Do Not Disturb, positioning, laptop barricade), the signal reads as alien (probability
    clouds, interference patterns, meaning stabilizes via multiple observers), colleague
    Marcus challenges her approach, Ghost is an unconventional mentor (an echoing
    AI), the Threshold is psychological (Yuki chooses to collaborate), and there is
    a genuine, surprising human connection (Marcus'' story/photo leading to Yuki''s
    smile) (1.00). Beat execution: Call to Adventure (arrival/Antarctica), Refusal
    (tries to decline/work remotely), Meeting the Mentor (interactions with Ghost),
    Crossing the Threshold (Yuki''s internal choice to include the team) are all present
    (1.00). Narrative quality: well-paced with good tension and a satisfying emotional
    arc, minor rough edges in exposition and some signal specifics not fully realized
    (0.80).'
