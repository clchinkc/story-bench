  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with detailed Save the Cat structure.
    All 4 required beats present: Catalyst (body discovery), Debate (Christine/Walter
    conversations), Break into Two (false lead with Thomas Wright), Midpoint (basement
    confrontation with non-physical dialogue). Unconventional profiling technique
    well-established (city geography/hidden spaces mapping). Ticking clock element
    strong (48-hour countdown, 72-hour expiration). Past failure explicitly confronted
    (Elena''s death, Marcus''s guilt). Secondary betrayal present (Ray O''Donnell
    feeding press, FBI removing Marcus). False lead effectively executed (Thomas Wright
    misdirection). Output follows plan closely with vivid prose and strong pacing.
    WEAKNESSES: Constraint #5 (secondary character betrayal) is somewhat underdeveloped—Ray
    O''Donnell mentioned but never directly confronts Marcus; betrayal feels more
    institutional than personal. The betrayal lacks emotional weight compared to other
    elements. Midpoint confrontation, while dialogue-based, could have more psychological
    tension/stakes clarity. Some plot mechanics feel slightly rushed in final act
    (Rainmaker''s motivation reveal could be deeper). Minor: Walter''s final role
    is supportive rather than conflicted, reducing dramatic tension. EXECUTION: Narrative
    quality is strong with atmospheric writing, good pacing, and emotional resonance.
    Character arc for Marcus is clear and earned. The twist that Rainmaker mirrors
    Marcus''s obsession is psychologically sound. Ending provides closure while maintaining
    ambiguity about Marcus''s recovery.'
