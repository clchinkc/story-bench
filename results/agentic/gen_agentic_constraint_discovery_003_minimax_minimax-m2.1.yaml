  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

    The salt air smelled of seaweed and woodsmoke, carrying the unmistakable perfume
    of autumn in Pemberton Cove. Eleanor Chen stood on the cracked sidewalk in front
    of her mother''s house, suitcase in hand, watching the first red leaves skitter
    across the street like restless spirits.


    She''d been away for sixteen years. Sixteen years of building a life in Boston—a
    cramped but beloved bookshop called Chapter & Verse, a small apartment above it,
    and an existence so carefully constructed that nothing could touch her. Nothing
    could remind her of the girl she''d been here, the one who''d loved recklessly
    and left without looking back.


    The estate attorney had called three weeks ago. Cancer. Quick and merciless. The
    house was hers now, and the paperwork required her presence. That was the official
    reason she''d returned.


    The real reason waited somewhere in this town, and Eleanor wasn''t ready to name
    it.


    The Autumn Harvest Festival had transformed Pemberton Cove into a postcard. Paper
    lanterns swung between lampposts, and the smell of mulled cider drifted from the
    square. Eleanor walked through the crowds, keeping her head down, but familiar
    faces caught her at every turn. The woman from the bakery who used to give her
    free cookies. The retired fisherman who taught her to tie knots. They looked at
    her with something between curiosity and quiet judgment, and Eleanor felt every
    mile of her absence like a physical weight.


    She was checking her phone when she heard it—that laugh. Low and warm, carving
    through sixteen years like it was nothing.


    Marcus Okonkwo stood by the cider stand, taller than she remembered, silver threading
    through his close-cropped hair, still wearing that crooked smile that had once
    made her feel like the most important person in any room. He was talking to someone,
    gesturing animatedly, and then his eyes found hers across the crowd.


    The years between them collapsed.


    Eleanor wanted to run. Every instinct screamed at her to retreat to the hotel,
    pack her bags, and disappear back to Boston where the past couldn''t follow. But
    her feet wouldn''t move, and Marcus was already walking toward her, his expression
    shifting from surprise to something she couldn''t read.


    "Eleanor Chen," he said. Her name in his voice sounded like a question and an
    accusation all at once. "After all this time."


    "Marcus." Her voice barely steadied. "I didn''t know you were in town."


    "My father''s still here. He had a stroke last month." He watched her face change.
    "You didn''t know."


    How could she? She''d cut every thread that connected her to this place, including
    the ones that led to him. The night before she left for college, they''d made
    love in this very house, her mother''s generosity stretching just far enough to
    give them privacy. He''d whispered promises she couldn''t let herself believe.
    She''d whispered nothing at all, and by morning, she''d vanished without a goodbye.


    Sixteen years of silence. Sixteen years of convincing herself that leaving was
    the kindest thing she could do for him—that she was holding him back, that he''d
    thank her someday. Sixteen years of watching every relationship fail because she
    couldn''t give anyone the parts of herself she''d left here, buried in the arms
    of a boy who''d deserved so much better.


    "I didn''t know about your father," she finally said. "I''m sorry."


    "He''ll recover. The festival''s been good for him—keeps him busy." A pause. "I''m
    here for the whole month. Opening a branch of my architecture firm in Portland,
    but I wanted to be here for the festivities."


    Eleanor nodded, her mind racing. A month. A whole month in this town, running
    into each other at the grocery store, the post office, everywhere. The distance
    she''d built was suddenly very small.


    "I owe you an explanation," she said quietly. "I know I can''t undo—"


    "Do you?" His voice wasn''t cruel, but it wasn''t kind either. "Do you know what
    you owe me, Eleanor?"


    She looked at him then, really looked, and saw not anger in his eyes but something
    more dangerous: hope that had survived against every odds.


    "The question," Marcus said, stepping closer, "is whether you''re finally ready
    to stay long enough to give one."'
