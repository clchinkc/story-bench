    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

  content: "The whiteboard in Room 4B was a graveyard of \"alt\" jokes and discarded\
    \ \"B-plots.\" Marcus Webb leaned back in his ergonomic chair, which cost more\
    \ than his first car and felt like a throne of lies.\n\n“Okay, the protagonist’s\
    \ wife finds the hidden cigar box,” Marcus said, spinning a dry-erase marker like\
    \ a prop. “We need a button. If she gets mad, it’s a procedural. If she lights\
    \ one up, it’s a mid-life crisis. But if she finds out he’s been using the box\
    \ to store his toenail clippings, it’s a Tuesday night on CBS.”\n\nThe room erupted.\
    \ Even the showrunner, a man who hadn't smiled since the 2007 strike, gave a sharp\
    \ bark of laughter. Marcus didn't join them. He simply checked his watch, calculating\
    \ how many more \"beats\" he had to manufacture before he could go home to his\
    \ silent apartment and eat cereal over the sink.\n\n“God, Marcus,” Jerry, a staff\
    \ writer who had survived three heart attacks and four divorces, wheezed as he\
    \ wiped his eyes. “You’re a surgeon with the cynicism. But you know, kid, comedy\
    \ isn't just about the punchline. It’s the truth people are too scared to say\
    \ out loud.”\n\nMarcus didn't blink. “Truth doesn't syndidate, Jerry. Math does.”\n\
    \nThe door opened, and the Catalyst walked in. Maya wasn't the wide-eyed ingenue\
    \ Marcus expected. She wore a faded *Kids in the Hall* t-shirt and carried a notebook\
    \ that looked like it had been through a war.\n\n“Everyone, this is Chloe,” the\
    \ showrunner announced. \n\n“Maya,” she corrected instantly, her voice steady.\n\
    \n“Right. Maya. She’s our new junior. Marcus, show her the ropes. Make sure she\
    \ doesn't try to put any 'heart' into the script. We’re aiming for 'cynical but\
    \ digestible.'”\n\nBy 3:00 PM, the room was a haze of lukewarm espresso and the\
    \ smell of Thai takeout. Marcus was dissecting a scene with the clinical precision\
    \ of a coroner.\n\n“You’re doing it wrong,” Maya said. It was the first time she’d\
    \ spoken.\n\nThe room went silent. Marcus looked up from the beat sheet. “Excuse\
    \ me?”\n\n“The reversal in Scene C,” she said, pointing at the board. “You’re\
    \ using a 'rule of three' to bury the fact that the character is lonely. You’re\
    \ hiding the character behind the joke.”\n\n“That’s the job, Maya,” Marcus said,\
    \ his voice dropping into a low, dangerous register. “We build the armor. If the\
    \ audience is laughing, they can’t see the ribs breaking underneath. It’s a defense\
    \ mechanism that pays for a Tesla.”\n\n“Is that why you haven't looked at the\
    \ script once today?” she asked. She stepped closer, her eyes scanning the board,\
    \ then landing on him. “You’re not writing comedy, Marcus. You’re writing a suicide\
    \ note with a laugh track. You think I’m some kid who wants to save the world?\
    \ I don’t. I just want to write something that doesn't feel like a lie.”\n\nMarcus\
    \ felt a sharp, cold pressure behind his eyes. It was the sensation of a three-year-old\
    \ dam beginning to crack. He thought about the three drafts of his own pilot sitting\
    \ in his desk—the one about a man who loses everything and finds nothing. He thought\
    \ about the fact that he couldn't remember the last time he’d felt a genuine vibration\
    \ in his chest that wasn't caffeine-induced anxiety.\n\nHe looked at the \"Toenail\
    \ Clippings\" joke on the board. It was a good joke. It was a perfect joke. It\
    \ was utterly hollow.\n\nFor a second, his lip trembled. He felt the weight of\
    \ the silence in the room, the way Jerry was watching him, the way the fluorescent\
    \ lights seemed to be humming directly inside his skull. He felt like he might\
    \ actually, finally, break.\n\n“Well,” Marcus said, his voice cracking just enough\
    \ for Maya to notice. He quickly cleared his throat and plastered on a smirk.\
    \ “If I wanted to tell the truth, I’d be a priest. But the benefits are terrible\
    \ and I look like a thumb in a cassock.”\n\nThe room chuckled, the tension breaking\
    \ like a cheap prop. But Maya didn't laugh. She just watched him, her expression\
    \ one of profound, annoying pity.\n\n“The toenail joke stays,” Marcus said, turning\
    \ back to the board, his hand shaking slightly as he uncapped the marker. “But…\
    \ maybe we give the wife a line afterwards. Something about how she’s been keeping\
    \ her own box of secrets.”\n\n“Like what?” Jerry asked.\n\nMarcus looked at Maya.\
    \ She was waiting.\n\n“Like the fact that she doesn't recognize the man she’s\
    \ living with anymore,” Marcus said. He paused, then added, “But, you know, make\
    \ it funny. Give her a clown nose or something.”\n\nHe didn't laugh. But for the\
    \ first time in three years, he didn't check his watch."

    \ The humor-pathos balance is exceptionally well-calibrated. However, the emotional\
    \ climax could linger slightly longer. Marcus deflects immediately with the priest\
    \ joke, which is authentic but undercuts the vulnerability. Consider giving the\
    \ moment one additional beat—perhaps Jerry or Maya's reaction—before Marcus recovers,\
    \ to let readers sit with the crack in his armor.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Constraint\
    \ Satisfaction\nSCORE: 1.0\nEVIDENCE: All five constraints executed:\n1. Laugh\
    \ before realization: Toenail clipping joke lands, then undermined by \"He simply\
    \ checked his watch, calculating how many more 'beats' he had to manufacture\"\
    \n2. Theme by minor character: Jerry states it—\"It's the truth people are too\
    \ scared to say out loud\"\n3. Comedy craft specificity: \"You're using a 'rule\

    \ No improvement needed. Perfect constraint execution.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Beat\
    \ Execution\nSCORE: 0.93\nEVIDENCE: \n- Opening Image: \"the throne of lies\"\
    \ establishes hollowness\n- Theme Stated: Jerry's monologue about truth, crystallized\
    \ by Maya's confrontation\n- Catalyst: \"The Catalyst walked in. Maya wasn't the\
    \ wide-eyed ingenue Marcus expected.\"\nFEEDBACK: The Catalyst moment is slightly\
    \ undermined by the parenthetical meta-commentary (\"The Catalyst walked in\"\
    ). While clever, it pulls readers out of the scene mechanics. The showrunner's\
    \ immediate name-correction is strong—trust that moment to carry the introduction\
    \ without the narrator winking at the Save the Cat structure.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION:\
    \ Industry Authenticity\nSCORE: 0.82\nEVIDENCE: Strong details like \"haze of\
    \ lukewarm espresso,\" beat sheets, dry-erase markers, the showrunner's barely-suppressed\
    \ disdain. The syndicating/math debate feels lived-in.\nFEEDBACK: One moment breaks\
    \ authenticity: \"Make sure she doesn't try to put any 'heart' into the script.\
    \ We're aiming for 'cynical but digestible.'\" A real showrunner would say this\
    \ more obliquely, through subtext and tone, not as explicit ideology. This reads\
    \ as authorial commentary rather than character behavior. Consider having the\
    \ showrunner demonstrate the cynicism through action (demanding rewrites that\
    \ strip emotion) rather than stating it.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Character Depth\n\
    SCORE: 0.84\nEVIDENCE: Marcus's three-dimensionality: \"calculating how many more\
    \ 'beats' he had to manufacture,\" his three unpitched pilots about loss, the\
    \ physical manifestation of burnout. Maya: jaded yet principled (\"I don't want\
    \ to save the world? I just want to write something that doesn't feel like a lie\"\
    ), perceptive without preachiness.\nFEEDBACK: Maya needs one additional detail\
    \ that reveals her specific wound—why she's already this hard-won at junior level.\
    \ What happened to her that made her so clear-eyed? A single line about a failed\
    \ project, or a draft she's ashamed of, would elevate her from \"the mirror\"\
    \ to a full character with stakes. Consider: \"I know because I wrote three pilots\
    \ exactly like that before I figured it out.\"\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: Beat Execution\
    \ (Narrative Arc)\nSCORE: 0.96\nEVIDENCE: The story moves from Marcus's hollow\
    \ competence → Maya's confrontation → his genuine moment of vulnerability → tentative\
    \ change (adding the wife's secret line). The arc completes within a contained\
    \ scene while suggesting larger transformation.\nFEEDBACK: The ending is strong\
    \ but slightly abrupt. The final line—\"But for the first time in three years,\
    \ he didn't check his watch\"—is excellent, but consider adding 1-2 sentences\
    \ showing Marcus's physical behavior in this new space (does he lean forward on\
    \ the beat sheet? does he make eye contact with Maya?). Make the internal shift\
    \ visible.\n\n---\n\n**OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThis is a masterfully executed\
    \ story that satisfies all technical requirements while maintaining genuine emotional\
    \ resonance. The constraint satisfaction is flawless, the beat structure is clean,\
    \ and the character work—particularly Marcus's moment of near-breakdown—achieves\
    \ the difficult balance between comedy and pathos. The primary areas for refinement\
    \ are minor: reduce the on-the-nose thematic exposition from the showrunner, add\
    \ one biographical detail to Maya's character to deepen her beyond her narrative\
    \ function, and extend the climactic vulnerability moment by one beat to maximize\
    \ emotional payoff."

    \ It was the sensation of a three-year-old dam beginning to crack. He thought\
    \ about the three drafts of his own pilot sitting in his desk—the one about a\
    \ man who loses everything and finds nothing. He thought about the fact that he\
    \ couldn't remember the last time he’d felt a genuine vibration in his chest that\
    \ wasn't caffeine-induced anxiety.\n\nFor a second, his lip trembled. He felt\
    \ the weight of the silence in the room, the way Jerry was watching him with a\
    \ look of sudden, terrible recognition. Maya didn't look away; she waited, her\
    \ expression holding a mirror to the hollow space where his passion used to be.\
    \ The fluorescent lights hummed inside his skull, loud as a freight train.\n\n\
    “Well,” Marcus said, his voice cracking just enough for the room to hear. He quickly\
    \ cleared his throat and plastered on a smirk. “If I wanted to tell the truth,\
    \ I’d be a priest. But the benefits are terrible and I look like a giant thumb\
    \ in a cassock.”\n\nThe room chuckled, the tension breaking like a cheap prop.\
    \ But Maya didn't laugh. She just watched him, her expression one of profound,\
    \ annoying pity.\n\n“The toenail joke stays,” Marcus said, turning back to the\
    \ board. His hand shook slightly as he uncapped the marker, but instead of checking\
    \ the clock, he erased the final beat of the scene. “But… maybe we give the wife\
    \ a line afterwards. Something about how she’s been keeping her own box of secrets.”\n\
    \n“Like what?” Jerry asked, leaning forward.\n\nMarcus looked at Maya. She was\
    \ still waiting. \n\n“Like the fact that she doesn't recognize the man she’s living\
    \ with anymore,” Marcus said. He paused, then added, “But, you know, make it funny.\
    \ Give her a clown nose or something.”\n\nHe didn't laugh. But he didn't lean\
    \ back, either. He sat on the edge of his expensive chair, marker poised, and\
    \ for the first time in three years, he didn't check his watch. He just looked\
    \ at the board and waited for the next line of truth to surface."

    “Okay, the protagonist’s wife finds the hidden cigar box,” Marcus said, spinning\
    \ a dry-erase marker with the practiced agility of a card shark. “We need a button.\

    \ But if she finds out he’s been using the box to store his toenail clippings,\

    \ who hadn't smiled since the 2007 strike, gave a sharp bark of laughter. Marcus\
    \ didn't join them. He simply checked his watch, calculating how many more beats\
    \ he had to manufacture before he could go home to his silent apartment and eat\
    \ cereal over the sink.\n\n“God, Marcus,” Jerry, a staff writer who had survived\
    \ three heart attacks and four divorces, wheezed as he wiped his eyes. “You’re\
    \ a surgeon with the cynicism. But you know, kid, comedy isn't just about the\

    \ didn't blink. “Truth doesn't syndicate, Jerry. Math does.”\n\nThe door opened,\
    \ and Maya walked in. She wasn't the wide-eyed ingenue Marcus expected. She wore\
    \ a faded *Kids in the Hall* t-shirt and carried a notebook that looked like it\
    \ had been through a war.\n\n“Everyone, this is Chloe,” the showrunner announced,\
    \ not looking up from his phone. “Rewrite the cold open for the fourth time. And\
    \ remind her we’re not making *Lady Bird* here. If a scene feels 'poignant,' cut\
    \ it until it’s funny.”\n\n“Maya,” she corrected instantly, her voice steady.\
    \ She sat next to Marcus, her notebook already open to a page titled *The Anatomy\
    \ of a Hack*. \n\nBy 3:00 PM, the room was a haze of lukewarm espresso and the\
    \ smell of Thai takeout. Marcus was dissecting a scene with the clinical precision\
    \ of a coroner.\n\n“You’re doing it wrong,” Maya said. It was the first time she’d\
    \ spoken.\n\nThe room went silent. Marcus looked up from the beat sheet. “Excuse\
    \ me?”\n\n“The reversal in Scene C,” she said, pointing at the board. “You’re\
    \ using a ‘rule of three’ to bury the fact that the character is lonely. You’re\
    \ hiding the character behind the joke. I know, because I spent two years writing\
    \ 'snarky best friend' parts for pilots that died in development. You start to\
    \ think the armor is the person.”\n\n“That’s the job, Maya,” Marcus said, his\
    \ voice dropping into a low, dangerous register. “We build the armor. If the audience\
    \ is laughing, they can’t see the ribs breaking underneath. It’s a defense mechanism\
    \ that pays for a Tesla.”\n\n“Is that why you haven't looked at the script once\
    \ today?” she asked. She stepped closer, her eyes scanning the board, then landing\
    \ on him. “You’re not writing comedy, Marcus. You’re writing a suicide note with\
    \ a laugh track. You think I’m some kid who wants to save the world? I don’t.\
    \ I just want to write something that doesn't feel like a lie.”\n\nMarcus felt\

    \"I even wrote a spec about my dad's funeral just to see if I could make the hospice\

    \ his skill, his cynicism, his despair, and his capacity for change. Maya, however,\
    \ is somewhat thinner. She functions primarily as a mirror/catalyst for Marcus's\
    \ realization. Strengthen her by adding ONE personal detail that shows her stakes—not\
    \ explained through dialogue, but *shown*. For example:\n- What's in that notebook\
    \ titled *The Anatomy of a Hack*? Show a page.\n- Why does she care enough to\
    \ confront him? Is she fighting her own version of Marcus? \n- Her \"nervous tic\"\
    \ (twisting the ring) is good, but needs callback—does Marcus notice it? Does\
    \ she notice *him* noticing?\n\nThe ring appears once; make it matter twice.\n\
    \n---\n\n## OVERALL ASSESSMENT\n\nThis is a strong story that nails emotional\
    \ beats and satisfies all technical constraints. The dialogue is sharp, and Marcus's\
    \ quasi-redemption arc feels earned despite its brevity. The primary weakness\
    \ is that Maya reads as a plot device rather than a fully realized person—she's\
    \ perceptive because the story needs her to be, not because we understand *why*\
    \ she sees through Marcus's armor. Deepen her interiority and give her one scene-specific\
    \ action or vulnerability, and this becomes excellent. The structural incompleteness\
    \ (missing acts beyond Catalyst) is forgivable in a short format, but if expanded,\
    \ would need clearer commitment thresholds for Marcus."

    \ But if she finds out he’s been using the box to store his toenail clippings,\
    \ it’s a Tuesday night on CBS.”\n\nThe room erupted. Even the showrunner, a man\
    \ who hadn't smiled since the 2007 strike, gave a sharp bark of laughter. Marcus\
    \ didn't join them. He simply checked his watch, calculating how many more beats\
    \ he had to manufacture before he could go home to his silent apartment and eat\
    \ cereal over the sink.\n\n“God, Marcus,” Jerry, a staff writer who had survived\
    \ three heart attacks and four divorces, wheezed as he wiped his eyes. “You’re\

    \ didn't blink. “Truth doesn't syndicate, Jerry. Math does.”\n\nThe door opened,\
    \ and Maya walked in. She wore a faded *Kids in the Hall* t-shirt and carried\
    \ a notebook titled *The Anatomy of a Hack*. \n\n“Everyone, this is Chloe,” the\
    \ showrunner announced, his eyes never leaving a spreadsheet on his iPad. “Rewrite\
    \ the cold open for the fourth time. And remind her we’re not making *Lady Bird*\
    \ here. If a scene feels 'poignant,' cut it until it’s funny.”\n\n“Maya,” she\
    \ corrected. Her voice was steady, but she was twisting a silver ring on her index\
    \ finger—a nervous tic she couldn't quite mask. She sat next to Marcus, the smell\
    \ of stale rain clinging to her jacket.\n\nBy 3:00 PM, the room was a haze of\
    \ lukewarm espresso and the smell of Thai takeout. A delivery guy poked his head\
    \ in, yelled about Pad See Ew, and left. Marcus was dissecting a scene with the\
    \ clinical precision of a coroner.\n\n“You’re doing it wrong,” Maya said. \n\n\
    The room went silent. Jerry paused with a forkful of noodles halfway to his mouth.\
    \ Marcus looked up. “Excuse me?”\n\n“The reversal in Scene C,” she said, pointing\
    \ at the board. “You’re using a ‘rule of three’ to bury the fact that the character\
    \ is lonely. I know, because I spent two years writing 'snarky best friend' parts\
    \ for pilots that died in development. I even wrote a spec about my dad’s funeral\
    \ just to see if I could make the hospice nurse funny. You start to think the\
    \ armor is the person. But you're hiding, Marcus.”\n\n“That’s the job, Maya,”\
    \ Marcus said, his voice dropping. “We build the armor. If the audience is laughing,\
    \ they can’t see the ribs breaking underneath. It’s a defense mechanism that pays\
    \ for a Tesla.”\n\n“Is that why you haven't looked at the script once today?”\
    \ she asked. She stepped closer, her eyes scanning the board. “You’re not writing\
    \ comedy. You’re writing a suicide note with a laugh track. I don't want to save\
    \ the world, Marcus. I just want to write something that doesn't feel like a lie.”\n\
    \nMarcus felt a sharp, cold pressure behind his eyes. He thought about the three\
    \ drafts of his own pilot sitting in his desk—*The Long Division*, a comedy about\
    \ a man trying to calculate the exact moment his marriage became a ghost story.\
    \ He hadn't touched it in three years.\n\nFor a second, his lip trembled. He felt\
    \ the weight of the silence, the way Jerry was watching him with a look of sudden,\
    \ terrible recognition. The fluorescent lights hummed inside his skull, loud as\
    \ a freight train. He felt the dam of his own indifference finally, violently,\
    \ begin to give way.\n\n“Well,” Marcus said, his voice cracking just enough for\
    \ the room to hear. He quickly cleared his throat and plastered on a smirk. “If\
    \ I wanted to tell the truth, I’d be a priest. But the benefits are terrible and\
    \ I look like a giant thumb in a cassock.”\n\nThe room chuckled, the tension breaking\
    \ like a cheap prop. But Maya didn't laugh. She just watched him, her expression\
    \ one of profound, annoying pity.\n\n“The toenail joke stays,” Marcus said. He\
    \ stood up, his hand shaking slightly as he uncapped the marker. He didn't check\
    \ the clock. Instead, he walked to the board and erased the \"button\" he’d just\
    \ won the room with.\n\n“What are you doing?” the showrunner barked.\n\n“Fixing\
    \ it,” Marcus said. He wrote a new line for the wife. It wasn't a punchline. It\
    \ was a question about why they still shared a bed. He looked at Maya, then at\
    \ the board, then back at Maya. \n\n“It’s not 'digestible,'” Marcus murmured,\
    \ mostly to himself. \n\nHe didn't lean back into his expensive chair. He stayed\
    \ at the board, marker poised, his eyes finally tracking the story instead of\
    \ the time. He reached into his pocket, pulled out his phone, and turned it off.\n\
    \n“Okay,” Marcus said, his voice regaining a different kind of strength. “Let’s\

  \ of three’ to bury the fact that the character is lonely. I know, because I spent\
  \ two years writing 'snarky best friend' parts for pilots that died in development.\
  \ I even wrote a spec about my dad’s funeral just to see if I could make the hospice\
  \ nurse funny. You start to think the armor is the person. But you're hiding, Marcus.\
  \ I used to keep your old scripts under my pillow, and now I can't even find you\
  \ in this room.”\n\n“That’s the job, Maya,” Marcus said, his voice dropping. “We\
  \ build the armor. If the audience is laughing, they can’t see the ribs breaking\
  \ underneath. It’s a defense mechanism that pays for a Tesla.”\n\n“Is that why you\
  \ haven't looked at the script once today?” she asked. She stepped closer, her eyes\
  \ scanning the board. “You’re not writing comedy. You’re writing a suicide note\
  \ with a laugh track. I don't want to save the world, Marcus. I just want to write\
  \ something that doesn't feel like a lie.”\n\nMarcus felt a sharp, cold pressure\
  \ behind his eyes. He thought about the three drafts of his own pilot sitting in\
  \ his desk—*The Long Division*, a comedy about a man trying to calculate the exact\
  \ moment his marriage became a ghost story. He hadn't touched it in three years.\n\
  \nFor a second, his lip trembled. He felt the weight of the silence, the way Jerry\
  \ was watching him with a look of sudden, terrible recognition. The fluorescent\
  \ lights hummed inside his skull. He felt the dam of his own indifference finally,\
  \ violently, begin to give way.\n\n“Well,” Marcus said, his voice cracking just\
  \ enough for the room to hear. He quickly cleared his throat and plastered on a\
  \ smirk. “If I wanted to tell the truth, I’d be a priest. But the benefits are terrible\
  \ and I look like a giant thumb in a cassock.”\n\nThe room chuckled, but the sound\
  \ was thin. Maya didn't laugh. She just stopped twisting her ring and looked at\
  \ him with a profound, annoying pity.\n\nMarcus stood up. His hand shook as he uncapped\
  \ the marker. He looked at the \"toenail\" joke—the safe, easy laugh that would\
  \ keep the showrunner happy and the check coming. He knew that erasing it was the\
  \ beginning of a long, difficult afternoon of \"notes\" and \"network pushback.\"\
  \ He might even get fired.\n\nHe erased it anyway. \n\nHis hand hovered over the\
  \ white space. He wanted to write the joke back. His fingers literally twitched\
  \ with the urge to be \"digestible.\" Instead, he forced the marker down and wrote\
  \ a new line for the wife. It wasn't a punchline. It was a question about why they\
  \ still shared a bed.\n\n“What are you doing?” the showrunner barked, finally looking\
  \ up. “That’s not a button. That’s a downer.”\n\n“It’s the truth,” Marcus said,\
  \ his voice regaining a different kind of strength. He turned to Maya. She wasn't\
  \ twisting her ring anymore; she was nodding. \n\nMarcus didn't lean back into his\
  \ expensive chair. He stayed at the board, marker poised, his eyes finally tracking\
  \ the story instead of the time. He reached into his pocket, pulled out his phone,\
  \ and turned it off.\n\n“Okay,” Marcus said, looking at the room of tired, cynical\
  \ faces. “Let’s talk about why she’s actually staying. And Jerry? Make it hurt before\
  \ you make it funny.”"
