  evidence: 'Versions 0–3 were largely truncated repetitions that established Elena''s
    competence and the hospital setting but lacked the narrative beats and resolution.
    The final output substantially improved: it preserved the original efficient,
    controlled depiction of Elena (competence) and added a concrete crisis (ventilator
    shortage) to reinforce that competence. It then introduced Dr. Sharma and Mrs.
    Gable and a specific medical detail (oxygen saturation drop resolving when Elena
    connects with the patient) to create a catalytic scene. Elena''s flaw (emotional
    hollowness) is shown after competence, and her transformation is internal—an emergent
    empathy and quieter priorities—rather than an external change in status. The friendship
    with Dr. Sharma is earned via shared bedside caregiving and follow-up conversations,
    though its brevity makes it a budding, not fully developed, friendship. The ending
    leaves room for doubt—Elena still keeps her routines but now ''occasionally''
    perceives a different note—so the final line maintains ambiguity about whether
    she has truly changed. Overall, the draft moved from incomplete repetition to
    a cohesive, constrained-compliant story with only minor weaknesses in the depth
    of the friendship arc and the subtlety of the ambiguous ending.'
