  evidence: Early critiques focused on Teddy's interiority being told rather than
    shown. The final output responds by adding embodied sensations and concrete sensory
    details (e.g., 'his feet... faltered', 'fingers still slightly trembling', the
    exact 5:30/5:45 routine, Mrs. Gable's light at 6:02, honeysuckle scent). These
    changes deepen interiority and preserve strengths (the loving routine detail).
    The disruption (road closure) is used to reveal what Teddy has been avoiding—neighborhood
    change and his avoidance of confronting loneliness—which is clearer in the final
    draft. However, the documented revision history (Versions 0–3) shows repeated
    text with little visible iterative change, so the substantive improvement appears
    concentrated in the final expanded output rather than a clear, steady revision
    trajectory. Some telling language still remains (phrases like 'he felt adrift'
    and 'the shield of his routine suddenly translucent'), so while showing is substantially
    improved, subtlety is not fully realized.
