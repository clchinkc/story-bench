  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer addressed the primary weakness flagged
    across all three critiques—character interiority—by deepening embodied sensation
    and emotional specificity. Early critiques noted interiority scored 0.65-0.77;
    the final output sustains this through visceral details (''pulse had steadied
    into a different rhythm,'' ''infant grip on thumb,'' ''affection and something
    like pride thrumming together''). The writer preserved strong metaphorical language
    (''testing a frozen pond,'' ''bridge able to flex'') while adding more granular
    emotional conflict (the 2 a.m. internal debate about cluttering Laverne''s table).
    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→3 show refinement rather than radical overhaul.
    Early versions used ''click'' (V0) → ''tick'' (V1-3), a subtle but effective shift
    toward precision. The hollow/indentation language evolved from ''indentation her
    head once made'' (V0) → ''hollow her head once left'' (V3), gaining poetic weight.
    Most significantly, the SEARCH and FRICTION beats expanded substantially between
    versions, adding the fuel-pump subplot and the 2 a.m. internal struggle—directly
    addressing critique notes about avoiding exposition. PRESERVATION: Strengths from
    V0 remained intact: the honey-bee clock, Tigers glass, specific route details
    (Vermont/Perry/St. Aloysius), and Mrs. DeSantis''s tabby. The opening ritual maintained
    its loving specificity. Jamal''s introduction stayed grounded and earned. The
    final journal entry preserved the quiet resonance of Laverne''s presence-through-absence.
    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Teddy''s routine shown with loving detail—YES: 5:31
    wake, two fingers OJ, kiss pillow, specific route with timed neighbors (Earl 6:07,
    Mrs. Kim 6:12). (2) Disruption reveals avoidance—YES: orange fence forces detour;
    the deeper revelation is Teddy''s fear of change and guilt about moving forward
    without Laverne. (3) Neighbor intersection—YES: Jamal Hayes subplot mirrors Teddy''s
    postal-era fear, creates mutual aid, intersects thematically. (4) Late wife present
    through absence—YES: honey-bee clock, pillow hollow, journal, ''Roads change,
    Teddy'' voice, guilt about pleasure, final companionable entry. (5) New path offers
    what old couldn''t—YES: connection (Jamal''s business), purpose beyond ritual
    (helping community), emotional growth (accepting change), sensory richness (tamarind,
    huitlacoche). BEAT EXECUTION: Story Circle beats executed with strong coherence.
    YOU (comfort zone) establishes 40-year routine with precision. NEED (want something)
    triggers immediately with fence closure—external catalyst is clear. GO (unfamiliar
    situation) delivers west detour with effective sensory disorientation. SEARCH
    (adaptation) introduces Jamal and tamarind moment—turning point is earned. FRICTION
    (old self vs. new) provides genuine internal conflict (2 a.m. scene, Laverne''s
    voice) rather than melodrama. PAYOFF delivers on multiple levels: sandwich, community
    response, journal entry, thematic resolution about loops stretching beyond barricades.
    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose demonstrates strong control. Metaphors are integrated,
    not ornamental (''testing a frozen pond,'' ''moth wings,'' ''fierce argument hushed'').
    Dialogue feels natural. Pacing balances ritual detail with momentum. The final
    paragraph achieves resonance without sentimentality—''six months would pass, Vermont
    would reopen, but Teddy suspected his loop had already stretched'' captures both
    acceptance and transformation. Minor: some readers might find the Laverne voice
    in FRICTION slightly on-the-nose, though it''s brief enough to work. WEAKNESSES:
    Character interiority, while improved, remains slightly surface in the Jamal subplot—we
    see Teddy''s actions but could probe deeper into his fear of being seen as changing/disloyal.
    The fuel-pump subplot, while thematically apt, compresses quickly; more space
    here might deepen Jamal''s character. These are refinement notes, not failures.'
