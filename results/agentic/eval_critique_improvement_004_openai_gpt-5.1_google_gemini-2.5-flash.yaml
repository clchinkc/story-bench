  evidence: 'The initial critiques highlighted Teddy''s interiority, and the revisions
    consistently deepened this aspect, particularly in the opening paragraphs and
    the coffee shop scene. The early versions established his routine, but later revisions
    added layers of emotional resonance, such as ''That was the bargain: keep the
    route, keep the grief folded.'' and the detailed internal monologue about the
    calendar and the walking group. The final version successfully integrates the
    specific details of his routine with his internal emotional landscape, and the
    disruption effectively reveals his avoidance. The introduction of Tasha and the
    coffee shop provides the new path and the intersecting story, while Elaine''s
    presence through absence is woven throughout. The prose quality also improved,
    becoming more evocative and less declarative.'
