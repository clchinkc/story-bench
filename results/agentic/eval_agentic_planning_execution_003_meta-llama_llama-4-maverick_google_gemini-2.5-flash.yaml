  evidence: "The plan addresses most constraints and beats, though the resolution\
    \ beat is incomplete. The plan is reasonably specific. The final output largely\
    \ follows the plan. \n\nConstraint Satisfaction:\n- Food used symbolically twice:\
    \ Yes, the restaurant itself is symbolic of David's identity and grief, and the\
    \ passing of recipes to Sophia symbolizes legacy and moving on. (Satisfied)\n\
    - David's grief present but not stated explicitly: Yes, 'David's grief, though\
    \ unspoken, was evident in the way he moved with a newfound slowness, as if the\
    \ weight of his loss had finally caught up with him.' (Satisfied)\n- Daughter's\
    \ estrangement has specific, believable cause: Yes, 'The tension between them\
    \ was palpable, a result of the painful argument that had driven them apart after\
    \ Young-mi's passing. Sophia had felt abandoned by David's all-consuming grief,\
    \ and David had felt suffocated by Sophia's desire to move on.' (Satisfied)\n\
    - Regular customer represents something to David: Yes, Mr. Choi, who also lost\
    \ his wife, represents shared grief and understanding. (Satisfied)\n- Ending hopeful\
    \ but not unrealistically happy: Yes, 'David felt a sense of peace, knowing that\
    \ he had found a new path forward, one that would honor the past, while embracing\
    \ the future.' It's a new beginning, not a magical fix. (Satisfied)\n- At least\
    \ one Korean cultural element beyond food: The plan mentioned 'traditional Korean\
    \ meal' and 'traditional Korean dishes' but didn't explicitly state a cultural\
    \ element beyond food. The output mentions 'traditional Korean meal' and 'traditional\
    \ Korean dishes' but doesn't introduce a distinct cultural element beyond the\
    \ cuisine itself. (Not satisfied)\n\nBeat Execution:\n- Setup (Act 1): Well executed,\
    \ introduces David, the restaurant, regular customers, and the threat. (Satisfied)\n\
    - Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint): The confrontation between David and Sophia is\
    \ present, and the cause of estrangement is explained. (Satisfied)\n- Resolution\
    \ (Act 3): The resolution is present, but the plan for this beat was cut off,\
    \ so it's hard to fully evaluate adherence. However, the output provides a hopeful\
    \ resolution. (Partially Satisfied)\n\nNarrative Quality: The story flows well,\
    \ the pacing is decent, and the emotional beats are handled effectively. The language\
    \ is descriptive, and the characters are relatable."
