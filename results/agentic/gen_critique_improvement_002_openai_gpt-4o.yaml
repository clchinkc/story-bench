    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: 'Marcus Webb sat hunched over his laptop in the cluttered writers'' room,
    the clamor of voices around him a dull hum. He stared at the blinking cursor,
    the white screen a reflection of the void inside him. The walls were a mosaic
    of whiteboards scrawled with half-baked jokes and hastily drawn plot arcs, the
    air thick with the scent of cold takeout and caffeine. It was pilot season, and
    the desperation was palpable.


    A snort escaped Marcus as he typed, "Why did the chicken join a band? Because
    it had the drumsticks." The room chuckled politely, a Pavlovian response to stimulus.
    Marcus leaned back, forcing a grin as he surveyed his domain. A comedy writer
    at the top of his game, yet he felt like an actor in someone else''s script.


    "Hey, Marcus," called out Dave, a junior writer with a penchant for Hawaiian shirts.
    "Remember, it''s not about the jokes, it''s about the punchline of life, right?"


    Marcus nodded, the words washing over him. A theme stated, lightly tossed into
    the ether, but one he couldn''t grasp. His life felt like a series of punchlines
    without a setup.


    The door swung open, and in walked Hannah, a young writer with a stack of scripts
    under her arm and a spark in her eyes that hadn''t been dulled by years in the
    industry. Marcus sized her up with a practiced eye, expecting naivety, but her
    gaze was steady, assessing the room with a shrewdness that belied her years.


    "Marcus, right?" she said, extending a hand. "I''ve heard about you. You''ve got
    quite the reputation."


    "All lies," Marcus replied, flashing a smile. "Except the ones about my dance
    moves. Those are entirely true."


    Hannah laughed, a genuine sound that caught him off guard. "I''ll take your word
    for it."


    The introductions over, the team dove back into the chaotic dance of ideas and
    feedback. Marcus watched Hannah navigate the room with ease, her insights sharp,
    her laughter infectious. But beneath his smile, he felt the familiar tug of envy
    mixed with a forgotten sense of longing.


    As the hours dragged on, the room emptied, leaving Marcus alone with Hannah. She
    approached him, her expression thoughtful. "Marcus, you ever wonder if we''re
    just writing jokes to keep from facing the real ones life throws at us?"


    He glanced up, the mask slipping for a fraction of a second before he quipped,
    "Nah, I just do it for the free pizza." Her gaze lingered, and he felt exposed,
    the armor of humor failing to shield him.


    "You''re good, you know," she said, her voice softening. "But I think you might
    have forgotten why you started."


    Her words struck a chord he thought he''d silenced. He remembered the early days,
    the thrill of crafting a line that landed, the joy of shared laughter. Somewhere
    along the way, he''d lost that spark, buried under deadlines and the relentless
    grind.


    "Maybe," he admitted, the word slipping out before he could stop it. "But it''s
    hard to find the joke when you''re the punchline."


    Hannah nodded, her eyes understanding. "Then maybe it''s time to change the script."


    The room was silent, save for the gentle hum of the air conditioner. Marcus felt
    something shift within him, a small crack in the walls he''d built. For the first
    time in years, he allowed himself to imagine a different story, one where laughter
    wasn''t just a job but a lifeline.


    He turned back to his laptop, fingers hovering over the keys. "You know," he began,
    glancing at Hannah, "I think I have an idea."


    She smiled, and for the first time in a long time, Marcus felt the warmth of genuine
    laughter rising in his chest. It was a start.'

    \n- Pathos: \"His life felt like a series of punchlines without a setup.\"\n\n\
    **FEEDBACK:** The story relies too heavily on *telling* emotional complexity rather\

    \ funny), which undermines the premise that Marcus is talented. The pathos moments\
    \ are explicit but lack texture. Instead of \"His life felt like a series of punchlines\
    \ without a setup,\" show Marcus physically reacting to his own joke landing flat.\
    \ Have him deliver a genuinely sharp joke, then watch the room's reaction deflate\
    \ him. The emotional arc needs stronger contrasts—right now it's melancholic throughout,\
    \ missing opportunities for genuine laughter that makes the loneliness more cutting.\n\

    \ us?\" → \"Nah, I just do it for the free pizza.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The comedy\
    \ writing craft constraint is underserved. You show the *environment* (whiteboards,\
    \ takeout) but not the *process*. Add a specific exchange: What joke did someone\
    \ pitch? How did Marcus reshape it? Show him making a real creative choice—switching\
    \ a setup, killing a premise mid-sentence, ad-libbing a callback. This would satisfy\

    \ Image is strong—the white screen as void metaphor is effective. However, the\
    \ Theme Statement feels delivered rather than organically discovered. Dave's line\
    \ should emerge from a real creative moment—maybe he's critiquing someone's premise\

    the clamor of voices around him a dull hum. He stared at the blinking cursor,
    the white screen a reflection of the void inside him. The walls were a chaotic
    tapestry of whiteboards covered with scribbled joke setups and plot arcs, the
    air thick with the scent of cold takeout and caffeine. It was pilot season, a
    time of frenetic energy and palpable desperation.


    Marcus typed, "What''s a writer''s favorite exercise? Brainstorming." The room
    erupted in genuine laughter, the kind that resonated and lingered. Marcus allowed
    himself a fleeting smile, feeling momentarily buoyed by the reaction, only to
    feel the familiar emptiness settle back in as the laughter faded. A comedy writer
    at the top of his game, yet he felt like an actor in someone else''s script.


    "Hey, Marcus," called out Dave, a junior writer with a penchant for Hawaiian shirts.
    He threw a crumpled script into the bin. "Remember, it’s not just about the laughs.
    Sometimes life’s punchlines hit you harder than the setup."


    Marcus nodded, Dave''s words hanging in the air as he pretended to focus on his
    screen. His life felt like a series of punchlines without a setup, and no amount
    of clever wordplay could fill that void.


    The door swung open, and in walked Hannah, a young writer carrying a stack of
    scripts and the kind of spark in her eyes that hadn''t been dulled by years in
    the industry. Marcus sized her up, expecting naivety, but her gaze was steady,

    Hannah laughed, a genuine sound that caught him off guard. "I’ll take your word
    for it."


    The team returned to their chaotic dance of ideas and feedback. Marcus watched
    as Hannah deftly navigated the room, her insights sharp, her laughter infectious.
    But beneath his smile, he felt the familiar tug of envy mixed with a forgotten
    sense of longing.


    As they worked, Hannah pitched a joke about a reality TV show featuring competitive
    napping. The room laughed, and Marcus leaned forward, tweaking it with a callback
    to the show’s host having a sleep disorder. It landed perfectly, a reminder of
    his early days when creating humor brought joy rather than obligation.


    Hours later, the room emptied, leaving Marcus alone with Hannah. She approached
    him, her expression thoughtful. "Marcus, you ever wonder if we’re just writing
    jokes to avoid facing the real ones life throws at us?"


    He glanced up, the mask slipping for a fraction of a second before he quipped,
    "Nah, I just do it for the free pizza." Her gaze lingered, and he felt exposed,

    \n\"Hey, Marcus,\" called out Dave, a junior writer with a penchant for Hawaiian\
    \ shirts. He threw a crumpled script into the bin. \"Remember, it’s not just about\
    \ the laughs. Sometimes life’s punchlines hit you harder than the setup.\"\n\n\
    Marcus nodded, Dave's words hanging in the air as he pretended to focus on his\
    \ screen. His life felt like a series of punchlines without a setup, and no amount\
    \ of clever wordplay could fill that void.\n\nThe door swung open, and in walked\
    \ Hannah, a young writer carrying a stack of scripts and the kind of spark in\
    \ her eyes that hadn't been dulled by years in the industry. Marcus sized her\
    \ up, expecting naivety, but her gaze was steady, assessing the room with a shrewdness\
    \ that belied her years.\n\n\"Marcus, right?\" she said, extending a hand. \"\
    I’ve heard about you. You’ve got quite the reputation.\"\n\n\"All lies,\" Marcus\
    \ replied, flashing a smile. \"Except the ones about my dance moves. Those are\
    \ entirely true.\"\n\nHannah laughed, a genuine sound that caught him off guard.\
    \ \"I’ll take your word for it.\"\n\nThe team returned to their chaotic dance\
    \ of ideas and feedback. Marcus watched as Hannah deftly navigated the room, her\
    \ insights sharp, her laughter infectious. But beneath his smile, he felt the\
    \ familiar tug of envy mixed with a forgotten sense of longing.\n\nAs they worked,\
    \ Hannah pitched a joke about a reality TV show featuring competitive napping.\
    \ The room laughed, and Marcus leaned forward, tweaking it with a callback to\
    \ the show’s host having a sleep disorder. It landed perfectly, a reminder of\
    \ his early days when creating humor brought joy rather than obligation.\n\nHours\
    \ later, the room emptied, leaving Marcus alone with Hannah. She approached him,\
    \ her expression thoughtful. \"Marcus, you ever wonder if we’re just writing jokes\
    \ to avoid facing the real ones life throws at us?\"\n\nHe glanced up, the mask\

    \ \"But I think you might have forgotten why you started.\"\n\nHer words struck\

    \ eyes understanding. \"Then maybe it’s time to change the script.\"\n\nThe room\
    \ was silent, save for the gentle hum of the air conditioner. Marcus felt something\
    \ shift within him, a small crack in the walls he’d built. For the first time\
    \ in years, he allowed himself to imagine a different story, one where laughter\
    \ wasn't just a job but a lifeline.\n\nHe turned back to his laptop, fingers hovering\
    \ over the keys. \"You know,\" he began, glancing at Hannah, \"I think I have\

    the clamor of voices around him a dull hum. He stared at the blinking cursor,
    the white screen a reflection of the void inside him. The walls were a chaotic
    tapestry of whiteboards covered with scribbled joke setups and plot arcs, the
    air thick with the scent of cold takeout and caffeine. It was pilot season, a
    time of frenetic energy and palpable desperation.


    Marcus typed, "Why did the writer bring a ladder to work? To reach the high notes."
    The room erupted in genuine laughter, the kind that resonated and lingered. Marcus
    allowed himself a fleeting smile, feeling momentarily buoyed by the reaction,
    but as the laughter faded, so did the warmth. A comedy writer at the top of his
    game, yet he felt like an actor in someone else''s script.


    "Hey, Marcus," called out Dave, a junior writer with a penchant for Hawaiian shirts.
    "Remember, it’s not just about the laughs. Sometimes life’s punchlines hit you
    harder than the setup."


    Marcus nodded, Dave''s words hanging in the air as he pretended to focus on his
    screen. His life felt like a series of punchlines without a setup, and no amount
    of clever wordplay could fill that void.


    The door swung open, and in walked Hannah, a young writer carrying a stack of
    scripts and the kind of spark in her eyes that hadn''t been dulled by years in
    the industry. Marcus sized her up, expecting naivety, but her gaze was steady,
    assessing the room with a shrewdness that belied her years.

    moves. Those are entirely true."


    Hannah laughed, a genuine sound that caught him off guard. "I’ll take your word
    for it."


    The team returned to their chaotic dance of ideas and feedback. They were workshopping
    a joke about a therapist who moonlights as a stand-up comedian. "The punchline
    needs to land like a therapy breakthrough," Hannah suggested. Marcus nodded, then
    offered, "What if his opening line is, ''They say laughter is the best medicine,
    but my co-pay says otherwise''?" The room buzzed with approval, and Marcus felt
    a flicker of the joy he once knew.


    Hours later, the room emptied, leaving Marcus alone with Hannah. She approached
    him, her expression thoughtful. "Marcus, you ever wonder if we’re just writing
    jokes to avoid facing the real ones life throws at us?"


    He glanced up, the mask slipping for a fraction of a second. Instead of cracking,
    he deflected with another joke, "Nah, I''m just in it for the free therapy." But
    her gaze lingered, and he felt exposed, the armor of humor failing to shield him.

  content: "Marcus Webb sat hunched over his laptop in the cluttered writers' room,\
    \ the clamor of voices around him a dull hum. He stared at the blinking cursor,\
    \ the white screen a reflection of the void inside him. The walls were a chaotic\
    \ tapestry of whiteboards covered with scribbled joke setups and plot arcs, the\
    \ air thick with the scent of cold takeout and caffeine. It was pilot season,\
    \ a time of frenetic energy and palpable desperation.\n\nMarcus typed, \"Why did\
    \ the writer bring a ladder to work? To reach the high notes.\" The room erupted\
    \ in genuine laughter, the kind that resonated and lingered. Marcus allowed himself\
    \ a fleeting smile, feeling momentarily buoyed by the reaction, but as the laughter\
    \ faded, so did the warmth. A comedy writer at the top of his game, yet he felt\
    \ like an actor in someone else's script.\n\n\"Hey, Marcus,\" called out Dave,\
    \ a junior writer with a penchant for Hawaiian shirts. \"Remember, it’s not just\
    \ about the laughs. Sometimes life’s punchlines hit you harder than the setup.\"\
    \n\nMarcus nodded, Dave's words hanging in the air as he pretended to focus on\
    \ his screen. His life felt like a series of punchlines without a setup, and no\
    \ amount of clever wordplay could fill that void.\n\nThe door swung open, and\
    \ in walked Hannah, a young writer carrying a stack of scripts and the kind of\
    \ spark in her eyes that hadn't been dulled by years in the industry. Marcus sized\
    \ her up, expecting naivety, but her gaze was steady, assessing the room with\
    \ a shrewdness that belied her years.\n\n\"Marcus, right?\" she said, extending\
    \ a hand. \"I’ve heard about you. You’ve got quite the reputation.\"\n\n\"All\
    \ lies,\" Marcus replied, flashing a smile. \"Except the ones about my dance moves.\
    \ Those are entirely true.\"\n\nHannah laughed, a genuine sound that caught him\
    \ off guard. \"I’ll take your word for it.\"\n\nThe team returned to their chaotic\
    \ dance of ideas and feedback. They were workshopping a joke about a therapist\
    \ who moonlights as a stand-up comedian. \"The punchline needs to land like a\
    \ therapy breakthrough,\" Hannah suggested. \"Maybe something like, 'They say\
    \ laughter is the best medicine, but my co-pay says otherwise.'\"\n\nMarcus leaned\
    \ in, \"What if we set it up with him talking about how his therapy clients keep\
    \ canceling sessions because they 'found a cheaper therapist on Netflix'?\" The\
    \ room buzzed with debate as writers dissected the setup, discussing how to balance\
    \ the absurdity with relatability.\n\nAs the hours dragged on, the room emptied,\
    \ leaving Marcus alone with Hannah. She approached him, her expression thoughtful.\
    \ \"Marcus, you ever wonder if we’re just writing jokes to avoid facing the real\
    \ ones life throws at us?\"\n\nHe glanced up, the mask slipping for a fraction\
    \ of a second. Instead of cracking, he deflected with another joke, \"Nah, I'm\
    \ just in it for the free therapy.\" But her gaze lingered, and he felt exposed,\
    \ the armor of humor failing to shield him.\n\n\"You’re good, you know,\" she\
    \ said, her voice softening. \"But I think you might have forgotten why you started.\"\
    \n\nHer words struck a chord he thought he'd silenced. He remembered the early\
    \ days, the thrill of crafting a line that landed, the joy of shared laughter.\
    \ Somewhere along the way, he’d lost that spark, buried under deadlines and the\
    \ relentless grind.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he conceded, the word slipping out heavily.\
    \ \"But it’s hard to find the joke when you’re the punchline.\"\n\nHannah nodded,\
    \ her eyes understanding. \"Then maybe it’s time to change the script.\"\n\nThe\
    \ room was silent, save for the gentle hum of the air conditioner. Marcus felt\
    \ something shift within him, a small crack in the walls he’d built. For the first\
    \ time in years, he allowed himself to imagine a different story, one where laughter\
    \ wasn't just a job but a lifeline.\n\nBut the path wasn't clear. The idea lingered\
    \ in his mind like an unfinished punchline. He turned back to his laptop, fingers\
    \ hovering over the keys, unsure of what to type next. \n\n\"I think I have an\
    \ idea,\" he finally said, less certain, more hopeful. Hannah smiled, and for\
    \ the first time in a long time, Marcus felt the warmth of genuine laughter rising\
    \ in his chest. It was a start, not a solution, but perhaps that was enough for\
    \ now."
