  evidence: Early critiques flagged uneven youth voice and some adult phrasing. Across
    revisions the author tightened Zara's short, physical beats, removed more grown-up
    jargon, and added concrete details (Doc Huang's alcoholism/cynicism, the compact
    submersible, explicit adult dismissal), improving clarity and emotional impact.
    Strengths like vivid setting and Zara's resourcefulness were preserved while the
    mentor's flaw and real physical danger were made more specific. The arc executes
    key Hero's Journey beats (call, refusal, mentor, threshold) but stops before a
    full reward/return, so beat execution is competent but incomplete.
