  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with detailed structural breakdown.
    All 4 required beats present: Catalyst (body discovery), Debate (PTSD/Zhou theory),
    Break into Two (solo investigation), Midpoint (confrontation with Owen over livestream).
    Constraints mostly satisfied: (1) False lead—Calvin Zhou gig-worker theory well-planted
    and abandoned; (2) Unconventional technique—pluviometric profiling via synesthesia
    is creative and distinctive; (3) Ticking clock—47:59 countdown hijacked by Janus
    is visceral; (4) Betrayal—Owen''s livestream breach is earned and emotionally
    resonant; (5) Direct confrontation at midpoint—Marcus physically confronts Owen
    over exploitation, no violence. Execution matches plan closely with vivid sensory
    details (rain sounds, neon reflections, brine taste). Pacing accelerates effectively
    from investigation to crisis. WEAKNESSES: (1) Past failure confrontation incomplete—Marcus
    acknowledges the 47-minute wait but doesn''t fully reckon with his role in Elise''s
    death; the reflection feels more like acceptance than deep reckoning. The line
    ''I waited forty-seven minutes that night because protocol said backup'' is more
    excuse than confrontation. (2) Midpoint confrontation, while present, is brief
    (3 exchanges) and lacks the depth of a true turning point—Owen''s counter-argument
    (''You think catching him won''t cost anything?'') deserves more exploration.
    (3) Plan mentions ''Fun & Games'' montage but output jumps from Baxter dismissal
    to shipyard trap, skipping the promised rain-pattern profiling sequence. Minor:
    Janus''s voice/characterization could be more distinctive. CALIBRATION: Output
    delivers strong thriller mechanics with excellent constraint integration, but
    the explicit past-failure confrontation requirement is underexecuted—it''s present
    but surface-level rather than the psychological reckoning the constraint demands.'
