  evidence: 'Plan: Clearly delineated characters, beats, and constraints (kimchi symbolism,
    missed-wedding cause, Mrs. Chen, demolition notice, Korean ritual). Specific events/days
    and objects (7-day notice, recipe journal, incense) increase specificity. Final
    story: follows plan closely — opening kimchi fermentation and demolition notice;
    Sophie’s arrival and explicit cause of estrangement (he missed her wedding due
    to keeping the restaurant open during COVID); Mrs. Chen as the long-term regular
    who offers perspective; burned bulgogi and incense/photograph indicate grief without
    naming it; final communal cooking and decision to move present a realistic hopeful
    ending. All six constraints are met (food symbolism appears multiple times; ancestral/ritual
    element beyond food; grief implied; specific estrangement cause; representative
    regular customer; hopeful-but-not-unrealistic ending). Minor critique: some emotional
    beats are slightly telling rather than fully dramatized, so narrative quality
    rated below exceptional.'
