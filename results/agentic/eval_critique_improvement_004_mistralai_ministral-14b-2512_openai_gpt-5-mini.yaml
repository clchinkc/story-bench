  evidence: 'Across revisions the author moved from telling to showing: V0 relied
    on explicit reflection and summary, V1 introduced sharper sensory anchors (the
    crack, hydrangeas, Brew & Bone), and the Final adds physical tells (trembling
    hands, rattling cup), concrete objects tied to Marjorie (stitched cap, hydrant),
    and a clearer arc of avoidance → small encounters → repeated choice of the new
    path. These changes address many critiques about interiority and subtlety, tighten
    prose, and preserve the story''s quiet tone. Remaining issues: occasional repeating
    phrases (“He thought of…”) and some explicit internal summary still soften the
    otherwise effective embodied emotion.'
