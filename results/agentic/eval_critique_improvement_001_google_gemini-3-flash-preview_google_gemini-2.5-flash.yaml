  evidence: The critiques provided were all for 'constraint_satisfaction' and all
    gave high scores (0.9-1.0). However, the provided 'Version 0', 'Version 1', 'Version
    2', and 'Version 3' are all identical to the 'Final output'. This indicates that
    no revisions were actually made based on the critiques, or at least, no changes
    were reflected in the provided versions. Therefore, there is no demonstrable improvement
    trajectory or responsiveness to critique, as the text remained static. The final
    output does satisfy most constraints well, but the lack of actual revision means
    the 'improvement' metrics are low.
