  evidence: 'Across the listed revisions the opening paragraph and core setup remain
    largely unchanged, with the main gains appearing in the final version where Chloe''s
    presence, Marcus''s interior flicker, and a few concrete craft details are more
    clearly foregrounded. Strengths—specific comedy-craft language (MISDIRECT, RULE
    OF THREE, tags), the early laugh, and the theme voiced by a minor character—were
    preserved. However, changes are incremental rather than structural: emotional
    stakes are hinted at more vividly in the final pass (the choking-on-laughter memory,
    the crumpled script cut to the palm), but the Save-the-Cat beats are referenced
    more than fully enacted. Overall the revisions address some surface critiques
    (clarity of who sees Marcus, sharper craft details) but do not deeply rework pacing
    or beat execution, yielding modest improvement.'
