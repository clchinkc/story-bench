  evidence: 'V0 opened with a strong image but was fragmentary and largely expository.
    V1 and V2 preserved the opening voice while gradually adding sensory detail (parents''
    scent, pack), and the final version expands those seeds into a complete arc: Mr.
    Henderson''s gentle push, the concrete grandmother scene with paperwork and the
    photograph that triggers Mateo''s insight, and the tangible action of applying
    and requesting a recommendation. Each revision retained the initial tone and setting
    while adding the crucial emotional beats and a clear earned resolution.'
