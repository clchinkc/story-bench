  evidence: 'The plan addresses all constraints and beats. The plan is specific enough
    to guide the writing, though some details (like the exact nature of the mentor''s
    unconventionality) are left to the execution. The final output adheres perfectly
    to the plan. All constraints are satisfied: Yuki''s isolation is shown through
    her actions (back to room, earbuds, precise movements, ''people are noise'');
    the alien signal is genuinely alien (phase-shifting lattice, non-primes, orbital
    periods); Rafael challenges Yuki''s approach (''purity is not accuracy'', ''let
    your elegant algorithms stare''); Inga is an unconventional mentor (maintenance
    worker, uses a cup and wrench, speaks in riddles); the threshold is psychological
    (opening her chest, letting others in); and the protein bar moment is a genuine,
    surprising human connection. All beats are executed: Call to Adventure (arrival
    of signal, Bright saying ''You''re lead''), Refusal of the Call (Yuki''s focus
    on code, ''I don''t do elegant'', ''people are noise''), Meeting the Mentor (Inga
    in the service tunnel), Crossing the Threshold (Yuki''s internal shift, ''Because
    I can''t hear it unless I let you in''). The narrative quality is excellent, with
    strong characterization, effective pacing, and a compelling resolution.'
