  evidence: The initial versions were very short, only covering the first few lines.
    The final output is a complete narrative that addresses most of the constraints.
    The revisions primarily involved adding more content to build out the story, rather
    than refining existing text. The core elements from the initial snippet (Mateo
    at the store, the woman's comment) were preserved and integrated into the larger
    story. The final output successfully introduces Mateo's internal conflict, a specific
    moment with his grandmother, and authentic cultural elements. The resolution is
    not fully present in the provided text, as it cuts off before Mateo makes a definitive
    choice, thus not fully earning the resolution through his growth. One adult (Mr.
    Herrera) genuinely understands Mateo's dilemma, but his role is minor.
