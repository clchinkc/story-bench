  evidence: 'Across the three revision passes the author clearly responded to feedback
    while retaining the story''s strengths. Early versions established setting and
    the Tide Keeper but felt flatter; by the final pass sensory detail was added (wet
    feet, salt, howling wind), the storm sequence and collapsing building amplified
    real danger, and Harkin''s cynicism was emphasized (his dismissive lines, folded
    map reveal) to make his specific flaw explicit. The Tide Keeper remains a believable,
    jury-rigged invention tied to Zara''s resourcefulness. Critiques about Zara''s
    voice were partially addressed: dialogue and short exclamations read convincingly
    12-year-old, but occasional interior phrasing still skews slightly mature (e.g.,
    "the way adults did when...", more reflective lines). Hero''s Journey beats are
    present and coherent (call, cynic mentor, crossing into danger, ordeal, reward,
    return) though a couple beats (e.g., an explicit internal refusal or deeper mentor
    instruction) could be stronger. Overall improvements are evident, strengths were
    preserved, and remaining work is mainly tightening internal voice and sharpening
    a couple transitional beats.'
