    STORY THEORY: Story Circle


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker
    who has

    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for

    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.


    - Central conflict: When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will
    take 6 months,

    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting

    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.


    - Tone: Quietly profound, observant, gently humorous


    REQUIRED BEATS: You (comfort zone), Need (want something), Go (unfamiliar situation),
    Search (adapt to it)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Teddy''s routine must be shown with specific, loving detail

    - The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been avoiding

    - Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s

    - Teddy''s late wife must be present through absence

    - The new path must offer something the old path couldn''t


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - character_interiority: Is Teddy''s inner life rich and specific?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Story Circle beats properly executed?

    - subtlety: Are emotions conveyed through action and detail, not exposition?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and resonance

  content: '# The Route That Wasn’t There


    At 6:20, Theodore Washington steps off his porch into a morning that still smells
    faintly of rain even when it’s not raining. He wears the same blue windbreaker,
    the same shoes with the scuff he refuses to sand down, the same watch that keeps
    time like a good letter. He knows the crack that runs like a river across the
    sidewalk at 1123 Oak; he steps over it without looking. He nods to Mr. Alvarez
    watering his lawn with a hose that leaks like a secret. He pauses at the corner
    by the corner store where the owner ties his tie while counting change, and at
    the little brick house with the blue door that always needs repainting. He checks
    the mailbox at 1450 Maple even though he stopped delivering mail six years ago;
    he likes to see what people are ordering from the world.


    Teddy’s route is three miles, measured in the rhythm of his feet and the way his
    shoulders loosen when the first bus hums past. He watches the sky lighten above
    the old brick factory, the way the sun catches the new windows in the renovated
    townhouse, the way the demolition crew stacks boards and tosses jokes. He passes
    the house that used to belong to the widow with the dog and the perfect garden;
    now it belongs to a family with two bikes and a chalk drawing on the sidewalk:
    a rocket ship with three seats.


    He walks, and the neighborhood breathes with him. He knows which porch lights
    stay on too late and which ones go off too early. He knows the woman who walks
    her dog at 6:30 and the man who jogs without a shirt even in winter. He knows
    the crack in the curb that collects puddles, the tree that drops seeds like pennies
    in late summer, the way the wind changes when the old gas station closes and the
    new coffee shop opens. He knows the faces that used to smile and the ones that
    still do.


    This morning, the barricade sits across his usual path like a wall at the edge
    of a story. Orange cones. A sign that says DETOUR: 6 MONTHS. The construction
    man, a kid with a hard hat and a softer voice, shrugs and says, “New water lines,
    sir. It’ll be done by fall.”


    Teddy looks at the cones. He looks at the familiar houses on the other side, the
    ones he’s been counting for forty years, and for the first time he feels the weight
    of that counting. He feels the tightness in his chest that he’s kept folded in
    his pocket, the way he’s been breathing around the empty chair at breakfast, the
    way he’s been stepping around the mug in the sink that still has a faint ring
    of coffee. He doesn’t say any of that. He nods, says “Okay,” and turns.


    He takes the unfamiliar street that runs along the river. The houses are newer,
    the lawns still trying to decide what they want to be. He passes the coffee shop
    with the green awning and the chalkboard that lists drinks like poems. He pauses
    at a small community garden tucked between two buildings. A woman in a worn cardigan
    is watering the tomatoes, her hands moving like a prayer. She looks up, and the
    smile she gives him is the kind that says, I’m here too.


    “You’re not lost,” she says.


    “No,” he says. “I’m taking a detour.”


    She nods as if that makes sense. “I’m Delia. I’ve been meaning to ask someone
    about the roses. They look unhappy.”


    Teddy kneels, and he finds the rose stems thin and brittle. He points to the soil,
    says, “Too much water and not enough sun. You want to move them to the corner
    where the light hits in the afternoon. Or prune them back and start fresh.”


    “Start fresh,” she says, and her eyes flick to a small bicycle leaning against
    the fence, the training wheels still on. “My granddaughter is learning. She wants
    to go to the park. I want to give her something that doesn’t die.”


    Teddy thinks about Lena, who always planted marigolds in the summer and said,
    They’re stubborn, like us. He thinks about the way he’s been stepping around grief
    like a crack in the sidewalk. He thinks about how the old route has protected
    him from feeling anything new, and how the new route has brought him to a woman
    with dirt on her hands and a story he can help with.


    He helps her move the roses. He finds a spot where the sun is generous and the
    soil is kind. He helps her prune, and the air smells like green and clean. He
    watches the granddaughter pedal slowly around the garden, laughing when the bike
    wobbles, and he feels something loosen in his chest. He walks the rest of the
    route, slower than usual, and he counts fewer houses. He passes the new coffee
    shop and thinks, Maybe. He thinks about how the old route was a map of what he
    already knew, and how the new route is a map of what he can learn.


    When he gets home, he makes coffee. He doesn’t put Lena’s mug in the sink. He
    puts it on the table, and he sits. He breathes, and the morning is quiet and kind.
    He thinks about the garden, about the roses, about the girl with the training
    wheels. He thinks about how the detour will end in six months, and how he'

    At 6:20, Theodore Washington steps off his porch into a morning that still smells
    faintly of rain even when it''s not raining. He wears the same blue windbreaker,
    the same shoes with the scuff he refuses to sand down, the same watch that keeps
    time like a good letter. He knows the crack that runs like a river across the
    sidewalk at 1123 Oak; he steps over it without looking. He nods to Mr. Alvarez
    watering his lawn with a hose that leaks like a secret. He pauses at the corner
    by the corner store where the owner ties his tie while counting change, and at
    the little brick house with the blue door that always needs repainting. He checks
    the mailbox at 1450 Maple even though he stopped delivering mail six years ago;
    he likes to see what people are ordering from the world.


    Teddy''s route is three miles, measured in the rhythm of his feet and the way
    his shoulders loosen when the first bus hums past. He watches the sky lighten
    above the old brick factory, the way the sun catches the new windows in the renovated
    townhouse, the way the demolition crew stacks boards and tosses jokes. He passes
    the house that used to belong to the widow with the dog and the perfect garden;
    now it belongs to a family with two bikes and a chalk drawing on the sidewalk:
    a rocket ship with three seats.


    He walks, and the neighborhood breathes with him. He knows which porch lights
    stay on too late and which ones go off too early. He knows the woman who walks
    her dog at 6:30 and the man who jogs without a shirt even in winter. He knows
    the crack in the curb that collects puddles, the tree that drops seeds like pennies
    in late summer, the way the wind changes when the old gas station closes and the
    new coffee shop opens. He knows the faces that used to smile and the ones that
    still do.


    But this morning, as he rounds the corner toward the coffee shop, he finds himself
    thinking about the empty chair at breakfast, about Lena''s reading glasses folded
    on the nightstand, about how he hasn''t spoken to a neighbor in weeks unless they
    spoke first. He thinks about how his days have become a series of tasks completed
    in silence, how he misses the weight of conversation, the way Lena used to ask
    about his walk and really listen to the answer. He wants—not consciously, but
    in the way bones want calcium—something to break the surface of his solitude.


    This morning, the barricade sits across his usual path like a wall at the edge
    of a story. Orange cones. A sign that says DETOUR: 6 MONTHS. The construction
    man, a kid with a hard hat and a softer voice, shrugs and says, "New water lines,
    sir. It''ll be done by fall."


    Teddy looks at the cones. He looks at the familiar houses on the other side, the
    ones he''s been counting for forty years, and he thinks, Six months. Six months
    of not knowing what I''ll see. Six months of not knowing what I''ll say to anyone.
    Six months of walking past the widow''s old house and feeling the absence of her
    dog barking. He doesn''t say any of that. He nods, says "Okay," and turns, but
    his chest feels tight with something that isn''t just the detour.


    He takes the unfamiliar street that runs along the river. The houses are newer,
    the lawns still trying to decide what they want to be. He passes the coffee shop
    with the green awning and the chalkboard that lists drinks like poems. He pauses
    at a small community garden tucked between two buildings. A woman in a worn cardigan
    is watering the tomatoes, her hands moving like a prayer. She looks up, and the
    smile she gives him is the kind that says, I''m here too.


    "You''re not lost," she says.


    "No," he says. "I''m taking a detour."


    She nods as if that makes sense. "I''m Delia. I''ve been meaning to ask someone
    about the roses. They look unhappy."


    Teddy kneels, and he finds the rose stems thin and brittle. He points to the soil,
    says, "Too much water and not enough sun. You want to move them to the corner
    where the light hits in the afternoon. Or prune them back and start fresh."


    "Start fresh," she says, and her eyes flick to a small bicycle leaning against
    the fence, the training wheels still on. "My granddaughter is learning. She wants
    to go to the park. I want to give her something that doesn''t die."


    Teddy thinks about Lena''s marigolds, how she planted them every June and said,
    They''re stubborn, like us. He thinks about how he''s been stepping around grief
    like a crack in the sidewalk, how he''s been living in the spaces between memories
    instead of making new ones. He helps her move the roses, finds a spot where the
    sun is generous and the soil is kind. He helps her prune, and the air smells like
    green and clean. He watches the granddaughter pedal slowly around the garden,
    laughing when the bike wobbles, and he feels something loosen in his chest.


    When he gets home, he makes coffee. He doesn''t put Lena''s mug in the sink. He
    puts it on the table, next to his own, and he sits. He breathes, and the morning
    is quiet and kind. He thinks about the garden, about Delia''s hands in the soil,
    about the girl with the training wheels. He thinks about how the detour will end
    in six months, and how he will keep walking this new route anyway, because sometimes
    what breaks you open is exactly what you needed to find.'

    \ at 1123 Oak; he steps over it without looking. He nods to Mr. Alvarez watering\
    \ his lawn with a hose that leaks like a secret. He pauses at the corner by the\
    \ corner store where the owner ties his tie while counting change, and at the\
    \ little brick house with the blue door that always needs repainting. He checks\

    \ he likes to see what people are ordering from the world.\n\nTeddy's route is\
    \ three miles, measured in the rhythm of his feet and the way his shoulders loosen\
    \ when the first bus hums past. He watches the sky lighten above the old brick\

    \ the way the demolition crew stacks boards and tosses jokes. He passes the house\
    \ that used to belong to the widow with the dog and the perfect garden; now it\
    \ belongs to a family with two bikes and a chalk drawing on the sidewalk: a rocket\
    \ ship with three seats.\n\nHe walks, and the neighborhood breathes with him.\
    \ He knows which porch lights stay on too late and which ones go off too early.\
    \ He knows the woman who walks her dog at 6:30 and the man who jogs without a\
    \ shirt even in winter. He knows the crack in the curb that collects puddles,\
    \ the tree that drops seeds like pennies in late summer, the way the wind changes\
    \ when the old gas station closes and the new coffee shop opens. He knows the\
    \ faces that used to smile and the ones that still do.\n\nBut this morning, as\
    \ he rounds the corner toward the coffee shop, he finds himself thinking about\
    \ the empty chair at breakfast, about Lena's reading glasses folded on the nightstand,\
    \ about how he hasn't spoken to a neighbor in weeks unless they spoke first. He\
    \ thinks about how his days have become a series of tasks completed in silence,\
    \ how he misses the weight of conversation, the way Lena used to ask about his\
    \ walk and really listen to the answer. He wants—not consciously, but in the way\
    \ bones want calcium—something to break the surface of his solitude.\n\nThis morning,\
    \ the barricade sits across his usual path like a wall at the edge of a story.\
    \ Orange cones. A sign that says DETOUR: 6 MONTHS. The construction man, a kid\
    \ with a hard hat and a softer voice, shrugs and says, \"New water lines, sir.\
    \ It'll be done by fall.\"\n\nTeddy looks at the cones. He looks at the familiar\
    \ houses on the other side, the ones he's been counting for forty years, and he\
    \ thinks, Six months. Six months of not knowing what I'll see. Six months of not\
    \ knowing what I'll say to anyone. Six months of walking past the widow's old\
    \ house and feeling the absence of her dog barking. He doesn't say any of that.\
    \ He nods, says \"Okay,\" and turns, but his chest feels tight with something\
    \ that isn't just the detour.\n\nHe takes the unfamiliar street that runs along\
    \ the river. The houses are newer, the lawns still trying to decide what they\
    \ want to be. He passes the coffee shop with the green awning and the chalkboard\
    \ that lists drinks like poems. He pauses at a small community garden tucked between\
    \ two buildings. A woman in a worn cardigan is watering the tomatoes, her hands\
    \ moving like a prayer. She looks up, and the smile she gives him is the kind\
    \ that says, I'm here too.\n\n\"You're not lost,\" she says.\n\n\"No,\" he says.\
    \ \"I'm taking a detour.\"\n\nShe nods as if that makes sense. \"I'm Delia. I've\
    \ been meaning to ask someone about the roses. They look unhappy.\"\n\nTeddy kneels,\
    \ and he finds the rose stems thin and brittle. He points to the soil, says, \"\
    Too much water and not enough sun. You want to move them to the corner where the\
    \ light hits in the afternoon. Or prune them back and start fresh.\"\n\n\"Start\
    \ fresh,\" she says, and her eyes flick to a small bicycle leaning against the\
    \ fence, the training wheels still on. \"My granddaughter is learning. She wants\
    \ to go to the park. I want to give her something that doesn't die.\"\n\nTeddy\
    \ thinks about Lena's marigolds, how she planted them every June and said, They're\
    \ stubborn, like us. He thinks about how he's been stepping around grief like\
    \ a crack in the sidewalk, how he's been living in the spaces between memories\
    \ instead of making new ones. He helps her move the roses, finds a spot where\
    \ the sun is generous and the soil is kind. He helps her prune, and the air smells\
    \ like green and clean. He watches the granddaughter pedal slowly around the garden,\
    \ laughing when the bike wobbles, and he feels something loosen in his chest.\n\
    \nWhen he gets home, he makes coffee. He doesn't put Lena's mug in the sink. He\
    \ puts it on the table, next to his own, and he sits. He breathes, and the morning\
    \ is quiet and kind. He thinks about the garden, about Delia's hands in the soil,\
    \ about the girl with the training wheels. He thinks about how the detour will\
    \ end in six months, and how he will keep walking this new route anyway, because\
    \ sometimes what breaks you open is exactly what you needed to find.\n\nEDITOR'S\

    At 6:20, Theodore Washington steps off his porch into a morning that still smells
    faintly of rain even when it’s not raining. He wears the same blue windbreaker,
    the same shoes with the scuff he refuses to sand down, the same watch that keeps
    time like a good letter. He knows the crack that runs like a river across the
    sidewalk at 1123 Oak; he steps over it without looking. He nods to Mr. Alvarez
    watering his lawn with a hose that leaks like a secret. He pauses at the corner
    by the corner store where the owner ties his tie while counting change, and at
    the little brick house with the blue door that always needs repainting. He checks
    the mailbox at 1450 Maple even though he stopped delivering mail six years ago;
    he likes to see what people are ordering from the world.


    Teddy’s route is three miles, measured in the rhythm of his feet and the way his
    shoulders loosen when the first bus hums past. He watches the sky lighten above
    the old brick factory, the way the sun catches the new windows in the renovated
    townhouse, the way the demolition crew stacks boards and tosses jokes. He passes
    the house that used to belong to the widow with the dog and the perfect garden;
    now it belongs to a family with two bikes and a chalk drawing on the sidewalk:

    new coffee shop opens. He knows the faces that used to smile and the ones that
    still do.


    But this morning, as he rounds the corner toward the coffee shop, he finds himself
    pausing at the empty chair at breakfast, where he has set two plates for forty
    years and then removed one. He picks up Lena’s reading glasses from the nightstand,
    folds them carefully, and places them back, as if she might need them later. He
    listens to the silence in the kitchen, the way the clock ticks louder when there’s
    no conversation, and he feels a tug in his chest that isn’t the weight of his
    bag. He wants—though he doesn’t name it—something to break the surface of his
    solitude, a reason to speak to a stranger, a chance to feel useful again.


    This morning, the barricade sits across his usual path like a wall at the edge
    of a story. Orange cones. A sign that says DETOUR: 6 MONTHS. The construction
    man, a kid with a hard hat and a softer voice, shrugs and says, “New water lines,
    sir. It’ll be done by fall.”

  content: '# The Route That Wasn''t There


    At 6:20, Theodore Washington steps off his porch into a morning that smells faintly
    of rain even when it isn’t raining. He wears the same blue windbreaker, the same
    scuffed shoes, the same watch that ticks with the dependable cadence of his old
    route. He knows the crack that runs like a river across the sidewalk at 1123 Oak;
    he steps over it without looking. He nods to Mr. Alvarez watering his lawn with
    a hose that leaks like a secret. He pauses at the corner by the corner store where
    the owner ties his tie while counting change, and at the little brick house with
    the blue door that always needs repainting. He checks the mailbox at 1450 Maple,
    though he hasn’t delivered mail in six years; he likes to see what people are
    ordering from the world.


    Teddy’s route is three miles, measured in the rhythm of his feet and the way his
    shoulders loosen when the first bus hums past. He watches the sky lighten above
    the old brick factory, the way the sun catches the new windows in the renovated
    townhouse, the way the demolition crew stacks boards and tosses jokes. He passes
    the house that used to belong to the widow with the dog and the perfect garden;
    now it belongs to a family with two bikes and a chalk drawing on the sidewalk:
    a rocket ship with three seats.


    He walks, and the neighborhood unfolds around him. He knows which porch lights
    stay on too late and which ones go off too early. He knows the woman who walks
    her dog at 6:30 and the man who jogs without a shirt even in winter. He knows
    the crack in the curb that collects puddles, the tree that drops seeds like pennies
    in late summer, the way the wind changes when the old gas station closes and the
    new coffee shop opens. He knows the faces that used to smile and the ones that
    still do.


    But this morning, as he rounds the corner toward the coffee shop, he finds himself
    pausing at the empty chair at breakfast, where he has set two plates for forty
    years and then removed one. He picks up Lena’s reading glasses from the nightstand,
    folds them carefully, and places them back, as if she might need them later. He
    listens to the silence in the kitchen, the way the clock ticks louder when there’s
    no conversation, and he feels a tug in his chest that isn’t the weight of his
    bag. He wants—though he doesn’t name it—something to break the surface of his
    solitude, a reason to speak to a stranger, a chance to feel useful again.


    This morning, the barricade sits across his usual path like a wall at the edge
    of a story. Orange cones. A sign that says DETOUR: 6 MONTHS. The construction
    man, a kid with a hard hat and a softer voice, shrugs and says, “New water lines,
    sir. It’ll be done by fall.”


    Teddy looks at the cones. He looks at the familiar houses on the other side, the
    ones he’s been counting for forty years, and he thinks, *Six months.* *Six months
    of not knowing what I’ll see.* *Six months of walking past the widow’s old house
    and feeling the absence of her dog barking.* He doesn’t say any of that. He nods,
    says “Okay,” and turns, but his chest feels tight with something that isn’t just
    the detour.


    He takes the unfamiliar street that runs along the river. The houses are newer,
    the lawns still trying to decide what they want to be. He passes the coffee shop
    with the green awning and the chalkboard that lists drinks like poems. He pauses
    at a small community garden tucked between two buildings. A woman in a worn cardigan
    is watering the tomatoes, her hands moving like a prayer. She looks up, and the
    smile she gives him is the kind that says, *I’m here too.*


    “You’re not lost,” she says.


    “No,” he says. “I’m taking a detour.”


    She nods as if that makes sense. “I’m Delia. I’ve been meaning to ask someone
    about the roses. They look unhappy.”


    Teddy kneels, and he finds the rose stems thin and brittle. He points to the soil,
    says, “Too much water and not enough sun. You want to move them to the corner
    where the light hits in the afternoon. Or prune them back and start fresh.”


    “Start fresh,” she says, and her eyes flick to a small bicycle leaning against
    the fence, the training wheels still on. “My granddaughter is learning. She wants
    to go to the park. I want to give her something that doesn’t die.”


    Teddy thinks about Lena’s marigolds, how she planted them every June and said,
    *They’re stubborn, like us.* He thinks about how he’s been stepping around grief
    like a crack in the sidewalk, how he’s been living in the spaces between memories
    instead of making new ones. He helps her move the roses, finds a spot where the
    sun is generous and the soil is kind. He helps her prune, and the air smells like
    green and clean. He watches the granddaughter pedal slowly around the garden,
    laughing when the bike wobbles, and he feels something loosen in his chest.


    On his way home, he encounters Mr. Alvarez by the hydrangeas. The old man’s shoulders
    sag more than they used to. “Teddy,” he says, and his voice is rough with something
    that might be grief. “I heard about the detour. I thought maybe… you’d walk this
    way sometimes now?”


    Teddy nods. “I might.”


    Mr. Alvarez’s eyes are wet. “I miss her,” he says suddenly. “Lena. She always
    waved when she saw me. Even when she was tired. Especially then.”


    Teddy feels his own throat tighten. “She liked your hose,” he manages. “Said it
    was honest.”


    They stand among the hydrangeas, and the morning is quiet except for the distant
    hum of construction and the soft sound of water leaking from the hose. Mr. Alvarez
    wipes his eyes with the back of his hand. “Come by after your walk,” he says.
    “I have pictures of the block from thirty years ago. Lena’s in them. You might
    like to see.”


    When Teddy gets home, he makes coffee. He doesn’t put Lena’s mug in the sink.
    He puts it on the table, next to his own, and he sits. He breathes, and the morning
    is quiet and kind. He thinks about the garden, about Delia’s hands in the soil,
    about Mr. Alvarez’s hydrangeas and the pictures he wants to share. He thinks about
    how the detour will end in six months, and how he will keep walking this new route
    anyway, because sometimes what breaks you open is exactly what you needed to find.
    He thinks about the marigolds he will plant next spring, stubborn and bright,
    and about the way Lena’s voice used to fill the kitchen, and how maybe, slowly,
    he can learn to fill it again.'

final_output: '# The Route That Wasn''t There


  At 6:20, Theodore Washington steps off his porch into a morning that smells faintly
  of rain even when it isn’t raining. He wears the same blue windbreaker, the same
  scuffed shoes, the same watch that ticks with the dependable cadence of his old
  route. He knows the crack that runs like a river across the sidewalk at 1123 Oak;
  he steps over it without looking. He nods to Mr. Alvarez watering his lawn with
  a hose that leaks like a secret. He pauses at the corner by the corner store where
  the owner ties his tie while counting change, and at the little brick house with
  the blue door that always needs repainting. He checks the mailbox at 1450 Maple,
  though he hasn’t delivered mail in six years; he likes to see what people are ordering
  from the world.


  Teddy’s route is three miles, measured in the rhythm of his feet and the way his
  shoulders loosen when the first bus hums past. He watches the sky lighten above
  the old brick factory, the way the sun catches the new windows in the renovated
  townhouse, the way the demolition crew stacks boards and tosses jokes. He passes
  the house that used to belong to the widow with the dog and the perfect garden;
  now it belongs to a family with two bikes and a chalk drawing on the sidewalk: a
  rocket ship with three seats.


  He walks, and the neighborhood unfolds around him. He knows which porch lights stay
  on too late and which ones go off too early. He knows the woman who walks her dog
  at 6:30 and the man who jogs without a shirt even in winter. He knows the crack
  in the curb that collects puddles, the tree that drops seeds like pennies in late
  summer, the way the wind changes when the old gas station closes and the new coffee
  shop opens. He knows the faces that used to smile and the ones that still do.


  But this morning, as he rounds the corner toward the coffee shop, he finds himself
  pausing at the empty chair at breakfast, where he has set two plates for forty years
  and then removed one. He picks up Lena’s reading glasses from the nightstand, folds
  them carefully, and places them back, as if she might need them later. He listens
  to the silence in the kitchen, the way the clock ticks louder when there’s no conversation,
  and he feels a tug in his chest that isn’t the weight of his bag. He wants—though
  he doesn’t name it—something to break the surface of his solitude, a reason to speak
  to a stranger, a chance to feel useful again.


  This morning, the barricade sits across his usual path like a wall at the edge of
  a story. Orange cones. A sign that says DETOUR: 6 MONTHS. The construction man,
  a kid with a hard hat and a softer voice, shrugs and says, “New water lines, sir.
  It’ll be done by fall.”


  Teddy looks at the cones. He looks at the familiar houses on the other side, the
  ones he’s been counting for forty years, and he thinks, *Six months.* *Six months
  of not knowing what I’ll see.* *Six months of walking past the widow’s old house
  and feeling the absence of her dog barking.* He doesn’t say any of that. He nods,
  says “Okay,” and turns, but his chest feels tight with something that isn’t just
  the detour.


  He takes the unfamiliar street that runs along the river. The houses are newer,
  the lawns still trying to decide what they want to be. He passes the coffee shop
  with the green awning and the chalkboard that lists drinks like poems. He pauses
