  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Revisions show deliberate refinement. V0→V1 tightens sensory
    specificity (window unit ''wheezed'' vs ''battled''; ''baking sheet'' vs generic
    ''tray''). V1→V2 adds temporal consistency (''same light'' for Civic). V2→V3 introduces
    crucial audio detail (''plink-plink'' dripping, cumin scent) and refines Imani''s
    tactile relationship with her equipment (''shallow groove she''d scratched'').
    Final output expands substantially with full narrative arc, maintaining all improvements
    while adding character depth and plot momentum. Quality escalates meaningfully
    without losing earlier gains.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Non-visual sensory details PROMINENT: Exceptional
    execution—heat as ''damp palm,'' coconut hair oil smell, foam warmth, fridge muttering,
    toddler''s plastic percussion, motion-sensor whine, breath snagging, throat clicking,
    wet asphalt scraping, fabric rasping, beeping patterns. (2) Blindness as STRENGTH:
    Imani''s audio analysis outpaces trained detective; her listening skills solve
    what visual investigation missed; she navigates space with practiced efficiency;
    her podcast success (''top fifty'') establishes credibility independent of sight.
    (3) SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE crucial: Three-beep pattern becomes investigative lynchpin—Imani
    identifies it as anomalous, uses it to redirect Wolfe''s attention, becomes evidence
    of tampering/cover-up. (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION: Wolfe''s initial condescension
    (''not exactly trained,'' ''ma''am,'' dismissive tone) contrasts sharply with
    his growing respect as Imani demonstrates superior analytical skills. (5) FUN
    AND GAMES genuinely entertaining: Empanada banter, her podcast roast of Dante,
    verbal sparring with Wolfe (''autograph'' quip, ''people'' challenge), the satisfying
    rhythm of collaborative problem-solving—all entertaining before the rug pulls
    with ''Emergency permit'' and destroyed footage.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Opening establishes Imani''s sensory world with precision. Inciting
    incident (body in alley) arrives organically through Dante''s call. Detective
    arrival triggers underestimation beat cleanly. Investigation sequence builds momentum
    with genuine detective-work satisfaction. Tonal shift to darkness lands hard with
    permit revelation and missing footage—the ''fun'' genuinely ends. Pacing accelerates
    appropriately.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Voice is distinctive and confident. Dialogue crackles with
    personality. Sensory writing avoids cliché (coconut oil detail, plink-plink dripping,
    Civic''s cough). Character dynamics feel earned rather than imposed. The mystery
    setup is compelling without feeling contrived. Imani''s competence reads as authentic
    rather than performative. Ending leaves reader wanting next chapter.'
