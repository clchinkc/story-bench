  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer maintained core strengths (methodical
    action sequences, fog integration) while addressing implicit critique concerns
    about depth. Versions 1-3 show stabilization rather than radical revision—suggesting
    either early excellence or incomplete engagement with critique nuance. The final
    output adds psychological weight (Boston PD callback, Aaron Bell revelation) that
    earlier critiques didn''t explicitly demand but clearly valued. Score reduced
    from perfect due to minimal structural changes across versions.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0→V1 introduces Maeve and establishes interpersonal tension
    (+0.15 quality gain). V1→V2→V3 show near-identical text, indicating plateau. However,
    the final output demonstrates cumulative refinement: tighter sensory details (grit
    analysis, twine observation), deeper character secrets (Maeve''s damp cuffs, Greg''s
    dry boots), and stronger past-case integration (Aaron Bell as specific anchor
    to Boston trauma). The trajectory is steady rather than dramatic, suggesting the
    writer was already executing well.


    PRESERVATION: Exceptional. The fog metaphor (''gray tide,'' ''swallowing the harbor'')
    persists unchanged—correctly identified as working. Sarah''s methodical counting
    (buoy intervals, tide tables, stride measurement) remains the narrative spine.
    The opening image, Maeve''s introduction, and sensory specificity all survive
    intact. New material (body discovery, evidence handling, character secrets) layers
    atop rather than replacing, creating accretion rather than disruption.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5):

    1. Methodical nature through action: SATISFIED (0.95). ''Pencil hovering, then
    wrote the interval,'' ''measured distance by stride,'' ''crouched, extended a
    hooked pole,'' ''practiced rhythm,'' ''tapping the sealed evidence bag twice''—all
    demonstrate obsessive precision through behavior, not exposition.

    2. Fog serves narrative purpose: SATISFIED (0.96). Fog enables secrets (''folding
    sound into secrecy''), obscures evidence (''erasing his shoulders''), creates
    psychological pressure (''fog pressed close, swallowing the harbor''s edges''),
    and literally shields Sarah''s decision (''It was a shield if she wanted it, and
    a blind if she didn''t'').

    3. Local character with secret: SATISFIED (0.93). Maeve (damp cuffs despite claiming
    fog keeps her ashore), Greg (dry boots on wet wood, green-stained twine, evasive
    about night runs). Both harbor secrets; Maeve''s is more developed.

    4. Past case hinted before revealed: SATISFIED (0.94). ''She was thinking of another
    harbor, another morning, a knot she''d misread'' (line 8) precedes Aaron Bell
    identification by ~800 words. The double constrictor knot callback (''girl died
    with a double constrictor knot'') creates elegant callback.

    5. End on decision, not resolution: SATISFIED (0.95). Final image: ''Her thumb
    hovered over two numbers in her recent calls: the Boston task force, or no one
    at all. In the muffled harbor, she brought the phone to her ear.'' Ambiguous choice,
    unresolved tension.


    BEAT EXECUTION (3 required beats, all present):

    1. Establish Sarah''s methodology: EXECUTED (0.92). Opening 400 words establish
    baseline-counting, tide-table cross-referencing, environmental reading. Methodical
    voice established before body appears.

    2. Introduce complication/mystery: EXECUTED (0.90). Body discovery, evidence collection,
    then Aaron Bell revelation creates escalating stakes. The knot reference ties
    to Sarah''s trauma.

    3. Force decision point: EXECUTED (0.88). Phone call choice (Boston task force
    vs. silence) is genuine dilemma with no clear answer. Slightly weakened by ambiguity
    of which number she actually calls, but that ambiguity may be intentional.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: 0.92

    STRENGTHS: Prose is precise and sensory-rich. Metaphors work (''fog moved like
    a living thing,'' ''knot she''d misread''). Character voice is distinct—Sarah''s
    internal rhythm matches her external precision. Dialogue feels natural (Maeve''s
    ''You could just ask me,'' Greg''s evasion). The reveal of Aaron Bell lands with
    genuine weight because the groundwork was laid early.


    WEAKNESSES: Minor—the final phone call is slightly undercooked. ''She brought
    the phone to her ear'' doesn''t clarify which number she dialed, which could read
    as writerly evasion rather than intentional ambiguity. The transition from body
    discovery to character interrogation is slightly rushed (Bennett''s ID reveal
    happens very quickly). Greg''s characterization could be sharper—his motivation
    for secrecy is less clear than Maeve''s.


    OVERALL: This is strong work that successfully navigates all constraints while
    maintaining literary quality. The revision process shows stability rather than
    transformation, suggesting the writer had strong instincts from V0. The final
    output is cohesive, atmospheric, and psychologically complex.'
