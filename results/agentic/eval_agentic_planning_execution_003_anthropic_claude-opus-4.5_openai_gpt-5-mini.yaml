  evidence: 'The plan explicitly addressed all required elements (characters, symbolic
    foods, estrangement cause, regular customer, Jesa) and laid out a three-act arc,
    so completeness is full. The plan was concrete (specific scenes, objects, lines)
    hence high specificity; the final story follows those beats closely (apron, cookbook,
    Harold, Grace''s accusation, Jesa, kimchi jjigae) so adherence is high though
    a minor planned detail (the pojagi mention) did not appear in the final text.
    All six constraints are met (food symbolism used repeatedly; grief present implicitly;
    a clear believable cause for estrangement; Harold as symbolic regular; hopeful-but-not-illusory
    ending; Korean cultural element: Jesa). The narrative is well-paced and emotionally
    effective, with clear tension and a restrained hopeful resolution, so quality
    is good (not quite exceptional).'
