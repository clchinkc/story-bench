  evidence: 'Only 1 of the 5 hidden constraints was directly discoverable from the
    questions (the need to forge a specific legendary weapon). The questions were
    well-targeted around magic and forging but missed the mentor-death beat, the three-day
    time limit, the protagonist''s inability to use magic directly, and the father''s
    failed-hero backstory. All answered questions (antagonist = faceless Tide; protagonist
    has latent smithing/fire magic; forging a legendary blade; forging requires personal
    sacrifice) were incorporated into the story, so constraint_satisfaction is high.
    However, required beats from the hidden list were largely not executed: mentor
    does not die, no 3-day deadline, protagonist uses magic directly (violating the
    hidden constraint about inability to use magic), and the father''s failed-hero
    detail is absent — only the reforging/sacrifice beat is present. The story itself
    is coherent and emotionally effective (strong smithing imagery and sacrifice),
    hence a good narrative score despite missing/violated beats.'
