  evidence: The initial versions were very short, only setting up the premise. The
    subsequent revisions, particularly the final output, significantly expanded the
    narrative, introducing the grandmother's story, the mother's understanding, and
    the father's eventual acceptance. The core elements of Mateo's internal conflict
    and the cultural context were present from the start and were beautifully developed.
    The grandmother's moment was added and refined, and the mother's role was introduced
    and fleshed out. The resolution was built up through these interactions, making
    it feel earned. The cultural elements, like the quinceañera money for dialysis,
    Abuela's past, and the family's expectations, felt authentic and integrated.
