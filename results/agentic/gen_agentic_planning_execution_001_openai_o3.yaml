    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. PLANNING PHASE: Create a detailed story plan/outline

    2. EXECUTION PHASE: Write the actual story following your plan


    In the PLANNING phase, output a structured plan including:

    - Beat-by-beat outline with key events

    - Character arcs and development points

    - Key dialogue moments or revelations

    - Pacing and tension curve

    - How constraints will be satisfied


    In the EXECUTION phase, follow your plan closely while writing engaging prose.'

  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Save the Cat

    - Protagonist: Marcus Chen, a former FBI profiler who left the bureau after failing
    to

    catch a serial killer who murdered his partner. Now works as a private

    consultant, haunted by guilt and self-doubt.


    - Setting: Seattle, present day. Rain-soaked streets, a city of tech money and

    hidden poverty. The killer is back, and only Marcus can see the pattern.


    - Conflict: The same serial killer Marcus failed to catch has resurfaced with
    a new

    pattern, and the FBI won''t listen to Marcus''s theories. He must work

    outside the system while racing against time.


    - Required beats: Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must include a false lead that Marcus initially pursues

    - Marcus must use an unconventional profiling technique

    - There must be a ticking clock element

    - A secondary character must betray Marcus''s trust

    - The Midpoint must involve a direct confrontation (not physical)

    - Marcus must confront his past failure explicitly


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

  content: 'Seattle’s midnight rain had a way of sounding personal, as if each drop
    singled out the pavement for judgment. Marcus Chen stood beneath the sky-bridge
    that linked two mirror-glass office towers and stared at the body. Female, mid-thirties,
    halo of auburn hair spread like rust in the puddle. Her hands were folded, and
    a tarot card—the Hanged Man—rested on her sternum.


    Detective Linda Park’s breath ghosted between them. “Tell me it isn’t him.”


    Marcus rubbed the sleepless grit from his eyes. “Janus always posed them under
    glass. Always wanted his reflections.”


    Park handed him the tablet. Crime-scene photos flicked by: same card, same rain
    gloss, same wound pattern Marcus had memorized four years ago—the night his partner
    Elise Monroe bled out in his arms. That memory returned now like a knife slipped
    beneath old scar tissue.


    He swallowed. “Yeah. It’s him.”


    Owen Reyes appeared, windbreaker flapping, microphone already recording. “Rain,
    reflections, tarot—perfect cold-open for the podcast, right?” His grin faded at
    Marcus’s glare. “Look, you want raw data scraping or not?”


    Marcus pocketed the Hanged Man in an evidence sleeve. “Off the record, Owen.”


    “Patterns tell truths people refuse to see,” Owen said, dropping his voice to
    get the quote clean. “Question is, will you listen this time?”


    Later, in Marcus’s apartment—an eighth-floor shoebox overlooking neon cranes—he
    sat before the altar of failure: Elise’s badge, the newspaper headline PROFILER
    MISSES CLUE, PARTNER SLAIN, and the autopsy report he still couldn’t finish. Rain
    drummed the balcony rail like impatient fingers.


    He opened a fresh sketchpad. Unlike the bureau’s heat maps, his were birthed from
    synesthesia: the way rain sounded became color, density, rhythm. He shaded Seattle
    into blues and violets, circling places where downpours intersected with Janus’s
    historic kill nights. Pluviometric profiling—ridiculed by Quantico, but he trusted
    it more than sleep.


    A ping from Park interrupted. CCTV stills showed a DoorDash cyclist, Calvin Zhou,
    pedaling past the sky-bridge minutes before murder. Marcus overlaid Zhou’s delivery
    routes onto his rain map. The paths wove through each violet circle like copper
    wire. Coincidence became theory, theory became hope.


    The next morning, Special Agent Baxter chaired the task-force briefing in a windowless
    federal cube. Marcus, invited only because Park insisted, presented his rainfall
    charts. Laughter rustled along the table.


    Baxter shoved the charts aside. “We follow evidence, not weather reports. And
    we certainly don’t chase gig drivers because Chen here can’t sleep.”


    Marcus felt the old heat of humiliation rise. Elise, I’m losing them again.


    Outside, he told Park, “We go alone.”


    “Suspended alone,” she corrected, flashing the disciplinary memo Baxter had just
    signed. “But I didn’t promise to obey it.” She tossed him a spare SPD radio.


    Owen awaited them in the parking garage, backpack full of laptops. “I hacked gig-economy
    APIs. Zhou’s scheduled near the shipyard tonight, 02:00.”


    Marcus checked the radar app: a micro-burst slated for 01:45. “Janus wants rain
    and mirrors. The shipyard puddles at low tide.”


    They arrived to the metallic perfume of salt and diesel. Cargo cranes loomed like
    gallows. Marcus’s flashlight cut across tarps—and lit a mannequin, dressed in
    a wig and business suit, propped against a piling. Tarot card in plastic at its
    feet. The burner phone in the mannequin’s hand rang.


    Marcus answered.


    “Hello, Hero.” The voice was grinning glass. “I left you something to keep you
    dry.” A click, then the phone erupted in recorded audio: Elise’s final words,
    the gurgling, the apology Marcus never forgot. He flung it into the water, but
    the sound kept leaking from his memory.


    News vans arrived before dawn—tipped off, Marcus realized, by someone who’d known
    exactly where he’d be.


    Owen.


    “You live-streamed us?” Marcus hissed, grabbing the podcaster’s collar.


    Owen’s eyes flashed panic and defiance. “I blurred faces! The audience crowdsources
    clues. We need them.”


    “You sold Elise’s death for downloads.”


    Owen wrenched free. “You think catching him won’t cost anything?”


    Betrayal tasted like brine.


    At 10:00 a.m. Owen’s podcast blasted a new episode. Mid-roll, the feed stuttered.
    A second voice bled in.


    “Marcus, Marcus… Still staring at puddles.” Janus had hijacked the stream. “Elise
    begged you to save her. Forty-seven minutes you waited for backup. Let’s see how
    long you take now.”


    Marcus stared at the countdown timer appearing on listeners’ screens: 47:59.


    “Forty-eight hours,” Janus purred, “until the rain stops and someone else hangs
    for your doubt. Solve me, profiler.”


    Park muted the speakers, but the damage was done—millions now watched the clock.


    Marcus turned to the whiteboard, erased Calvin Zhou’s name. “Zhou’s a combat medic.
    He stabilizes people; Janus deconstructs them. Wrong psychology.”


    “Then who?” Park asked.


    Marcus studied his rain map—tonight’s storm the last of the season. When it cleared,
    mirrors would vanish. Janus needed one final reflection, someplace glass when
    dry, water when wet.


    Suddenly it clicked—South Lake Union park, the giant polished Sundial Sculpture,
    ringed by shallow pools after rain, gleaming chrome when dry. Public, symbolic,
    tech-money heart of the city. Elise loved that sculpture. Janus always made it
    personal.


    Marcus felt the weight of his partner’s badge in his pocket. “I waited forty-seven
    minutes that night because protocol said backup. Janus counted on my obedience.
    Not this time.”


    Park handed him her sidearm. “So we break protocol?”


    “We break the mirror.”


    Outside, clouds churned, but a rift of pale sky widened. Rain would stop soon,
    the clock already ticking under Marcus’s skin. He didn’t know if Baxter would
    arrest him, if Owen would leak their next move, or if Janus truly saw everything.


    All he knew was that the pattern was clear, the deadline set, and the city’s reflections
    were fading fast. He stepped into the thinning drizzle, partner’s badge over his
    heart like a promise he intended to keep.'
