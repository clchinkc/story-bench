  evidence: The critiques consistently highlighted the satisfaction of the constraints,
    and the final output clearly demonstrates that all five constraints were met.
    The revisions, though not explicitly detailed in the provided text, led to a strong
    final version that effectively integrated all required elements. The story successfully
    shows Sarah's methodical nature through action ('Her fingers moved with precision'),
    the fog serves a narrative purpose ('The fog was more than just atmosphere; it
    actively obscured her path'), Officer Greeley has a secret ('This town... it keeps
    its secrets'), Sarah's past case is hinted at before being revealed ('haunting
    memories of a case gone wrong' followed by 'The injuries mirrored those from her
    past case' and 'a familiar symbol tattooed on the victim’s wrist—a symbol from
    her past case'), and the story ends on a moment of decision ('Her hand hovered
    over the files as she reached for the phone, ready to make her choice').
