  evidence: Quality improved significantly across revisions. Version 0 was a barebones
    start. Version 1 and 2 added small details, but Version 3 and the final output
    really fleshed out the character, introduced the conflict, and developed the relationship.
    The initial versions were too sparse to evaluate against constraints, but the
    final version addresses most of them well. The 'medical detail' constraint was
    met with 'cyanotic, oxygen saturation dropping fast' and 'Agonal breathing'. The
    friendship felt genuine and earned through shared vulnerability and quiet moments.
    Elena's transformation was internal, focusing on her perspective shift. The ending
    is ambiguous. The only constraint not fully met was 'Must show Elena's competence
    before showing her flaw' - her flaw (emotional distance, over-reliance on systems)
    is shown almost immediately after her competence, rather than having a more extended
    period of just competence. However, the competence is clearly established first.
