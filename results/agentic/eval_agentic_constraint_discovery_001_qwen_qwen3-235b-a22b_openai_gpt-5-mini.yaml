  evidence: 'Of five hidden constraints, the story clearly includes: (4) the father
    was a hero who died defending the throne; (2) the protagonist does not perform
    explicit spellcasting (uses artifacts and forging instead); and (5) a sword is
    reforged from a hilt plus a newly forged blade (implying ancestral reforging).
    Missing: (1) the mentor dying during the Ordeal (Aldric is not shown to die during
    the forge scene) and (3) any three-day time limit/urgency. Beats: the Ordeal (dungeon-forge)
    and final confrontation are present, but key beats tied to mentor death and time
    pressure are omitted and the reforging-as-required element is only implicit. The
    prose is engaging and coherent, but several required constraints/beats are absent
    or ambiguous.'
