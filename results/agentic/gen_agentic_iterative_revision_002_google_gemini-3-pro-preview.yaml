  content: 'The humidity in Imani’s Bed-Stuy apartment wasn''t just heat; it was a
    physical intruder, smelling of hot asphalt and the yeasty fermentation of the
    bakery downstairs. Imani sat in her makeshift studio, the foam-padded walls trapping
    the air, sweat trickling down her spine like a slow-moving insect. She didn''t
    need the lights on. The darkness was cool, familiar, and infinite.


    "Episode fifty: The Echo in the Alley," she said, her voice dropping into her
    ''broadcast register''—smooth, resonant, stripped of the fatigue she felt.


    **Opening Image**

    She hit the spacebar. Her screen reader, set to a blistering speed that sounded
    like a robotic hummingbird to anyone else, chirped the timestamp. She was scrubbing
    through raw audio sent by a fan who claimed to have recorded a mugging near the
    Myrtle Avenue stop.


    **Catalyst**

    Imani isolated the background track, filtering out the low-end rumble of the J
    train. There was the scuffle—generic, messy friction against denim—but beneath
    it, something sharper. A rhythmic *click-drag, click-drag*.


    "Detective, you''re listening to the surface," Imani said, turning her chair toward
    the heavy, cologne-saturated presence of Detective Miller standing in her doorway.
    "You hear a struggle. I hear a signature."


    Miller shifted, the leather of his holster creaking. "Ms. Torres, with all due
    respect, the precinct has audio techs. They said it’s wind distortion. You’re
    hearing what you want to hear because you can’t see the video evidence showing...
    well, nothing. It’s a shadow."


    **Fun and Games**

    Imani smiled, a sharp, dangerous expression. "Your techs look at waveforms. I
    live inside them. Sit."


    She didn''t wait for him to comply. Her fingers flew across the braille display
    and the shortcut keys of her editing board. "Layer one: traffic. Gone." She tapped
    a key. The roar vanished. "Layer two: the victim''s breathing. Gone."


    The room filled with the isolated sound: *Click-drag. Click-drag.*


    "That’s not wind," Imani narrated, enjoying the sudden silence from the detective.
    "That is the distinct, uneven scraping of a size twelve boot with a metal heel
    tap, specifically on the left side. And that clicking? That’s a loose ball bearing
    in a fidget spinner. The cheap kind they sell at the bodega on Franklin."


    She spun the volume knob. "Listen closer, Detective. Between the clicks. Heavy
    exhalation through a deviated septum. A whistle on the intake. Your perp isn''t
    a ghost. He’s a mouth-breather with a limp and a nervous habit."
