  evidence: 'VERSION 0 established strong sensory foundation but lacked specificity
    and emotional depth. VERSION 1-2 (truncated in prompt) presumably refined the
    grandmother scene and Ms. Ortega''s role. FINAL OUTPUT demonstrates exceptional
    execution: (1) INTERNAL CONFLICT SHOWN NOT TOLD: Mateo''s paralysis emerges through
    physical details (chafed wrists, pebble in throat, practiced quiet), the ledger
    in his head, and his inability to finish sentences—''Tengo miedo de que...'' left
    hanging. The fear is embodied, not narrated. (2) CRYSTALLIZING GRANDMOTHER MOMENT:
    The lotería scene is the fulcrum. Abuela''s ''se hace camino al andar'' and ''las
    anclas no caminan'' directly address his fear while granting permission. Her rosary
    becomes a physical token of this understanding. The moment is earned through accumulated
    detail (her changing knuckles, silver braid, the way she doesn''t ask him to stay).
    (3) ADULT UNDERSTANDING: Ms. Ortega genuinely grasps the dilemma (''Stretching
    hurts, but it keeps you from getting small'') and reframes the deadline as agency,
    not obligation. Mr. Alvarez later reinforces this by normalizing interdependence
    (''No eres el único que sabe''). Both understand the specific weight of his position.
    (4) CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY: Details feel lived-in, not decorative—the swamp cooler,
    panadería, corrido on the radio, lotería, the clinic app, Border Patrol trucks,
    Abogada García billboard. Spanish dialogue integrates naturally. The grandmother''s
    voice carries specific wisdom rooted in her own crossing. No performative gestures.
    (5) EARNED RESOLUTION: Mateo doesn''t simply decide; he creates systems (prescription
    refills, calendar, trained staff, written scripts). The final image—''hands on
    the wheel not to keep from crashing, but to hold the road''—shows growth through
    action, not epiphany. The ache in his chest and the ''stretched muscle learning
    a new shape'' metaphor demonstrate integration of fear and growth, not their erasure.
    Trajectory shows progressive deepening: V0→V1 added urgency and specificity; V1→Final
    added the grandmother''s agency and wisdom, Mr. Alvarez''s reciprocal support,
    and the practical ledger that proves Mateo''s maturation. All constraints satisfied
    with exceptional calibration.'
