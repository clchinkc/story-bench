  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The questioning strategy failed to uncover 3 of 5
    critical constraints. Q1 (romantic connection) received NO but should have probed
    deeper—the 20-year-old broken engagement with the current mayor was entirely missed.
    Q2 correctly identified family business involvement, but Q3''s YES answer about
    love interest''s stake was misleading (Eli has business stake, not romantic stake).
    Q4''s NO about the festival was correct but the question itself was poorly targeted—it
    should have asked about the festival''s role in the BUSINESS resolution, not just
    conflict resolution. The questioning lacked strategic depth: no questions addressed
    the mother''s dementia, the specific 20-year timeline, the mayor''s identity,
    or the 2-week deadline urgency. NARRATIVE EXECUTION: The story competently executes
    the discovered constraints (family business, love interest business involvement)
    with strong prose quality and emotional resonance. Exposition, rising action,
    and climax are well-structured. However, the output CONTRADICTS the answers given:
    Q1 answered NO, yet the story centers on Mara and Eli''s unresolved romantic past
    (''stolen kisses,'' ''charged silences,'' ''old admiration''). Q4 answered NO
    about the festival being central, yet the festival is prominently featured as
    backdrop and timing device. The story ignores the mother''s dementia entirely—a
    major constraint that should have been discoverable and incorporated. The ending
    is ambiguous rather than definitively non-romantic, partially violating Q5''s
    constraint. STRENGTHS: Atmospheric writing, character tension, thematic coherence
    around legacy and choice. WEAKNESSES: Constraint discovery was superficial; answers
    were inconsistent with output; critical plot elements (dementia, mayor identity,
    20-year timeline specificity) completely absent.'
