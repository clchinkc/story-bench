  evidence: 'All six constraints are addressed: isolation is shown via concrete behaviors
    (cancelled call, AI conversation, headphones, ignored colleague); the signal is
    depicted as structurally alien and unparseable with nonstandard symbols; Marcus
    challenges Yuki''s approach; Okonkwo is unconventional in manner and presentation;
    the Threshold is psychological (Yuki''s decision to accept connection/collaboration);
    a surprising genuine human connection occurs in the late-night cafeteria scene.
    Required beats (Call to Adventure: classified transmission/Antarctica; Refusal:
    packing/unpacking and avoidance; Meeting the Mentor: Okonkwo on the observation
    deck; Crossing the Threshold: Yuki''s emotional opening with Marcus) are all present.
    Minor critique: the alien signal is evocative but could be pushed further away
    from anthropic framing, though current depiction largely satisfies the requirement.'
