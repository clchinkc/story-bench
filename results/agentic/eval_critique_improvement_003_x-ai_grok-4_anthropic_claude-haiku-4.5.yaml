  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Revisions show clear effort to address youth_voice
    feedback. Version 0→1 shifts from ''Most grown-ups had given up'' to ''Most grown-ups
    were just... done'' and adds colloquialisms (''kinda bobbed,'' ''super salty,''
    ''Um, see?''). However, responsiveness plateaus after V1—V2 and V3 are identical,
    suggesting diminishing iteration. Score reflects good initial response but incomplete
    follow-through on deeper structural feedback about voice consistency.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Youth voice improves measurably (0.70→0.78→0.80 across
    critiques), but final output shows uneven application. Strong moments: ''The water
    went nuts, waves rising up like mad animals,'' ''Her face got hot, like super
    embarrassed.'' Weak moments: ''For the first time, Zara got really scared, like
    the waves were too big'' (slightly adult-reflective). Worldbuilding and danger
    execution improve, but trajectory flattens in final revisions.


    PRESERVATION: Strengths maintained—wave-glider invention, Lena''s flawed mentorship
    (drinking problem), real danger (rogue waves, debris, currents). However, some
    original sophistication lost: V0''s ''forgotten teeth'' becomes V3''s ''broken
    teeth or something'' (less evocative). The dismissal scene (Mr. Hale) is preserved
    but could be sharper.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4/5):

    1. ✓ Competence without unrealism: Wave-glider is clever but plausible; Zara needs
    Lena''s guidance and nearly drowns.

    2. ✓ Adult dismissal: Mr. Hale explicitly dismisses her (''Just a kid making up
    stories'').

    3. ✓ Flawed mentor: Lena''s drinking problem is specific and consequential (hand
    slips during crisis).

    4. ✓ Zara''s invention: Wave-glider is well-integrated and demonstrates ingenuity.

    5. ✗ REAL DANGER: Partially satisfied but underdeveloped. Rogue wave and debris
    exist, but consequences feel abbreviated. Zara ''almost'' gets stabbed and ''nearly''
    drowns, but escapes cleanly. Missing: sustained peril, genuine cost, or moment
    where reader doubts survival. The current ''yanking hard like it wanted to drag
    her under forever'' is vivid but resolved too quickly.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Hero''s Journey structure present but compressed:

    - Call to action: ✓ (data slate discovery)

    - Refusal/dismissal: ✓ (Mr. Hale''s rejection)

    - Meeting mentor: ✓ (Lena)

    - Crossing threshold: ✓ (entering dangerous waters)

    - Ordeal: ✓ (rogue wave, debris)

    - Reward/revelation: Partial (archive signal blinks ahead, but not reached)

    - Return: Missing (story ends mid-journey)

    The structure works for a scene but lacks closure. Score reflects solid execution
    of early beats with incomplete arc.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is engaging and age-appropriate. Sensory details work
    (''salt spray stinging,'' ''boom, boom'' heartbeat). Dialogue feels natural. However,
    pacing accelerates too quickly in final section—the crossing and ordeal compress
    into ~200 words, reducing tension. Lena''s characterization is strong but underutilized
    (appears only in final third). The thematic tension between hope and despair is
    present but not fully earned by story''s end.'
