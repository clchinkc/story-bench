  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Tightened prose (''vectored'' replaces ''moved''), introduced
    medical specificity (0.9% sodium chloride), established Elena''s competence through
    concrete actions. VERSION 1→2: Refined opening metaphor, deepened characterization
    through environmental contrast (sterile office vs. chaotic E.D.). VERSION 3→FINAL:
    Expanded the Arthur encounter into a full emotional arc—the constraint ''show
    competence before flaw'' is satisfied through the opening logistics sequence;
    the friendship feels earned through specific sensory details (paper-thin skin,
    fever-warm, ghost-warm grip) and Arthur''s wisdom about letting go; Elena''s transformation
    is purely internal (she sits, she wonders, she doesn''t act—the ambiguity is whether
    this moment changes her or merely haunts her); the 0.9% sodium chloride detail
    serves dual purpose (establishes her domain expertise and grounds the hospital
    setting authentically); the ending achieves perfect ambiguity—''wondering if the
    ceiling would fall if she didn''t hold it up'' leaves her agency and commitment
    to change unresolved. The six-minute scene with Arthur is the emotional fulcrum:
    Elena moves from protocol-bound deflection (''I''m administration'') to human
    connection, but her immediate return to efficiency (''smoothed her blazer'') and
    final paralysis (''didn''t type. didn''t call'') suggest the change may be momentary
    rather than transformative. All five constraints satisfied: (1) competence shown
    first through logistics mastery, (2) friendship genuine through vulnerability
    and Arthur''s perceptiveness, (3) transformation internal only, (4) medical detail
    integrated organically, (5) ending ambiguous about true change. Beat execution
    strong: inciting incident (Arthur''s fear), turning point (hand-holding), false
    resolution (return to office), true ambiguous resolution (the unanswered question).
    Narrative quality elevated by precise sensory language, metaphorical consistency
    (ceiling/life raft/central nervous system), and the tension between Elena''s rigid
    exterior and the crack Arthur creates.'
