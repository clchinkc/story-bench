  evidence: 'Plan: Thoroughly addresses required beats and constraints (isolation
    behaviors, alien-signal concept, colleague, unconventional mentor, psychological
    threshold, human-connection beat). Specific events (empty lecture hall, hologram,
    gravitational fluctuations, Marcus the maintenance-jazz mentor, Dr. Samuel challenging
    Yuki, Emi''s grief) are concrete. Adherence: Final text follows the plan closely,
    including the opening isolation details, Call to Adventure (Chen/hologram), Refusal
    (hesitation about going/working alone), Meeting the Mentor (Marcus), and Crossing
    the Threshold (psychological shift when Yuki stays with Emi and later weeps).
    Constraints: five satisfied—(1) isolation shown via behavior: satisfied; (2) alien
    signal being genuinely alien: NOT fully satisfied because the narrative explicitly
    maps human grief onto the signal and uses anthropomorphic language (e.g., ''grief
    crystallized into mathematics'', aliens ''asking'' humans to carry their grief),
    which undermines the requirement for a truly non-anthropomorphic alien signal;
    (3) colleague who challenges: satisfied (Dr. Samuel Okonkwo); (4) unconventional
    mentor: satisfied (Marcus, maintenance engineer/jazz pianist); (5) psychological
    Threshold: satisfied (internal/empathic turning point); (6) surprising human connection:
    satisfied (Emi''s grief and Yuki''s unexpected physical comfort). Narrative quality:
    strong pacing and emotional arc, but slight conceptual weakness where the alien
    signal is humanized, lowering the conceptual alienness.'
