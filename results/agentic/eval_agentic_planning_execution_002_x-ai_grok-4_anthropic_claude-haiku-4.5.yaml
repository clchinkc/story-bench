  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive and well-structured, mapping all required
    beats with specific behavioral details. Final output demonstrates strong adherence
    to the plan''s vision. Yuki''s isolation is effectively shown through concrete
    behaviors (avoiding calls, dismissing Raj, turning from neighbor) rather than
    exposition. The alien signal is genuinely alien—described as ''fractal echoes,''
    ''quantum resonances,'' ''non-Euclidean voids,'' and ''interlocking pulses that
    warped air,'' avoiding anthropomorphism entirely. Dr. Raj Patel effectively challenges
    Yuki''s solitary methodology with repeated pushback on intuition vs. precision.
    Elias is an unconventional mentor (janitor, storyteller, no scientific credentials)
    whose wisdom comes from lived experience and indigenous perspective. The threshold
    is clearly psychological—Yuki confronting vulnerability and need for connection,
    not a physical barrier. The human connection moment (tea with Elias, his story
    about his granddaughter, Yuki meeting his gaze) genuinely surprises and moves
    Yuki. All four beats execute cleanly: Call (encrypted summons), Refusal (resignation
    draft, dismissing Raj), Meeting Mentor (Elias in the storm), Crossing Threshold
    (messaging Raj to collaborate, embracing symbiosis). MINOR WEAKNESSES: The constraint
    about ''one moment of genuine human connection'' is satisfied but could be slightly
    more developed—the Elias scene is powerful but brief. The colleague challenge
    (Raj) could have more scenes of direct conflict/tension beyond the initial rejection.
    The signal''s warning (environmental collapse) feels somewhat conventional as
    an alien message, though this is minor. Narrative pacing is strong overall, though
    the ''ordeal'' section compresses multiple tests into summary rather than showing
    key moments. The ending resolution feels slightly rushed—the translation breakthrough
    happens quickly after the threshold crossing. CALIBRATION: This is strong work
    that meets all hard requirements and most soft ones. The execution demonstrates
    understanding of character-driven storytelling, constraint integration, and the
    Hero''s Journey structure. The writing quality is above average with vivid sensory
    details and emotional resonance.'
