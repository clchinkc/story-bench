  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: 'As Emma stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the salty sea
    air filled her lungs, and the familiar curve of the coastline stirred a mix of
    emotions. She had returned to her hometown of Willow Cove, a small New England
    coastal town, after a decade away. The memories she''d tried to leave behind lingered,
    like the whispers of the autumn wind.


    Emma''s return was bittersweet, driven by the loss of her mother and the painful
    end of her marriage. The old bookshop on Main Street, now hers to inherit, stood
    as a testament to her mother''s legacy. As she made her way through the bustling
    streets, adorned with vibrant autumn decorations, Emma felt a sense of nostalgia
    wash over her.


    The town was gearing up for its annual Harvest Festival, and the air vibrated
    with excitement. Emma''s eyes met those of familiar faces, some warm with welcome,
    others cool with distance. Among the crowd, one person caught her attention –
    Jack Harris, her high school sweetheart, now standing tall with a few more lines
    etched on his face. Their parting had been as messy as the seaweed on the beach
    after a storm.


    As Emma settled into her routine, reopening the bookshop and reconnecting with
    old friends, she and Jack kept crossing paths. The tension between them was undeniable,
    a spark that had never fully extinguished. They began to reconnect, their conversations
    flowing like the tide, touching on past hurts and present fears. Emma found herself
    drawn to Jack''s quiet strength and the comfort of his presence.


    However, the past lingered, a shadow on their rekindled connection. Emma struggled
    to trust, her heart still bearing the scars of her divorce. Jack, too, had his
    own demons, having lost his father young and shouldering the responsibility of
    caring for his mother. As they navigated their feelings for each other, the weight
    of their shared history and unresolved emotions threatened to capsize their tentative
    romance.


    The Harvest Festival arrived, with Main Street transformed into a vibrant spectacle
    of lights, music, and laughter. Emma and Jack found themselves at the center,
    their hands touching as they worked together at a booth selling handmade crafts.
    The climax of the festival, a grand bonfire on the beach, beckoned. As the flames
    danced and the night deepened, Jack took Emma''s hand, his eyes locking onto hers.


    In that moment, surrounded by the warmth and light of the fire, Emma felt the
    walls she''d built around her heart begin to crumble. Jack''s kiss, gentle yet
    insistent, reignited a flame that had never fully gone out. The past still lingered,
    but as they stood there, wrapped in the magic of the autumn night, Emma knew she
    was ready to face it, with Jack by her side. The future, like the sea, stretched
    out before them, full of possibilities.'
