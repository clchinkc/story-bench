  evidence: 'The final output demonstrates exceptional execution across all constraints.
    Internal conflict is shown through Mateo''s physical hesitation at the bus stop,
    his unanswered texts, and the stone-in-chest sensation—never explicitly labeled
    as conflict. The grandmother scene crystallizes the choice perfectly: her confession
    about leaving at sixteen, her fifty-year regret, and her explicit permission (''Take
    the ticket, Mateo. Not because you have to go. Because you have to choose'') create
    the emotional fulcrum. The grandmother genuinely understands Mateo''s dilemma
    through lived experience, not platitude—she''s lived his exact tension between
    duty and self. Cultural elements feel deeply authentic: the bilingual forms, the
    telenovela in background, the pan dulce, café de olla, the specific detail of
    insurance companies sending English-only documents. These aren''t decorative but
    structural to Mateo''s reality. Resolution is earned through genuine growth: Mateo
    doesn''t reject responsibility or embrace rebellion; he reframes both as compatible.
    The final insight (''responsibility and self weren''t opposites'') emerges from
    his choice, not from external wisdom. The three incomplete versions show clear
    progression toward this depth, with each revision adding emotional specificity
    and removing exposition. The final beat—helping with bills, correcting pronunciation—demonstrates
    integration rather than resolution, showing Mateo has internalized the lesson.
    The ''door you chose not to open'' metaphor reframes sacrifice as agency, which
    is the earned wisdom. Quality improvement is visible in emotional precision, cultural
    authenticity, and the sophistication of the thematic resolution.'
