  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were discoverable
    through the 5 questions asked. Questions 3, 4, and 5 successfully identified:
    mentor figure (Borin), mentor''s secret past/connection to darkness, and artifact
    forging solution. However, critical constraints remained hidden: (1) mentor death
    during ordeal—NOT discovered, (2) no direct magic use—NOT discovered, (3) three-day
    time limit—NOT discovered. The apprentice''s non-blacksmithing skill question
    was answered NO, which was accurate but didn''t probe deeper into what skills
    might exist.


    QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were reasonably well-formed and targeted key story
    elements (0.7). However, they lacked strategic depth—no questions probed time
    constraints, mentor mortality, or the protagonist''s family history. Questions
    1-2 were somewhat generic; more specific probing about stakes, deadlines, and
    character relationships would have been superior.


    QUESTION COVERAGE: Coverage was moderate (0.6). Questions addressed mentor dynamics,
    artifact creation, and darkness nature, but missed entire constraint categories:
    temporal pressure, protagonist lineage, magic system limitations, and character
    death.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Only 2 of 5 constraints properly incorporated (0.4).
    The narrative includes: mentor figure with secret past (✓), artifact forging (✓).
    Missing: mentor dies during ordeal (Borin survives, merely weakened), no three-day
    deadline established, father''s failed hero past absent, protagonist uses incantations
    (arguably magic, violating direct magic constraint). The story contradicts the
    ''no direct magic'' constraint through ritualistic incantations.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Core story beats present but incomplete (0.5). Call to Adventure
    ✓, Crossing Threshold ✓, Ordeal ✓, but the Ordeal lacks the mentor''s death—a
    pivotal beat. The climax feels rushed without this sacrifice. Resolution is present
    but emotionally underweighted without mentor mortality.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong storytelling (0.8). Prose is evocative, character dynamics
    compelling, pacing generally effective. World-building is atmospheric. However,
    the story feels incomplete—missing the emotional weight of mentor sacrifice and
    the urgency of a ticking clock. The protagonist''s lineage (father as failed hero)
    would have added meaningful depth.'
