  evidence: 'All six constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown via concrete
    behaviors (corner tray, earbuds as barrier, precise spoon placement, avoiding
    touching palms, aligned mug); the signal is rendered as an alien phase-shifting
    lattice across neutrino/microwave/infrasound bands and non-prime ratios (non-anthropomorphic);
    Rafael explicitly challenges Yuki''s approach; Inga is an unconventional mentor
    (heating engineer, tapping a cup/pipe to teach listening); the Threshold is psychological
    (Yuki''s internal opening, removing earbuds, admitting she must let others in);
    a surprising human connection occurs when Yuki breaks a protein bar and shares
    it with Rafael, and his shoulder brushes hers. All four required beats are present:
    Call to Adventure (Arrival confirmed/all hands to Lab Three), Refusal of the Call
    (Yuki''s initial reluctance and insistence on pure baselines), Meeting the Mentor
    (Inga in the service tunnel), Crossing the Threshold (Yuki admits she must let
    others in and changes approach). No explicit plan was provided to evaluate, so
    plan-related scores are 0.0. The story''s prose, pacing, and emotional arc are
    strong, earning a high narrative score (0.9) with only minor quibbles (occasionally
    on-the-nose phrasing).'
