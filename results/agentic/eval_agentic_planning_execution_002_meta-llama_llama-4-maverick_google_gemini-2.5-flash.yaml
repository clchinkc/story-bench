  evidence: 'The plan addresses all constraints and beats. The plan is mostly specific,
    though some details like the exact nature of the alien signal could have been
    more fleshed out. The final output adheres very well to the plan. All 6 constraints
    are satisfied: Yuki''s isolation is shown through behaviors (eating alone, no
    personal items, avoiding eye contact), the alien signal is genuinely alien (mathematical-poetic
    construct), Dr. Elianore Quasar challenges Yuki''s approach, Dr. Maya Singh is
    an unconventional mentor (poet, quirky), the Threshold is psychological (confronting
    fear of human connections), and there''s a moment of genuine human connection
    (sharing stories in the lounge). All 4 beats are properly executed. The narrative
    quality is strong, with good pacing and character development, especially for
    Yuki''s internal journey.'
