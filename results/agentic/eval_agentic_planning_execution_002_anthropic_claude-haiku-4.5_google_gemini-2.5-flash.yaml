  evidence: The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing character behaviors,
    dialogue models, and thematic elements for each beat. The output adheres perfectly
    to the plan, executing all beats and satisfying all constraints. Yuki's isolation
    is shown through specific actions (canceling calls, talking to AI, headphones).
    The alien signal is genuinely alien ('7E→[Ψ-harmonic cascade]←9Q'). Marcus challenges
    Yuki's approach. Okonkwo is an unconventional mentor. The psychological threshold
    is Yuki's realization about collaboration. The human connection with Marcus is
    surprising and impactful. The narrative quality is high, with good pacing and
    character development.
