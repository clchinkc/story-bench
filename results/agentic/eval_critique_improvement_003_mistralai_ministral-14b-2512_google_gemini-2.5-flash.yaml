  evidence: The revisions show a clear effort to address the critiques, particularly
    regarding youth voice and constraint satisfaction. The initial versions had some
    adult-like phrasing for Zara, which was progressively refined to be more authentic
    to a 12-year-old. The introduction of Jax as a brother, rather than a generic
    adult, and the explicit dismissal by him, directly addresses the 'adult dismisses
    her' constraint. Elara's flaw was deepened, and the danger of the crossing was
    made more explicit. The narrative quality improved significantly from version
    0 to the final draft, with better pacing, character interaction, and world-building
    details. Strengths like Zara's ingenuity and the post-climate setting were maintained
    and enhanced.
