  evidence: 'Across the revision rounds the piece kept its strongest elements (youthful
    sensory detail, vivid post-climate imagery) while tightening voice cues that critics
    flagged—lines like ''She wanted to throw something... Instead, she made herself
    breathe, the way Mama taught her'' recur and were emphasized, which addresses
    the youth_voice concern called out in the critiques. The final version also makes
    the inventions explicit (solar charger; hand-built rebreather) and clarifies the
    mentor''s specific flaw (Reyes'' diving-related freezing and loss of hope). Improvements
    are noticeable but incremental rather than radical: the revisions preserved worldbuilding
    and core beats while sharpening Zara''s reactions and the stakes. Hero''s Journey
    beats are present and coherent in this excerpt (call to adventure: finding the
    tablet; refusal/dismissal: Reyes'' initial rejection; crossing/commitment: Zara
    insisting he take her and boarding the skiff), though later beats (ordeal, reward,
    return) are not included in the provided excerpt, so execution is solid for the
    portion shown but not demonstrably complete for the entire arc.'
