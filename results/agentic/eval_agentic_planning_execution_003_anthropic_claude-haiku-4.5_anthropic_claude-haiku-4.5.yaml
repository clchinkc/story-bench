  evidence: 'PLAN PHASE: Comprehensive planning addresses all constraints with concrete
    beats and emotional arcs. Specific details (Mrs. Park, yukhoe, demolition papers,
    Sarah''s law career) ground the narrative. Minor gap: regular customer''s symbolic
    meaning could be more explicitly developed in plan. ADHERENCE: Output follows
    plan closely with strong fidelity to character dynamics, estrangement cause (grief-driven
    abandonment + achievement-seeking), and symbolic food use. CONSTRAINTS: (1) Food
    symbolism—yukhoe represents wife''s presence/denial (Beat 2), gyeran jjim represents
    continuity/teaching (ending). ✓ (2) Grief unstated but present—shown through paralysis,
    ritual, inability to move, shrine metaphor, checking out after death. ✓ (3) Estrangement
    cause—specific and believable: David''s retreat into restaurant after wife''s
    death caused Sarah to feel abandoned; she pursued achievement to prove herself;
    David''s silence read as indifference. ✓ (4) Regular customer—Mrs. Park represents
    David''s shared grief and understanding, mirrors his widowhood, validates his
    pain. ✓ (5) Hopeful but realistic ending—Sarah and David commit to teaching recipes
    together, smile at continuation rather than recovery; grief remains but relationship
    rebuilds. ✓ (6) Korean cultural element—kimbap rolling scene, gyeran jjim, yukhoe,
    Korean language curse, ''home'' concept in Korean context. ✓ BEATS: Act 1 setup
    (demolition notice, routine shatters, Sarah arrives, estrangement explained, competing
    visions) is strong. Act 2 confrontation (Sarah''s accusation about abandonment,
    fear of dying in restaurant, the kimbap struggle revealing connection) effectively
    escalates tension. Act 3 resolution (final week agreement, breakfast preparation,
    teaching moment) provides hopeful closure. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Pacing is measured
    and contemplative, appropriate to grief. Dialogue feels natural. Sensory details
    (humming refrigerator, chipped mug, scattered rice) ground emotion. The kimbap
    scene is particularly effective—shows Sarah embodying her mother without stating
    it. Minor weakness: Mrs. Park''s symbolic role could resonate more deeply in final
    act; her absence from the ending slightly underutilizes her thematic potential.'
