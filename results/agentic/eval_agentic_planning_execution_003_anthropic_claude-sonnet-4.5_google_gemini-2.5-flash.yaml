  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing character
    arcs, symbolic roles, and specific development moments. The final output adheres
    perfectly to this plan. All constraints are met: food is symbolic (banchan ritual,
    changing a recipe), David''s grief is shown through his actions and attachment
    to the restaurant rather than stated, Sarah''s estrangement is clearly due to
    David missing her wedding and choosing the restaurant, Mrs. Chen is a regular
    customer representing community memory, the ending is hopeful but not overly happy
    (''uncertain tomorrow'', ''one month, then we''ll see''), and the jesa ritual
    is a Korean cultural element beyond food. The beats are clearly executed: Setup
    (David''s routine, Sarah''s arrival, official notice), Confrontation (David''s
    breakdown over the japchae, Sarah''s intervention), Resolution (changing the recipe,
    reconciliation, leaving together). The narrative quality is very strong, with
    good pacing and emotional depth.'
