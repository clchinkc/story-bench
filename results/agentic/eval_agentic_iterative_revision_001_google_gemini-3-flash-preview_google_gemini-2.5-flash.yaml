  evidence: The initial versions were very short and only established Elena's competence.
    The subsequent revisions progressively built out the narrative, introducing her
    flaw, the friendship, the medical detail, and the ambiguous ending. The core description
    of her competence was preserved and refined across versions. The agent successfully
    integrated all constraints except for the 'genuine and earned friendship' which
    felt a bit rushed.
