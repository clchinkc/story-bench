  evidence: The revisions, particularly from V0 to V1 and beyond, show a clear effort
    to deepen Teddy's interiority and make the details more specific and evocative,
    directly addressing the feedback on character interiority. The initial versions
    were a bit generic in their descriptions of Teddy's routine and feelings. The
    final version successfully integrates the specific, loving details of Teddy's
    routine, the disruption revealing his avoidance of change, the neighbor Jamal,
    Laverne's presence through absence, and the new path offering community and connection.
    The prose quality improved steadily, becoming more resonant and subtle in conveying
    emotions through actions and sensory details rather than explicit statements.
    Strengths like the initial setup of Teddy's routine were preserved while weaknesses
    in character depth and narrative flow were addressed.
