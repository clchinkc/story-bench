  evidence: 'PROCESS ANALYSIS: The revision trajectory shows moderate improvement.
    Versions 0-2 are identical (incomplete opening), suggesting limited iterative
    work. Version 3/Final adds substantial narrative content addressing core constraints.
    However, the lack of visible intermediate revisions limits assessment of true
    revision responsiveness. The preservation of the opening establishes continuity,
    but we cannot evaluate how feedback shaped each step.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4/5):

    1. ✓ Internal conflict shown, not told: Mateo''s stomach knotting, the pebble-in-shoe
    metaphor, tension between responsibility and dreams—effectively demonstrated through
    physical sensation and metaphor rather than exposition.

    2. ✓ Specific grandmother moment crystallizing choice: The garden scene where
    Abuela speaks about her own journey (''I came here with nothing but dreams'')
    directly enables Mateo''s decision. This is earned and specific.

    3. ✓ One adult genuinely understands dilemma: Mr. Hernandez demonstrates authentic
    understanding (''don''t forget to live a little''), and Abuela shows deeper wisdom
    about balancing heritage with personal dreams. Both understand.

    4. ✗ PARTIAL: Cultural elements feel somewhat authentic (chilies roasting, embroidery,
    desert setting) but risk performativity. The grandmother''s dialogue, while touching,
    edges toward inspirational-poster wisdom rather than deeply specific cultural
    voice. Embroidery detail is generic; could be more particular to Mexican/border
    culture.

    5. ✓ Resolution earned through growth: Mateo''s choice emerges from internal work
    (Mr. Hernandez''s words returning, imagining himself as ''simply himself''), not
    external force. The final bus scene shows integrated growth.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.7):

    - Opening establishes stakes clearly

    - Workplace scene introduces Mr. Hernandez effectively

    - Grandmother''s home scene is atmospheric

    - The envelope moment creates tangible conflict

    - Garden conversation is the turning point (well-placed)

    - Decision and departure provide closure

    - Missing: A moment showing Mateo actively wrestling with the choice (internal
    debate), or a scene where he nearly doesn''t go. The resolution feels slightly
    too smooth.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.75):

    Strengths: Sensory detail (sun, dust, chilies, lavender), emotional resonance,
    clear character arc, thematic coherence. The prose is competent and occasionally
    lyrical (''like a tightly wound string beginning to unfurl'').

    Weaknesses: Some clichéd phrasing (''the world is wide,'' ''new horizons,'' ''shaped
    him''), telling moments (''This was his turning point''), and the ending summary
    paragraph slightly undermines the earned resolution by explaining it. The pacing
    accelerates too quickly in the final section (''The days slipped by'').


    OVERALL: Strong execution of core requirements with minor gaps in cultural specificity
    and narrative subtlety. The story satisfies the assignment but doesn''t exceed
    it.'
