  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: The plan is comprehensive, thematic, and well-structured with
    clear constraint mapping. The final output demonstrates strong adherence to the
    plan with vivid sensory details and emotional authenticity. All three narrative
    beats are clearly executed: Setup (David alone, demolition notice, Mina''s arrival),
    Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint with city planner revelation and Mina''s ultimatum
    about choosing), and Resolution (final dinner, demolition, California kitchen).
    Food symbolism is effectively deployed twice (juk as comfort/memory, kimchi as
    stagnation/preservation). Grief is powerfully present but unspoken—conveyed through
    the untouched apron, avoidance of the apartment, trembling hands, and the final
    emotional breakthrough. Daughter''s estrangement has a specific, believable cause:
    David''s post-wife grief led him to neglect Mina (canceling plans, prioritizing
    restaurant) when she was 18, creating years of abandonment. Mr. Kim serves as
    the regular customer representing continuity and community. The ending is hopeful
    but earned and realistic—reconciliation is tentative, David moves forward but
    carries grief, and the final scene shows growth without false resolution. MINOR
    GAPS: Korean cultural elements beyond food are somewhat limited. ''Arirang'' is
    mentioned in the plan but not in the final output. Seollal is referenced once.
    The constraint asks for ''at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food''—while
    Arirang and Seollal appear in the plan, the output relies heavily on food as the
    primary cultural marker. The output could have integrated more Korean cultural
    specificity (e.g., explicit mention of Arirang humming, more detailed Seollal
    references, or other cultural practices). This is a partial satisfaction rather
    than full. PACING: The narrative moves efficiently with good tension escalation.
    The dialogue feels natural. The sensory details ground the story effectively.
    The time jumps (48 hours, then six months) work well. EMOTIONAL AUTHENTICITY:
    The grief portrayal is nuanced and earned. The reconciliation doesn''t feel manipulative.
    The final image of David teaching Mina, with her burning the juk and him laughing,
    provides genuine hope without sentimentality.'
