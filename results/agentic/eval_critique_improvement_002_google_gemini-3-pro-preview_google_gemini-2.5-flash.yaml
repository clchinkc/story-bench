  evidence: The revisions consistently built upon the previous versions, adding detail
    and refining character interactions. The initial versions were quite sparse, but
    each subsequent version added more depth to Marcus's internal state and the writers'
    room environment. The final output successfully integrated all constraints, particularly
    the 'laugh before sadness' and 'theme by minor character' points, which were explicitly
    called out in critiques. The 'almost breaks but covers with a joke' moment was
    also well-executed and clearly visible in the final version. The new writer's
    perception of Marcus was also effectively developed, showing her insight without
    making her naive.
