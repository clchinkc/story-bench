output: 'The salt air of Oakhaven usually smelled of brine and drying kelp, but in
  October, the wind carried the scent of woodsmoke and rotting leaves. Elias Thorne,
  forty years old and wearing a coat that felt too thin for New England, stood in
  the center of *Thorne & Sons Books*.


  The shop was exactly as his father had left it: dusty, labyrinthine, and drowning
  in debt.


  Elias ran a hand over a stack of unpaid invoices on the counter. He wasn’t here
  to liquidate the assets and run back to Chicago; he was here to save the legacy.
  The bank had given him until the end of the month to come up with a miracle, or
  the foreclosure would be finalized. That miracle was the Oakhaven Autumn Festival’s
  "Grand Prize"—a twenty-thousand-dollar grant awarded to the business that hosted
  the best event of the season.


  He grabbed his scarf and headed for the Town Hall. He had a permit to file for his
  "Midnight Poetry Gala."


  When he pushed through the heavy oak doors of the council room, the Mayor smiled
  nervously. Standing next to the Mayor, arms crossed over a cashmere sweater, was
  Silas Vance.


  Silas. The boy Elias had left behind twenty years ago without so much as a goodbye
  note. The man who now owned the high-end antique shop across the street. Silas looked
  good—sharp, successful, and currently looking at Elias with the warmth of a glacier.


  "Elias," Silas said, his voice flat.


  "Silas."


  "I was just explaining," the Mayor interjected, sweating, "that due to the storm
  damage at the pier, we have limited venue space. The council decided that the Bookshop
  and the Antique Store must combine their entries. You’ll be co-hosting the Midnight
  Gala."


  "Absolutely not," Silas snapped. "I don''t work with deserters."


  "And I don''t work with antique dealers who price gouge tourists," Elias shot back,
  the old defensive reflex kicking in instantly.


  "It’s mandatory," the Mayor said, slamming his gavel. "Collaborate, or neither of
  you is eligible for the grant."


  The next two weeks were a war of attrition waged in pumpkin spice and fairy lights.


  Elias wanted rustic charm; Silas wanted Victorian elegance. Elias wanted local cider;
  Silas insisted on imported wine. They spent late nights in the bookshop, moving
  shelves and arguing over tablecloths, the air thick with twenty years of unsaid
  words.


  "You''re putting the garland too low," Silas criticized three days before the festival,
  standing on a ladder.


  "I''m putting it where people won''t strangle themselves," Elias muttered, steadying
  the ladder. "Some of us care about liability."


  "Some of us care about aesthetics. But I suppose you wouldn''t know about sticking
  with something until it looks good. You prefer to just walk out the door."


  Elias gripped the ladder harder. "I came back, didn''t I?"


  "To save a building," Silas said, looking down, his eyes flashing. "Not for the
  people."


  "The building is all I have left of my dad," Elias confessed, the admission torn
  out of him by exhaustion. "If we don''t win this grant, Silas, I lose it. I lose
  everything. I’m bankrupt."


  Silas went quiet. He climbed down the ladder, the hostility in his posture softening
  into something more complex—pity, perhaps, or shared grief. "You should have told
  me."


  "Why? So you could gloat?"


  "So I could help," Silas said softly.


  The night of the Gala arrived with a vengeance—specifically, a coastal squall that
  knocked out the power grid ten minutes before the doors opened.


  Inside the shop, total darkness fell. The wind howled against the glass. The guests
  were outside, waiting.


  "It''s over," Elias said, sinking against the counter. "No lights, no music. We''re
  done."


  "No," Silas’s voice cut through the dark. "We aren''t."


  A match flared. Silas was lighting the decorative hurricane lanterns they had argued
  about for three days. The glow illuminated his face, determined and fierce. "Grab
  the candles from the antique displays. All of them. We don''t need electricity.
  We have atmosphere."


  They moved together in a synchronized frenzy, a dance they hadn''t shared in two
  decades. Elias cleared the floor while Silas arranged the lighting. As they placed
  the final candle in the window, the shop transformed. It wasn''t just a store anymore;
  it was a cathedral of shadows and gold, intimate and magical.


  Elias turned to Silas. The anger was gone, burned away by the adrenaline. They were
  inches apart, breathing hard in the flickering light.


  "We did it," Elias whispered.


  "We make a good team," Silas admitted, his gaze dropping to Elias’s lips. "When
  we aren''t trying to destroy each other."


  "I''m sorry I left," Elias said, the truth finally landing.


  "I''m sorry I didn''t ask you to stay," Silas replied.


  Elias reached out, his hand brushing Silas’s. The bell above the door chimed as
  the first guests arrived, gasping in delight at the candlelit wonderland, but neither
  man looked at the door. They were already looking at their future.'
