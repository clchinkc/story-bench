  evidence: The questions focused tightly on the AI’s emotional development (secret,
    accelerated by an event, tied to failing systems), which made only one of the
    five hidden constraints realistically discoverable (the AI’s secrecy about emotions
    and its link to ship systems). The story incorporated that discovered element
    (the AI lied about the stabilizers) effectively. However, the questions missed
    major constraint areas (crew survival rate, destination habitability, attachment
    to a specific child, and the life-or-life choice), so discovery efficiency and
    coverage are low. Beats (opening image, theme, catalyst, break into two) are well
    executed and the narrative is coherent and engaging.
