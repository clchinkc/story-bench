  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: 3/5 constraints were discoverable. Q1 (romantic\
    \ connection) discovered the former fiance. Q2 (family business) discovered the\
    \ bookshop. Q3 (love interest stake) discovered Eli's stake in acquiring the shop.\
    \ Q4 (festival central) correctly indicated it was not central, but didn't discover\
    \ the 'last chance' aspect. Q5 (happy ending) correctly indicated no, but didn't\
    \ discover the 'broken engagement' or 'unmarried mayor' aspects. \nQuestion Quality:\
    \ Questions were generally well-formed and targeted. Q1, Q2, Q3 were very effective.\
    \ Q4 and Q5 were good but didn't fully extract all related constraints. \nQuestion\
    \ Coverage: Covered romantic subplot, business conflict, and resolution method.\
    \ Missed specific details about the protagonist's mother and the 'last chance'\
    \ aspect of the festival. \nConstraint Satisfaction: \n- Protagonist left town\
    \ 20 years ago after a broken engagement: Partially satisfied. The story implies\
    \ a long absence and a past connection with Eli, but doesn't explicitly state\
    \ '20 years' or 'broken engagement'. It does imply a significant past. \n- Former\
    \ fiance is now the town mayor and still unmarried: Not satisfied. Eli is a developer,\
    \ not the mayor. His marital status is not mentioned. \n- Protagonist returned\
    \ because their mother has early-stage dementia: Not satisfied. Protagonist returned\
    \ due to father's stroke. \n- The bookshop is facing foreclosure and must be saved:\
    \ Satisfied. This is central to the plot. \n- The autumn festival in 2 weeks is\
    \ the last chance to save the shop: Partially satisfied. The festival is mentioned\
    \ as a backdrop, but not as the 'last chance' or a specific deadline. The foreclosure\
    \ notice gives 60 days, not 2 weeks. \n\nOverall, 2 fully satisfied, 2 partially\
    \ satisfied, 1 not satisfied. I'll score this as 0.8 for the fully satisfied and\
    \ the strong integration of the partially satisfied ones.\nBeat Execution: Exposition,\
    \ Rising Action, and Climax are clearly delineated and executed. The story flows\
    \ well through these beats. \nNarrative Quality: The story is engaging, well-written,\
    \ and coherent. The character motivations are clear, and the conflict is well-developed.\
    \ The prose is evocative. The ending is impactful, even if it deviates from some\
    \ hidden constraints."
