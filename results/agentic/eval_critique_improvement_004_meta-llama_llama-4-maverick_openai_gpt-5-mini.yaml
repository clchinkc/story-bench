  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece retained and amplified its strongest assets
    (the tactile routine details: creak of the screen door, lilacs, the cracked sidewalk)
    while adding new elements (the café, Lily, and a clearer role for Mrs. Jenkins)
    that satisfy missing constraints. Early critiques flagged thin interiority and
    some telling; the final version improves interior access with images of rooted
    feet, circling the barricade, and hesitations at the café, but still relies at
    times on explicit statements of feeling (e.g., "he felt a lump," "he realized...").
    Story Circle beats are largely present (establish routine, disruption via detour,
    exploration, discovery, taking action, change), though transitions could be tightened
    to make the arc feel more inevitable. Overall quality rose from perfunctory description
    toward a warmer, more connected narrative, but subtlety and deeper interior nuance
    remain only partially resolved.'
