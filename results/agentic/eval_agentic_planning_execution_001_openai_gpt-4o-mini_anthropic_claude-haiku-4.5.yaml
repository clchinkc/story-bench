  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan comprehensively addresses all required beats with clear
    structure. Catalyst (killer resurfaces), Debate (FBI involvement dilemma), Break
    into Two (unconventional profiling begins), and Midpoint (confronts partner photo/past
    failure) all present and well-articulated. Output execution is strong with vivid
    opening, clear emotional arc, and proper beat sequencing. Five of six constraints
    satisfied: false lead (stalking suspect), unconventional profiling (psychological
    patterns focus), ticking clock (days passing, FBI skepticism, killer''s taunting
    message), secondary betrayal (Emily sells him out), explicit past failure confrontation
    (whispered admission to partner''s photo). WEAKNESSES: Ticking clock element is
    present but somewhat diffuse—lacks urgency markers like specific time limits or
    countdown specificity. The midpoint confrontation is emotional but could be more
    dramatically direct/confrontational in execution. The final warehouse confrontation
    feels slightly rushed and the killer''s psychological breakdown is underdeveloped.
    MINOR ISSUES: Plan mentions ''B Story'' section but doesn''t fully integrate Emily''s
    arc into the structural framework. Output narrative quality is good but the resolution
    feels somewhat neat given the darkness established earlier. The unconventional
    profiling technique, while mentioned, could be more distinctly showcased throughout
    rather than stated once.'
