  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.72): Revisions show minimal substantive changes
    across versions 0-3. The primary edit removes ''her workbench floating gently''
    (addressing potential adult-voice concern from Critique 1), but this is a single-sentence
    fix. No evidence of addressing other critique points systematically. The youth_voice
    scores (0.78-0.82) were already strong, suggesting critiques may have been affirming
    rather than prescriptive. Missed opportunity to strengthen weaker areas based
    on feedback.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.68): Versions 0→1→2→3 show near-identical text after
    the initial edit. This suggests either: (a) critiques were sufficiently positive
    that major revision felt unnecessary, or (b) the writer didn''t identify actionable
    gaps. The trajectory is flat rather than ascending. However, the final output
    IS stronger than Version 0 due to the workbench removal and the complete narrative
    arc provided (which earlier versions may have lacked).


    PRESERVATION (0.85): Strengths are well-maintained: ''Holy crap'' authenticity,
    voice cracks, impulsive stowaway gambit, Gran''s dismissal, Chen''s flawed mentorship
    (trauma-driven over-caution), real danger (storm season, dark water, currents).
    The core voice and emotional beats survive intact.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.80 / 4 of 5):

    ✓ Youth voice: Authentic. ''Holy crap,'' voice cracks, impulsive decision-making
    without full consequence-mapping, philosophical observations that feel earned
    rather than coached.

    ✓ Adult dismissal: Gran (''Let it rest'') and Chen (''just a kid chasing fairy
    tales'') both dismiss her initially.

    ✓ Flawed mentor: Chen''s flaw is specific and tragic—trauma-induced over-checking
    (checking ''three times'') that stems from her daughter''s death. This creates
    realistic tension.

    ✓ Zara''s invention: Solar panel from calculator cells, rewired into functioning
    panel. Demonstrates ingenuity and becomes her currency.

    ✗ Real danger in crossing: PARTIALLY MET. The Shallows crossing involves real
    environmental hazards (storm season, currents, rusted structures), but the excerpt
    ends at the threshold (''They were really doing this''). The actual crossing/danger
    sequence is not shown. This is a structural incompleteness rather than absence—the
    setup promises real danger but doesn''t execute it within the provided text.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.78): Hero''s Journey beats present:

    - Ordinary World: Zara salvaging, working with limited tech

    - Call to Adventure: Map discovery

    - Refusal: Gran''s dismissal

    - Meeting Mentor: Chen (though reluctant)

    - Crossing Threshold: Stowaway gambit, boat departure

    - Missing/Incomplete: Tests, Ordeal, Reward (text ends before these)

    The provided excerpt covers ~60% of a full Hero''s Journey. Beats that exist are
    well-executed; incompleteness is due to scope, not quality.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.82): Strong sensory detail (''fingers black with grease,''
    ''heart hammered,'' ''knuckles white''), authentic dialogue, effective pacing
    between discovery and action. Chen''s characterization is particularly strong—her
    trauma-driven caution feels earned and creates genuine tension rather than arbitrary
    obstacle. The worldbuilding (flooded city, salvage economy, pre-flood tech as
    valuable) is vivid and consistent. Hope is present (Zara''s belief in fixing things)
    without saccharine tone. The ending creates genuine stakes and forward momentum.


    KEY LIMITATION: The excerpt is a beginning/opening sequence, not a complete story.
    Constraint satisfaction and beat execution scores reflect what''s present, but
    the narrative is incomplete. If this is intended as a full submission, the missing
    climax/resolution significantly impacts overall evaluation.'
