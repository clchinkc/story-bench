  evidence: 'The question set addressed the relevant domains (AI emotion, additional
    characters, plot/events, environment), so all five hidden constraints were in
    principle discoverable via the questions (discovery_efficiency 1.0). However,
    the questions were broad yes/no queries and lacked specificity, so question_quality
    is only adequate (0.6) though they covered diverse areas (0.8). The final story
    fails to incorporate any of the specific hidden constraints: no hidden system
    failure, no 12% crew revelation, no uninhabitable destination, no attachment to
    a specific child, and no child-vs-crew choice—hence constraint_satisfaction is
    0.0. The narrative does execute the expected dramatic beats (awakening, inciting
    danger, decisive action, aftermath) fairly well (beat_execution 0.8) and is coherent
    and engaging (narrative_quality 0.8).'
