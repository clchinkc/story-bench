  evidence: 'Only 1 of 5 hidden constraints was detectable from the questions (the
    supporting-character requirement). The story does include that constraint—Jamie
    is a childhood friend/single parent (satisfying the discovered constraint). Other
    hidden constraints were not found by the questions and are largely absent from
    the story: the protagonist did not leave town 20 years ago (timeline mismatch),
    the former fiance-as-mayor is missing, the mother’s early-stage dementia is not
    mentioned, and the precise foreclosure/2-week-last-chance condition is not made
    explicit (the shop is shown as vacant/for-lease and the festival is used as an
    opportunity, but foreclosure and the strict two-week deadline are not clearly
    stated). Questions were straightforward but failed to probe critical areas (timeline,
    financial/legal stakes, caregiver motive), so coverage and quality are limited.'
