  evidence: 'VERSION 0-2 progression shows incremental refinement: truncated openings
    gradually expanded into fuller narrative. VERSION 3 (final) fully realizes all
    constraints. INTERNAL CONFLICT (constraint 1): Masterfully shown through physical
    manifestations—gripping paintbrush too hard, staring at paint chips, hands trembling—rather
    than exposition. The guilt/gratitude/grief emotional layering demonstrates genuine
    internal struggle. GRANDMOTHER MOMENT (constraint 2): The albondigas scene crystallizes
    everything. Abuela''s direct confrontation (''What''s wrong?''), Mateo''s confession,
    and her fierce response (''We didn''t do all that so you could stay here'') create
    the pivotal choice. The physical detail of flour and meat mixing between their
    hands grounds the emotional revelation. UNDERSTANDING ADULT (constraint 3): Mr.
    Chen''s monologue (''I got into college once...'') is perfectly calibrated—he
    doesn''t solve Mateo''s problem but validates the dilemma and models consequences.
    His final line (''don''t wait too long to put it down'') echoes through the grandmother
    scene. CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY (constraint 4): Details feel earned, not decorative.
    The insurance papers, speakerphone quinceañera argument, Danny''s absence at Christmas,
    Abuela''s reference to crossing the desert and working fields—these accumulate
    into genuine cultural texture. Code-switching between English/Spanish reflects
    actual bilingual experience. The mercado courtyard sketch connects personal ambition
    to community. EARNED RESOLUTION (constraint 5): Mateo doesn''t magically feel
    better. The guilt ''shifted into something else'' but doesn''t vanish. His commitment
    to Sunday calls and Abuela''s fierce blessing show growth through acceptance of
    complexity, not through easy answers. The final line returns to domestic normalcy,
    grounding the emotional arc. TRAJECTORY: V0 establishes setup but feels incomplete.
    V1-2 add Berkeley letter and ASU deception, raising stakes. V3 expands Mr. Chen
    scene (crucial for adult understanding) and transforms the albondigas moment from
    simple cooking lesson into emotional reckoning. Each revision deepens rather than
    replaces. PRESERVATION: Core elements (hardware store, phone buzz, heat metaphor,
    Berkeley letter, ASU lie) maintained throughout while surrounding narrative gains
    specificity and emotional weight.'
