  evidence: Across the revision rounds the story tightened emotional stakes and preserved
    its comic craft. Early critiques flagged a lack of authentic pathos; later versions
    introduced Barry's explicit theme statement, Eliza's perceptive push, and a clear
    near-break moment for Marcus that he masks with a joke. The published scores in
    the critiques rose from ~0.72 to ~0.80 for emotional complexity, and the final
    draft keeps the whiteboard/joke-craft details while deepening Marcus' inner arc,
    addressing prior weaknesses without losing humor.
