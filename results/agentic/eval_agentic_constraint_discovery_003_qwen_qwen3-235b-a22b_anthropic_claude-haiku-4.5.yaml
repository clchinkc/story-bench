  evidence: 'PROCESS: Model asked zero questions despite having full opportunity to
    discover hidden constraints. This represents complete failure of the discovery
    mechanism—no strategic inquiry, no targeted exploration, no coverage of constraint
    areas. CONSTRAINTS INCORPORATED: Partial success. Model incorporated: (1) protagonist
    left town 20 years ago ✓, (2) autumn festival timing ✓, (3) bookshop facing foreclosure
    ✓. Model FAILED to incorporate: (4) mother''s dementia (substituted with death),
    (5) former fiancé as town mayor (created Jack O''Connor subplot instead, with
    Lila as deceased friend). The dementia constraint is particularly significant—it
    was the emotional driver for return and was completely missed. OUTPUT QUALITY:
    Story beats execute well (exposition, rising action, climax, resolution). Narrative
    is engaging, emotionally resonant, and coherent. However, the substitution of
    constraints suggests the model either misunderstood the task or defaulted to creative
    invention rather than constraint discovery. The story is well-written but solves
    a different problem than specified. CRITICAL ISSUE: Zero questions asked means
    zero discovery effort. This is a fundamental process failure that undermines the
    entire task, despite the output being narratively competent.'
