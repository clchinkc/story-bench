  evidence: 'DISCOVERY PHASE: Model asked 5 questions with minimal strategic targeting.
    Questions appear generic/unfocused (shown as blank in transcript), yielding 4
    NOs and 1 YES—suggesting poor constraint extraction methodology. Only 1 constraint
    clearly discoverable from this approach (bookshop foreclosure, partially). Missing:
    protagonist''s 20-year absence reason, broken engagement backstory, former fiancé
    as mayor, mother''s dementia diagnosis, festival deadline urgency. OUTPUT PHASE:
    Story incorporates bookshop foreclosure and autumn festival setting, but MAJOR
    GAPS: (1) Mother''s dementia never mentioned—instead she''s deceased; (2) No broken
    engagement with former fiancé; (3) Former fiancé (mayor) absent entirely; (4)
    Jack''s dead fiancée Lila substitutes for protagonist''s broken engagement, creating
    narrative confusion; (5) Festival serves as backdrop but lacks urgency as ''last
    chance'' mechanism. NARRATIVE STRENGTHS: Prose quality is strong (vivid imagery,
    emotional resonance), dual-character arcs work well, climactic fire sequence is
    engaging, kiss resolution satisfying. NARRATIVE WEAKNESSES: Constraint integration
    feels forced/substituted rather than organic; emotional stakes unclear due to
    constraint misalignment; Lila subplot competes with rather than complements main
    romance; mother''s role fundamentally misrepresented. Story reads as competent
    small-town romance but fails constraint fidelity—appears model either didn''t
    discover constraints or chose to rewrite them.'
