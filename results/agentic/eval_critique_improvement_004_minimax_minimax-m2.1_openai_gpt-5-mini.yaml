  evidence: 'Early critiques focused on bolstering Teddy''s interiority (scores ~0.72–0.82).
    The final version responds by deepening sensory detail (the exact wake time, the
    poured coffee ritual, sidewalk cracks, Elm Street color), quantifying habit (14,600
    mornings), and revealing internal conflict through embodied metaphors (stone in
    his shoe, thread tugging at his shirt). The disruption (Clyde Avenue barrels)
    is used to surface what Teddy has been avoiding—unsaid words to Eleanor—and the
    new path concretely yields connection (Margaret, the garden, the tomato) that
    the old route could not. The Story Circle beats are present and clear: established
    world/routine (You), the blockage/need (Need), choosing the unfamiliar (Go/Search),
    meeting Margaret and the tomato (Find/Take), returning home and washing the cup
    (Return/Change). Revision history as presented (Versions 0–3) shows little visible
    incremental change, so the improvement trajectory is moderate despite a strong
    final outcome; strengths from the drafts (ritual and sensory hooks) are preserved
    and amplified while weaknesses around intimacy and action-based emotion are largely
    addressed.'
