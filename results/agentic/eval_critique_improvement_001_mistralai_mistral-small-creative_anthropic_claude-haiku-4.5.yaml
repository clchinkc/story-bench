  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.7): The revisions show minimal textual changes
    across versions 0-3, suggesting limited responsiveness to critique feedback. The
    opening was refined (V0→V1: ''concealed'' to ''erased'', ''creaking'' simile added),
    but subsequent versions plateau. Critiques praised constraint satisfaction (0.8-0.95
    range), yet no evidence of deliberate strengthening in response. The final output
    appears to be V3 with extended narrative, not a revision addressing critique gaps.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.6): Quality shows modest gains V0→V1 (stronger verb
    choice, better simile), then stagnates V1→V3. The extended final narrative adds
    substantial content but represents expansion rather than iterative refinement.
    No clear evidence that critique scores (0.8 vs 0.95) prompted targeted improvements
    to the weaker constraint (methodical nature execution, which scored 0.8 in Critique
    1).


    PRESERVATION (0.8): Core strengths maintained throughout—fog imagery, Sarah''s
    notebook discipline, Elias''s secret, Mercer reveal. The methodical action sequences
    (''pen moved in precise strokes'', time/location notation) persist consistently.
    Atmospheric tension preserved. However, the extended narrative adds new material
    (cannery scene, drag marks) not present in earlier versions, suggesting some structural
    reworking rather than pure preservation.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.9/5 constraints):

    1. ✓ Methodical nature through action: ''pen moved in precise, unhurried strokes'',
    notebook entries with time/location/visibility—shown, not told

    2. ✓ Fog serves narrative purpose: obscures the jetty (prevents seeing shore),
    creates disorientation at cannery, forces decision-making (follow marks vs. return)

    3. ✓ Local character secret: Elias recognizes Mercer, hesitates, later reveals
    missing girl connection—clear secret arc

    4. ✓ Past case hinted before reveal: ''whispers about the case that got away''
    (para 2) precedes Mercer identification (para 5)

    5. ✓ Ends on decision, not resolution: Final line ''She turned from the drag marks.
    Elias had answers. The cannery would still be here.'' is a choice point, not closure


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.85): Three required beats present:

    - Beat 1 (Discovery): Body discovery at jetty, methodical observation ✓

    - Beat 2 (Investigation): Mercer identification, Elias interrogation, cannery
    exploration ✓

    - Beat 3 (Complication): Drag marks found, radio call about Elias, decision forced
    ✓

    Execution is clean but Beat 3 feels slightly rushed; the cannery scene compresses
    multiple discoveries into brief space.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.85): Prose is atmospheric and controlled. Dialogue feels
    authentic (''Hell no.'' / ''Might''ve''). Pacing accelerates appropriately. Sensory
    details (copper and rot, wool seeping cold) ground the reader. Minor weakness:
    the Mercer reveal paragraph (''Her fingers stilled...'') uses internal exposition
    (''The department had called it a setback'') that slightly breaks the show-don''t-tell
    principle established elsewhere. The final decision point is genuinely compelling
    and open-ended.


    OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The story successfully satisfies all constraints and executes
    required beats with strong atmospheric prose. However, the revision process shows
    limited responsiveness to critique—critiques were already highly positive (0.8-0.95),
    leaving little room for improvement, yet the writer didn''t use that feedback
    to push toward 1.0 territory. The extended final narrative appears to be new material
    rather than refinement of existing sections. Quality is solid (0.85) but not exceptional;
    the story would benefit from tightening the Mercer reveal exposition and deepening
    the cannery sequence.'
