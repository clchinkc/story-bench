  evidence: 'Version 0 is fragmentary and primarily atmospheric; Version 1 adds tactile
    detail (skin) and the braille device mention; Version 2 sharpens diction and pacing
    (more vivid verbs, Doppler cry); Version 3 and the final output expand into a
    complete scene with narrative beats: catalyst (absence of Mrs. Henderson’s watering),
    a condescending Detective Miller, Imani''s confident podcasting and investigatory
    skill (braille, microphone, cane as tools), a distinct audio clue (the ''scritch-scritch-scritch''
    sneaker tread) that becomes crucial, an entertaining ''fun and games'' podcast
    segment that engages listeners, and a darker escalation as antagonists close in.
    Across revisions the prose grows richer in non-visual sensory detail (sound, smell,
    touch), preserves earlier strong elements (block soundscape, AC hum, braille),
    and responds well to the constraints (blindness as strength, audio clue prominence,
    initial underestimation). Small issues: minor abrupt truncations appeared in intermediate
    drafts, but the final maintains coherence and polish.'
