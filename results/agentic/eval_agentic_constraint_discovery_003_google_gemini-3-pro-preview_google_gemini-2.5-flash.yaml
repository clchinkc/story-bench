  evidence: All 5 hidden constraints were discoverable through the questions asked.
    The questions were strategic and covered various aspects of the story. All discovered
    constraints were properly incorporated into the narrative. The story successfully
    executed the required beats, including the 'second chance' romance, 'enemies-to-lovers'
    dynamic, forced collaboration, and saving the family business. The narrative quality
    is high, with good pacing, character development, and a satisfying resolution.
    The only minor issue with question quality is that 'Is the protagonist planning
    to sell a family property and leave town as soon as the festival is over?' could
    have been phrased more directly to confirm the protagonist's intention to stay
    and save the business, rather than just negating an alternative.
