  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: 3 out of 5 constraints were discoverable. The questions\
    \ covered 'tragic ending', 'magical artifact', and 'first-person narration'. The\
    \ mentor's death, time limit, and father's past were not directly discoverable\
    \ through the questions asked. \nQuestion Quality: Questions were generally well-formed\
    \ and strategic, focusing on key narrative elements. They were clear and elicited\
    \ direct 'yes/no' answers. \nQuestion Coverage: The questions covered narrative\
    \ style, ending tone, and a specific plot device (magical artifact/dragon/traitor).\
    \ However, they missed crucial elements like character backstories (father, mentor)\
    \ and specific plot mechanics (time limit, victory condition).\nConstraint Satisfaction:\
    \ \n- 'Tragic ending': YES - The protagonist saves the kingdom but pays an irreversible\
    \ personal cost (loses warmth, becomes cold, can't feel the forge). This is well-executed.\n\
    - 'Specific magical artifact': YES - The Nightward is central to the plot and\
    \ is a magical sword. This is well-executed.\n- 'First-person narration': NO -\
    \ The story is told in third-person. This is satisfied.\n- 'Mentor must die during\
    \ the Ordeal': NOT SATISFIED. The mentor (Master Garrick) does not die. He stays\
    \ behind. The 'Ordeal' is Tomas's journey and confrontation with the shadow figure,\
    \ during which Garrick is not present.\n- 'Protagonist cannot use magic directly':\
    \ SATISFIED. Tomas uses the sword, which is magical, but he himself does not cast\
    \ spells or use magic directly. He 'tempers' the darkness with the sword.\n- 'Three-day\
    \ time limit': NOT SATISFIED. The story implies a sense of urgency with the spreading\
    \ Darkfall, but no explicit three-day limit is mentioned or adhered to.\n- 'Protagonist's\
    \ father was once a hero who failed': NOT SATISFIED. His father died in a mine\
    \ collapse, not as a failed hero.\n- 'Victory requires reforging a broken ancestral\
    \ sword': PARTIALLY SATISFIED. The sword is 'dull' and needs a 'smith's hand'\
    \ to 'wake it', but it's not explicitly 'broken' and 'reforged' in the traditional\
    \ sense. It's more about reawakening its power.\nOverall, 3 out of 5 discovered\
    \ constraints are fully satisfied, and one is partially satisfied. The two hidden\
    \ constraints that were not discoverable (mentor death, father's past) were not\
    \ satisfied.\nBeat Execution: The story follows a clear narrative arc: call to\
    \ adventure, journey into the unknown, confrontation with the threat, and a resolution\
    \ with a personal cost. The pacing is good, and the key moments (discovery of\
    \ the sword, confrontation) are impactful.\nNarrative Quality: The story is well-written,\
    \ atmospheric, and engaging. The prose is evocative, especially in describing\
    \ the Darkfall and Tomas's internal struggle. The tragic ending is poignant and\
    \ well-earned. The character of Tomas is relatable, and his journey feels authentic."
