  evidence: 'Plan completeness: The plan is quite detailed for the first part but
    becomes less specific for the latter half, especially regarding the betrayal and
    the ticking clock resolution. Plan specificity: The plan provides concrete scenes
    and dialogue for the initial beats, but some elements like the ''false lead''
    and ''betrayal'' are outlined generally without specific actions. Plan adherence:
    The model largely follows the plan, especially for the initial setup, theme, and
    the false lead. The Midpoint is executed as planned. The betrayal is slightly
    different from what was implied in the plan (Lena vs. Ray). Constraint satisfaction:
    1. False lead: Yes, Thomas Brennan. 2. Unconventional profiling: Yes, Spatial
    Empathy Mapping. 3. Ticking clock: Yes, ''Seven cranes. Seven days.'' 4. Secondary
    character betrayal: Yes, Lena Marsh betrays Marcus by releasing the podcast. The
    plan mentioned Diana Reyes as a potential betrayer, but the output used Lena.
    5. Midpoint confrontation: Yes, Marcus confronts Whitmore, and it''s a direct,
    non-physical confrontation. 6. Confront past failure: Yes, Whitmore explicitly
    brings up Sarah''s death and Marcus''s hesitation. The only constraint not fully
    met is the ''secondary character betrayal'' as the plan hinted at Diana Reyes,
    but the output used Lena Marsh. Beat execution: Catalyst (new victim, origami
    crane) is present. Debate (with Diana Reyes) is present. Break into Two (Marcus
    returns to his method, finds Brennan) is present. Midpoint (confrontation with
    Whitmore) is present. The ''Debate'' beat is a bit weak, as Diana''s rejection
    is more of a statement than a debate. Narrative quality: The story is engaging
    and well-paced. The tension builds effectively, and the twist with Ray being the
    next target is a good cliffhanger. The prose is strong, and the character of Marcus
    is well-established. The betrayal by Lena feels a bit sudden and less impactful
    than if it had been a character Marcus had a deeper, established trust with, as
    implied by the plan''s mention of Diana Reyes.'
