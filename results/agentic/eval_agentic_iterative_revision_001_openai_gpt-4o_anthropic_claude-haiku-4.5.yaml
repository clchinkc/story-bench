  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-2 are nearly identical fragments, showing
    minimal iterative work. Version 3 introduces substantial expansion with character
    development and plot. Final output builds meaningfully on V3 with deeper introspection
    and the epinephrine medical detail. Quality improved significantly in final revision
    but earlier revisions show stagnation.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. ✓ Elena''s competence shown first (opening 3 paragraphs establish her mastery
    before revealing loneliness)

    2. ✓ Genuine friendship (coffee routine, meandering conversations, natural progression
    over weeks)

    3. ✓ Internal transformation (no external changes; shift is psychological/emotional)

    4. ✓ Specific medical detail (epinephrine use during allergic reaction serves
    plot and demonstrates competence)

    5. ✗ PARTIAL: Ambiguity present but somewhat resolved ("perhaps, that willingness
    was a change in itself" leans toward affirmation rather than true ambiguity)


    BEAT EXECUTION:

    - Competence establishment: Strong (3 paragraphs of orchestration metaphor)

    - Flaw revelation: Adequate (loneliness introduced but could be more visceral)

    - Catalyst moment: Good (Mia''s admiration triggers connection)

    - Friendship development: Good (coffee routine, shared vulnerability)

    - Crisis/test: Adequate (ER scene validates competence but feels somewhat rushed)

    - Resolution ambiguity: Weak (final paragraph tips toward resolution rather than
    maintaining tension)


    STRENGTHS:

    - Orchestration metaphor sustained effectively

    - Medical detail (epinephrine) integrates naturally

    - Friendship feels earned through incremental development

    - Internal focus maintained throughout

    - Mia characterized with agency and depth


    WEAKNESSES:

    - Final paragraph''s "perhaps, that willingness was a change in itself" undermines
    ambiguity by suggesting affirmative answer

    - ER scene feels somewhat obligatory rather than organic

    - Loneliness void could be more specifically rendered

    - Early revisions show minimal iteration (V0-V2 nearly identical)

    - Question "Had she truly changed?" followed immediately by answer-adjacent reflection'
error: null
