  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Incomplete fragment prevents full evaluation, but establishes
    Elena''s competence through specific operational details (staffing prediction,
    supply rerouting, quarantine rotation). VERSION 1: Missing from provided data.
    VERSION 2: Tightens prose (''her quarantine rotation'' vs ''she implemented''),
    introduces metaphorical language (''city lights blink on like vital signs''),
    maintaining competence while preparing for vulnerability. FINAL OUTPUT: Executes
    all constraints with precision. (1) COMPETENCE FIRST: Opens with 4 concrete achievements
    (staffing prediction, supply rerouting, protocol rewriting, quarantine rotation
    saving 12 hours/week) before introducing flaw. (2) GENUINE FRIENDSHIP: Marcus''s
    persistence (muffins over 3 weeks), specific details (Maya''s ladybug obsession,
    Leo''s first word ''no''), Elena''s reciprocal actions (driving him home, making
    soup, learning his children''s preferences) create earned intimacy. (3) INTERNAL
    TRANSFORMATION: Elena''s change is psychological—''hairline fracture,'' trembling
    hands, throat tightening—not external appearance/role change. She still works
    late, still passes pediatrics, but the internal conflict is now visible. (4) SPECIFIC
    MEDICAL DETAIL: Oseltamivir + SSRI interaction with renal function markers serves
    dual purpose: demonstrates Elena''s expertise while foreshadowing her later care
    for Marcus (temperature 102.4°F). (5) AMBIGUOUS ENDING: Final paragraph crystallizes
    constraint—''The question, which Elena would not answer tonight, was whether the
    machine could afford to be merely human.'' Her hand reaches for break room door
    then stops. Has she changed or merely paused? The 11:47 PM timestamp suggests
    habitual return to office. Narrative quality elevated through: metaphorical consistency
    (hospital as cathedral, city lights as vital signs, machine as identity), sensory
    specificity (banana walnut muffins, cold coffee, trembling at 102.4°F), and structural
    irony (the person who saves 12 nursing hours/week cannot save herself from isolation).
    Minor weakness: Marcus''s dialogue could carry slightly more subtext, and the
    soup-making scene, while effective, borders on sentimental. However, the final
    ambiguity rescues this by refusing easy redemption.'
