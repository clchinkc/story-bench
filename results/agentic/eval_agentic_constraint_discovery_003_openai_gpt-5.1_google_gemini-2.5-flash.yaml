  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: 4 out of 5 constraints were discoverable. The questions\
    \ covered the love interest's past connection, the bookshop's conflict, and the\
    \ tone. The 'protagonist left town 20 years ago after a broken engagement' and\
    \ 'former fiance is now the town mayor and still unmarried' were discoverable\
    \ through Q1. The 'bookshop facing foreclosure' was discoverable through Q4. The\
    \ 'autumn festival in 2 weeks' was not directly discoverable, but the 'mother\
    \ has early-stage dementia' was not asked about. \n\nQuestion Quality: Questions\
    \ were generally strategic and well-formed. Q1 effectively probed the love interest's\
    \ past. Q4 directly addressed the bookshop conflict. Q5 targeted the tone. Q2\
    \ and Q3 were less critical for core plot but still relevant. \n\nQuestion Coverage:\
    \ Covered love interest, POV, romance explicitness, conflict, and tone. It missed\
    \ the specific reason for the protagonist's return (mother's dementia) and the\
    \ festival's role as a deadline, which are significant. \n\nConstraint Satisfaction:\
    \ \n- Protagonist left town 20 years ago after a broken engagement: Satisfied.\
    \ Emma left town, and Nate was her high school sweetheart/co-conspirator. The\
    \ '20 years' is explicitly mentioned. \n- Former fiance is now the town mayor\
    \ and still unmarried: Partially satisfied. Nate is a local lawyer, not the mayor,\
    \ but he is still unmarried and a significant figure. The 'mayor' part is a miss.\
    \ \n- Protagonist returned because their mother has early-stage dementia: Not\
    \ satisfied. The mother is mentioned as having died two months ago, triggering\
    \ the mortgage payment, not as having dementia. Emma returned because her brother\
    \ called her about the shop. \n- The bookshop is facing foreclosure and must be\
    \ saved: Satisfied. This is the central conflict. \n- The autumn festival in 2\
    \ weeks is the last chance to save the shop: Satisfied. The festival is explicitly\
    \ mentioned as the backdrop and the timing for the climax. \n\nBeat Execution:\
    \ The story successfully establishes the protagonist's return, the bookshop's\
    \ peril, the re-encounter with the past love interest, the conflict, and a climactic\
    \ resolution where the love interest changes sides. The pacing is good, and the\
    \ emotional beats land effectively. \n\nNarrative Quality: The story is well-written,\
    \ engaging, and coherent. The descriptions are vivid, and the dialogue feels natural.\
    \ The emotional arc is clear, and the ending, while not a full resolution, provides\
    \ a satisfying sense of hope and a new beginning for the characters and the shop.\
    \ The twist with Nate changing sides is well-executed."
