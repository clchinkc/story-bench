  evidence: 'The plan is very detailed and covers all constraints and beats. The final
    output adheres closely to the plan, with only minor deviations (e.g., the mentor''s
    dialogue is slightly different but maintains the same core message). All constraints
    are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through specific behaviors (automated gift
    card, cold food, staring at forehead, packing only equipment, noise-canceling
    headphones, ''human protocols won''t help''). The alien signal feels genuinely
    alien (''meta-language that rewrites itself,'' ''prime number sequences...formed
    a breathing rhythm,'' ''intentional silences...syntax,'' ''message about humanity,
    recorded by observers''). Kael challenges Yuki''s approach (''Your models are
    perfect...perfectly empty,'' ''What if the key isn''t in your head, but in the
    space *between* heads?''). Mira is an unconventional mentor (''82-year-old Inuit
    woman,'' ''The ice doesn''t speak in words. It speaks in what it remembers,''
    ''You''re the first one running from being human''). The Threshold is psychological
    (Yuki''s realization that her isolation is a ''methodological failure'' and her
    need for ''genuine human connection parameters''). The moment of genuine human
    connection is when Kael sits beside her, and she doesn''t flinch, and then her
    decision to call her sister. All beats are clearly executed.'
