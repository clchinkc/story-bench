  evidence: 'PLAN STRENGTHS: Comprehensive beat-by-beat outline addresses all four
    required story beats. Plan identifies unconventional mentor (poet-scientist hybrid)
    and includes challenging colleague (Dr. Quasar). Psychological threshold is clearly
    articulated. PLAN WEAKNESSES: Plan lacks specificity on how isolation will be
    shown through behaviors—mostly lists behaviors rather than dramatizing them. Alien
    signal description is vague; plan doesn''t specify what makes it genuinely alien
    vs. anthropomorphic. Missing concrete details on the human connection moment.
    EXECUTION STRENGTHS: All four beats present and functional. Isolation shown through
    concrete behaviors (eating alone, avoiding eye contact, dimly lit office, stale
    coffee). Mentor unconventional (poet-scientist with warm demeanor). Colleague
    challenges approach. Psychological threshold crossed (Yuki confronts fear of connection).
    Human connection moment (Dr. Singh''s story) surprises Yuki and cracks her shell.
    EXECUTION WEAKNESSES: Alien signal remains underspecified—described as ''mathematical-poetic
    construct'' but lacks genuine alienness; feels more like human poetry than truly
    alien. The signal''s nature isn''t sufficiently differentiated from human communication
    patterns. Isolation behaviors are stated but not deeply dramatized through scene
    work. The moment of human connection, while present, feels somewhat rushed and
    told rather than shown through dialogue/interaction. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Pacing
    is competent but uneven. Opening is strong with sensory details. Middle section
    becomes exposition-heavy when introducing the team. Climactic breakthrough feels
    somewhat generic. Ending is reflective but lacks tension. The story reads as competent
    but safe—it hits required beats without taking risks or creating genuine surprise.'
