  evidence: 'The plan addresses most constraints and beats, though some details could
    be more specific. The final output largely follows the plan. All beats are present
    and well-executed. Most constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through
    behavior (long nights, wary of interface, fidgeting, walling herself off), the
    alien signal feels genuinely alien (shimmering code, patterns defying human languages,
    vibrant cryptic motifs), Kamal challenges her approach directly, Morano is unconventional
    (ancient scholar, old European dialects, hand-drawn maps, ancient stones), and
    there''s a moment of human connection with Kamal. The psychological threshold
    is present but could be stronger; it''s more of a gradual shift than a distinct
    ''crossing'' moment. The narrative quality is good, with decent pacing and character
    development.'
