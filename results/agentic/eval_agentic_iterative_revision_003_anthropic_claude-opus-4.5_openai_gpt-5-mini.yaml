  evidence: 'V0 was a fragment ending at the Cal-Tech notice. V1 added stakes (the
    jar labeled for MIT fees, Mateo''s roles at home) clarifying his obligations.
    V2 made a small prop change (rosary -> Selena CDs) but preserved the saving motif
    and sense of being the one who stayed. The Final version expands into a full story:
    the acceptance email, a crystallizing kitchen scene with Abuelita recounting her
    lost opportunity, Mr. Padilla''s moment of empathy, Mateo''s tangible actions
    (counting savings, writing an envelope, thumb hovering, pressing accept), and
    the departure at the station. Overall the revisions move from incomplete to a
    cohesive, emotionally earned resolution while keeping core imagery (heat, hardware
    store, savings jar) intact.'
