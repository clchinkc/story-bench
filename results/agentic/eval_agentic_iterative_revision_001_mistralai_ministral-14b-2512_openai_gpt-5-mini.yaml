  evidence: 'Across versions the piece clearly improves: Version 0 establishes Elena''s
    competence but cuts off abruptly and is mostly telling; Version 1 tightens voice
    and begins to hint at loneliness; Version 2 adds sensory detail and deepens the
    narrator''s perspective; Version 3 and the final draft consolidate those gains
    into a coherent arc. The final version preserves Elena''s professional competence
    from the first drafts while adding concrete beats (Dr. Chen''s interventions,
    the ventilator filter clog, the pediatric H3N2/cytokine storm headline) that both
    complicate her competence and catalyze her internal shift. Dialogue and short
    sentences punctuate emotional beats, and the friendship with Chen evolves through
    action (him helping a child, reorganizing crash carts, telling her about her sister)
    rather than exposition, which makes it feel earned though slightly compact. The
    transformation is shown inwardly (she starts asking and learning instead of only
    managing), the medical detail is specific and plot-relevant, and the ending leaves
    her future ambiguous—she faces competing calls to duty and family. Minor weaknesses:
    the friendship could use one additional small, domestic detail to make it fully
    rounded, and the internal shift, while present and credible, is brief given the
    crisis timeline.'
