  evidence: 'VERSION 0-2 appear truncated/identical (incomplete fragments), making
    trajectory assessment difficult for early revisions. VERSION 3→FINAL shows clear
    refinement: prose tightens (badge/sigh opening), medical specificity deepens (BiPAP/Airvo/high-flow
    nasal cannula details integrated functionally into plot), and emotional architecture
    solidifies. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Competence established extensively—overflow
    cots, N95 rerouting, negative pressure room management, translator coordination,
    all before flaw introduction ✓ (2) Friendship earned through repeated small moments—cafecito,
    conchas, Arturo''s mother, 3am cannula sorting, radio for patients—feels organic
    and reciprocal ✓ (3) Transformation internal: Elena moves from isolation (''everything
    leaned toward her'') to considering connection (''Maybe''), no external role/appearance
    change ✓ (4) Medical detail (BiPAP/Airvo/high-flow nasal cannula protocol) serves
    plot directly—Arturo''s clinical decision creates trust moment, establishes his
    competence as mirror to hers ✓ (5) Ending ambiguous: ''Maybe'' + cursor hovering
    + ''didn''t look away'' leaves genuine uncertainty whether this is sustainable
    change or momentary weakness ✓. BEAT EXECUTION: Competence montage (first 4 paragraphs)
    is crisp and specific. Flaw introduction (''by two, the flaw slid in'') is well-signposted
    and psychologically credible. Friendship development spans multiple encounters
    with escalating intimacy. Final moment balances hope with doubt effectively. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Prose is consistently strong—metaphors (hospital as feverish creature,
    train metaphor for momentum) work without overreaching. Dialogue feels natural.
    Pacing accelerates appropriately. Minor: ''resilience'' meeting feels slightly
    on-the-nose as avoidance mechanism, though it works. The final image (cursor hovering,
    ''didn''t look away'') is genuinely strong—visual and emotional simultaneously.'
