  evidence: Across three revision rounds the text shows only incremental surface edits
    (tightening of phrasing, small clarifications) rather than targeted responses
    to the detailed youth-voice critiques. The critiques highlighted occasional adult/technical
    phrasing and urged stronger consistent childlike register; the final version retains
    most of the original strengths (visceral reactions, raw outbursts) but also keeps
    some slightly advanced/technical lines, indicating limited responsiveness. The
    revision trajectory improved clarity and pacing modestly (v0→v1 removed some clunky
    bits; v1→v3 mostly preserved those gains) but did not materially rework problematic
    lines. Strengths—Zara’s inventive Glint-Seeker, clear stakes, Silas’s defined
    flaw, and the dangerous crossing—were preserved and in some places emphasized,
    yielding a solid scene with vivid worldbuilding and believable stakes, but the
    author missed an opportunity to more thoroughly tune the narrative voice to sound
    unmistakably twelve throughout.
