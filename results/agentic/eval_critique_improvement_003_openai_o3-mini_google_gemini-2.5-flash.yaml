  evidence: The revisions show a clear effort to address the 'youth_voice' critiques,
    moving from a more adult-sounding narration to a more authentic 12-year-old perspective.
    The final version successfully incorporates all constraints. The initial dismissal
    by Mr. Delgado is present, Ms. Marlowe is a flawed mentor (fear of past mistakes),
    Zara's Salvage Seeker is her invention, and the crossing is genuinely dangerous.
    Zara's competence is shown through her actions and invention, without being unrealistic.
    The narrative quality improved significantly in terms of voice and constraint
    integration. The 'hope_balance' is well-maintained, and the worldbuilding feels
    consistent. The beat execution is mostly good, though the 'Call to Adventure'
    and 'Refusal of the Call' are somewhat blended and less distinct than they could
    be.
