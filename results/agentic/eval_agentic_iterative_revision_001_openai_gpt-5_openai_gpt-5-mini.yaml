  evidence: 'V0–V2 are essentially identical stubs showing only an efficient, managerial
    Elena; V3 introduces concrete revision: more sensory detail, specific actions
    (rerouting N95s, moving cots) and the beginning of interpersonal scenes. The final
    expands V3 into a coherent arc that preserves the opening competence beat while
    adding the flaw (silencing the board, avoiding social invitations) and the earned
    friendship with Arturo through small, believable gestures (concha, his mother
    calling, shared clinical habits). Specific medical details (BiPAP aerosolization
    risk, Airvo high-flow nasal cannula at 50 L/min, negative-pressure rooms, intubation,
    oxygen saturation rising from 88 to 94) are integrated and drive decisions. Elena''s
    transformation is internal—her hesitation, craving of being expected, and the
    single-word admission ''No''—and the story closes ambiguously with ''Maybe'' and
    the cursor hovering, leaving open whether she has truly changed. Overall quality
    improves markedly from the initial truncated versions to a polished, constraint-satisfying
    final; small losses are only slight rephrasing choices but core elements were
    preserved and strengthened.'
