  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-2 show incremental refinement in sensory
    detail and pacing (desert heat, specific objects, Spanish integration). Version
    3 (final) adds emotional stakes and the grandmother scene, representing meaningful
    progress. However, the narrative cuts off mid-sentence during the climactic father-son
    exchange, undermining the earned resolution requirement.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    ✓ INTERNAL CONFLICT SHOWN: Mateo''s torn loyalty between family duty and adolescent
    freedom is demonstrated through his phone hesitation, the torn flyer, and physical
    descriptions (tired face, raw voice). This is shown through action/choice rather
    than exposition.

    ✓ GRANDMOTHER CRYSTALLIZING MOMENT: The abuela''s question ''Y tú, ¿qué hiciste?''
    serves as the turning point. Her understanding gaze and the *Virgen de Guadalupe*
    apron ground this emotionally.

    ✓ ADULT UNDERSTANDING: Abuela genuinely comprehends Mateo''s dilemma—she doesn''t
    scold but asks reflective questions, suggesting she''s lived similar conflicts.

    ✗ CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY: Mixed execution. Spanish integration feels natural (guayabera,
    *receta*, *tienda*, *Virgen de Guadalupe*), but some elements feel slightly performative
    (the perfectly timed *arroz con pollo* explanation, the convenient flyer). The
    family dynamics ring true, but the cultural specificity could deepen.

    ✗ EARNED RESOLUTION: CRITICAL FAILURE. The narrative ends mid-sentence during
    the father confrontation. The choice to ''stay here'' is stated but not earned
    through demonstrated growth. We don''t see Mateo articulate his reasoning, reconcile
    duty with identity, or show transformation. The resolution is *announced* rather
    than *lived*.


    BEAT EXECUTION:

    - Setup (duty/exhaustion): Strong opening with sensory details

    - Inciting incident (Leo''s text): Present but underdeveloped

    - Turning point (abuela''s question): Well-executed

    - Crisis (torn flyer): Effective visual metaphor

    - Climax (father conversation): INCOMPLETE—cuts off before resolution

    - Resolution: Missing entirely


    NARRATIVE QUALITY ISSUES:

    - Incomplete ending severely undermines impact (0.3 penalty)

    - Strong voice and cultural specificity in dialogue

    - Effective use of objects as emotional anchors (guayabera, flyer, apron)

    - Pacing accelerates appropriately through revisions

    - Final version shows best character work but worst structural execution


    FEEDBACK RESPONSIVENESS:

    The revisions show attention to sensory grounding and character interiority, but
    the incomplete final draft suggests either time constraints or uncertainty about
    the resolution. The writer successfully integrated feedback about showing conflict
    and adding the grandmother scene, but failed to complete the earned resolution
    arc.'
  critical_issues:
  - 'INCOMPLETE NARRATIVE: Final output cuts off mid-sentence during climactic scene'
  - 'UNEARNED RESOLUTION: Mateo''s choice is stated but not demonstrated through growth'
  - 'MISSING CLIMAX: Father-son dialogue that should crystallize Mateo''s transformation
    is absent'
  strengths:
  - Authentic voice and dialogue integration
  - Effective grandmother scene with genuine understanding
  - Strong internal conflict shown through action
  - Sensory details improve across revisions
  - Cultural elements mostly feel organic
error: null
