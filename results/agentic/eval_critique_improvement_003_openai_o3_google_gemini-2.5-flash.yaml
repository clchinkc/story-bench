  evidence: The revisions successfully addressed the 'youth_voice' critiques. The
    initial versions had some adult-sounding narration, which was largely removed
    or rephrased to better fit Zara's perspective. For example, the line 'Hope was
    basically her video game' was identified as less authentic and was either removed
    or rephrased to 'Each fresh page made her ribs fizz, like soda bubbles under her
    skin. That had to be what hope felt like.' This change significantly improved
    the authenticity of Zara's voice. The preservation of strong elements like 'I'm
    twelve, not two' and the technical curiosity was also evident. The story maintained
    its strengths while refining the identified weaknesses.
