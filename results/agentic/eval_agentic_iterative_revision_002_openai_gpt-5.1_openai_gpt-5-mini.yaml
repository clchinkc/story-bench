  evidence: 'Quality improves clearly across versions. V0 establishes a solid sensory
    opening but is more general. V1 introduces practical details (metal tray under
    the AC, headphone adjustment), V2 tightens specificity (the same car stalling
    at the light) and V3/final adds strong tactile and olfactory details (irregular
    plink-plink on a baking sheet, cumin-scented steam, warm foam smelling of coconut
    oil) and a decisive audio element (the three short beeps pattern). The revisions
    preserve the voice and listening-focused approach while building the crucial audio
    clue and deepening Imani’s portrayal as competent and empowered. The Fun-and-Games
    beat is entertaining (teasing, empanadas, phone-tone prediction) before turning
    dark with the emergency demo permit, and one character (Detective Wolfe) initially
    underestimates Imani. Minor note: the audio clue is made pivotal and drives action
    but its full resolution is still forthcoming in the excerpt.'
