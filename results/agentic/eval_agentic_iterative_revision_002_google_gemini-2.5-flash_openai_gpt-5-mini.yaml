  evidence: 'Version 0 presented a strong sensory opening but was only a fragment.
    Versions 1 and 2 made minimal tweaks; version 3 added tactile detail (soundboard
    surface, snug headphones). The final expanded the fragment into a full scene:
    it preserved the original sensory atmosphere while adding the explicit audio clue
    (click-hiss every 14.7s, drone hum, camera shutter, man speaking numbers), a respectful
    depiction of Imani''s blindness as an auditory strength (Braille display, ''see
    with sound''), an underestimating character (Mark), and a clear ''fun and games''
    investigative phase that turns ominous with the drone and surveillance implication.
    Overall the piece improved from a promising excerpt to a coherent, well-paced
    scene with only minor stylistic clichés, hence a high but not perfect narrative
    score.'
