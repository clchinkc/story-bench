  evidence: The initial versions focused heavily on Elena's competence, with each
    revision refining the language to be more impactful and concise. Version 3 successfully
    established her competence and hinted at her internal state. The final output
    then built upon this strong foundation, introducing the flaw, developing the friendship,
    and addressing the remaining constraints. The medical detail was integrated smoothly,
    and the ending achieved the desired ambiguity. The only constraint not fully met
    was the 'genuine and earned' friendship, which felt a bit rushed in its development.
