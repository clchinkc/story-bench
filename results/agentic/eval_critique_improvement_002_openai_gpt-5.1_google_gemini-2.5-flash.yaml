  evidence: The critiques highlighted the effective balance of humor and pathos, and
    the constraint satisfaction. The revisions, though not explicitly detailed in
    the provided text, seem to have maintained and refined these elements. The final
    output successfully delivers on all constraints, particularly the humor before
    sadness, the theme stated by a minor character (Margo), the craft of comedy writing,
    the new writer's perceptiveness, and Marcus's near-break moment. The emotional
    complexity is well-handled, showing Marcus's internal struggle beneath a veneer
    of comedic genius. The writers' room feels authentic, and the characters of Marcus
    and Lena are well-developed, especially Lena's quick assessment of Marcus. The
    beats are present, though perhaps not explicitly 'Save the Cat' beats, the narrative
    flow is strong.
