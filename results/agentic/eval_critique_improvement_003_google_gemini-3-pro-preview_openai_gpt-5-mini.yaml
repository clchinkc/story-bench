  evidence: 'Across revisions the fragment becomes clearer and more concrete. V0 is
    a thin, cut-off image; V1 introduces purposeful action and the lever detail; V3
    adds stronger sensory language and explicitly names and describes Zara''s invention,
    the ''Scrap-Snatcher,'' showing her practical ingenuity and believable limitations.
    Strengths (sensory detail, a plausible youthful impatience) are preserved and
    enhanced. However the submission remains incomplete—cuts off mid-sentence—so larger
    structural beats of the Hero''s Journey cannot be evaluated. Several explicit
    constraints are still missing: no adult dismissing her as ''just a kid,'' no mentor
    (let alone a specifically flawed one), and the required ''crossing'' with clearly
    articulated, non-token danger is not shown. Some adult-leaning narration also
    persists, limiting youth-voice authenticity.'
