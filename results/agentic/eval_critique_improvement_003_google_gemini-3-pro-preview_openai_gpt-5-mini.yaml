  evidence: 'Across revisions the author preserved strong kid-voiced moments (e.g.,
    “Come on, you stupid piece of junk”) while adding concrete, grounded details that
    address prior critiques: Zara’s invention (the Barnacles) is made explicit, Jax’s
    specific flaw (trauma/alcoholism and a prosthetic leg) appears, an adult (Councilman
    Miller) explicitly dismisses her as a kid, and the Shallows crossing is rendered
    as genuinely dangerous (hurricane, whirlpools, rising debris). These changes noticeably
    improved immediacy and stakes. Remaining issues: some lines retain an adult, systems-level
    tone (e.g., explanatory sentences about the vault or hydroponics), so youth_voice
    is improved but not fully consistent.'
