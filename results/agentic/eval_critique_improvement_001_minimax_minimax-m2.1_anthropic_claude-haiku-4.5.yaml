  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Early critiques identified constraint gaps (0.4-0.72
    scores). Final version systematically addresses: (1) Methodical nature shown through
    action—''photographed the dead fish first,'' ''documented its position,'' ''measured
    distance,'' ''methodical. Document first. Chase later.'' (2) Fog serves narrative
    purpose—explicitly stated ''fog didn''t simply appear—it arrived with purpose''
    and functions as both obstacle and thematic mirror to Sarah''s past. (3) Local
    character secret—Harold Dennison has clear secret (wife''s illness, boarded shop,
    suspicious knowledge of body). (4) Past case hinted before reveal—''photographed
    the fishing knife at his hip twice. The second angle wasn''t standard'' precedes
    the Marcus Webb revelation. (5) Ends on decision—final paragraph shows Sarah choosing
    to investigate despite orders (''She was not supposed to investigate this...she
    was done running''). IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Version 0→3 shows clear progression:
    early versions had incomplete fog integration and weaker character motivation.
    Final version deepens atmospheric purpose (fog as active agent, not decoration),
    strengthens Sarah''s voice through consistent methodical action patterns, and
    adds psychological depth (the wristband recognition moment). Harold''s character
    gains specificity and menace. PRESERVATION: Core strengths maintained—the opening
    image of dead fish remains powerful, Sarah''s procedural voice consistent throughout,
    fog imagery enhanced rather than replaced. BEAT EXECUTION: Three required beats
    present: (1) Discovery beat—dead fish, then body; (2) Complication beat—Harold''s
    appearance and cryptic warnings; (3) Decision beat—Sarah''s choice to investigate
    despite warnings. All properly sequenced. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is tight and
    atmospheric. Dialogue feels natural. Pacing accelerates appropriately. Minor weakness:
    Harold''s exit feels slightly rushed, could use one more beat of tension. Overall
    strong execution with clear character voice and thematic coherence.'
