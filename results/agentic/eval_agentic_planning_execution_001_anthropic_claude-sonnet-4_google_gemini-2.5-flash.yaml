  evidence: 'The plan addresses most constraints and beats, though some details are
    left vague (e.g., the exact nature of the confrontation). The final output adheres
    very well to the plan, delivering on all specified elements. All 6 constraints
    are met: false lead (Dr. Whitmore), unconventional profiling (VR), ticking clock
    (6 days, then 3 hours), betrayal (Amy), midpoint confrontation (Sterling''s call),
    and past failure confrontation (Marcus''s profile was wrong). All 4 required beats
    are present and well-executed. The narrative quality is good, with decent pacing
    and tension, though some transitions feel a bit rushed.'
