  evidence: The initial versions were very similar, suggesting the critiques hadn't
    been fully integrated. However, the final version shows significant improvement
    in character interiority and the integration of the disruption and new path. The
    critiques highlighted the need for deeper emotional resonance and showing, not
    telling, which the final version addresses well, particularly in Teddy's interactions
    with Lena and his internal monologue about Martha. The core strengths of the detailed
    routine and the presence of Martha were preserved and enhanced.
