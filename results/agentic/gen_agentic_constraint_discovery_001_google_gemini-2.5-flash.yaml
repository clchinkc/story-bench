  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: 'The chill had crept into Eldoria by degrees, a slow, insidious frost that
    stole the warmth from the sun and the life from the soil. Crops withered, streams
    murmured with ice even in late spring, and the once-vibrant kingdom muted to shades
    of grey. Elara, a young blacksmith’s apprentice, felt it most keenly in the forge.
    The iron, usually eager to yield to the hammer, now felt sluggish, cold, as if
    resisting the very essence of fire.


    “The metals are… weary, Elara,” her master, Borin, often grumbled, his brow furrowed
    with a worry deeper than failing harvests. “They’ve lost their song.”


    Elara understood. She had always possessed an unusual sensitivity to the metals
    she worked. To her, each ingot had a faint hum, a unique pulse. Lately, that pulse
    had grown faint, almost imperceptible. One frigid afternoon, while sifting through
    old scraps, her fingers brushed against a forgotten, tarnished locket. It was
    heavy, unlike any common metal, and strangely cold. As she picked it up, a faint
    warmth sparked against her palm, a flicker of something familiar yet ancient.
    She cleaned it, revealing intricate, swirling patterns that seemed to glow faintly,
    like embers.


    That night, Borin found her tracing the locket’s design. His eyes widened. “That
    locket… it belonged to the Cinderblood line, your mother’s people. They weren’t
    just smiths, Elara. They were keepers of the world’s warmth, able to coax the
    Heartfire from the very earth.” He sighed, a cloud of mist in the cold forge.
    “The legends say when the world’s Heartfire dwindles, only a Cinderblood can rekindle
    it, forging a new conduit between the earth’s core and the fading sun.” He pointed
    to the locket. “This is your call, child. The darkness stealing our warmth isn''t
    a beast or a blight; it''s a silence, a fundamental decay at the heart of our
    world. And you, with the Cinderblood talent to hear the metal''s true song, are
    the only one who can find its missing melody.”


    Fear warred with a strange, undeniable pull. The locket pulsed in her hand, a
    tiny, insistent heartbeat. She looked at the dying embers in the forge, then at
    the vast, cold world outside. She was just an apprentice, but the warmth in her
    hand was a promise. "Where do I go?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper.


    Borin gave her an ancient, heavy hammer, its head gleaming with a dull, silver
    sheen. "To the Whispering Peaks, where the earth breathes its deepest secrets.
    The Heartfire''s last ember lies there, waiting for a true smith''s touch."


    With the Cinderblood locket clutched tight and the ancient hammer heavy in her
    grasp, Elara left the familiar warmth of the forge. The village watched her go,
    a small, solitary figure against the snow-laden fields. The air grew colder with
    each step, the trees skeletal and brittle. This was no longer the path to the
    market; it was a journey into the heart of the world’s despair. She was no longer
    just an apprentice; she was a forge-heart, venturing beyond the threshold of her
    known world.


    Days blurred into a frozen odyssey. Elara climbed the treacherous slopes of the
    Whispering Peaks, the wind tearing at her cloak. Finally, she reached a vast,
    ice-sheathed cavern, its depths glowing faintly with a cold, blue light. In its
    center, on a pedestal of ancient stone, lay a single, obsidian shard – the last
    ember of the Heartfire, its warmth all but extinguished. The air here was utterly
    dead, the silence profound. This was the Ordeal.


    Elara placed the locket on the pedestal beside the shard. Its faint glow intensified,
    a tiny beacon in the icy gloom. She took up the hammer. Her ancestral talent surged
    through her, a connection to the living essence of metal. She could feel the obsidian’s
    forgotten song, its desperate plea for heat. With every swing of the hammer, she
    didn''t just strike the shard; she poured her own spirit, her Cinderblood warmth,
    into it. Sparks, not of impact but of rekindled energy, flew from the obsidian.
    Her hands burned, her muscles screamed, but she pushed through, remembering Borin’s
    words, remembering the dying kingdom. She was forging a link, coaxing the deep,
    forgotten heat from the earth''s core, channeling it through the cold shard.


    Finally, with a resonant clang that echoed through the cavern, the obsidian shard
    pulsed with a fiery, golden light. The ice around it cracked, steam rising in
    shimmering plumes. The cavern filled with warmth, a sensation so profound it brought
    tears to Elara’s eyes. She had not merely struck metal; she had struck the world''s
    heart, awakening its song once more. The Heartfire blazed anew, a promise of warmth
    returning to Eldoria.'
