  evidence: 'The critiques primarily focused on the ''youth_voice'' criterion, suggesting
    Zara''s internal monologue occasionally felt too mature. While the revisions didn''t
    drastically alter the core narrative, they subtly refined Zara''s dialogue and
    internal thoughts to better align with a 12-year-old''s perspective. Phrases like
    ''Then I''ll have tried'' and her initial interactions with Harkin feel more authentically
    youthful. The core strengths of the story (worldbuilding, plot, character dynamics)
    were preserved throughout. The final version successfully addresses the youth_voice
    concerns without sacrificing other elements. All 5 constraints are clearly met:
    Zara is competent but not unrealistically so, Harkin initially dismisses her,
    Harkin is flawed (given up hope), the Tide Keeper is her invention, and the crossing
    is genuinely dangerous.'
