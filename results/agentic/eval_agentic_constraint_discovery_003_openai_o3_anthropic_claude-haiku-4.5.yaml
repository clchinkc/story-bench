  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Only 2 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q2 correctly identified the supporting character
    type constraint (Jamie as childhood friend/single parent), yielding a YES. However,
    the remaining 4 constraints were fundamentally unaddressable: Q1 (POV) and Q3
    (tone/style) were correctly answered NO but didn''t probe deeper; Q4 and Q5 were
    answered NO but missed critical plot elements. The questions lacked strategic
    depth—they should have asked about: specific character relationships (broken engagement,
    mayor), family circumstances (dementia), business stakes (foreclosure), or time-sensitive
    events (2-week deadline). QUESTION QUALITY: Moderately weak. Questions were well-formed
    but not strategically targeted. They covered broad categories (POV, character
    types, tone, settings, plot twists) but failed to drill into relationship dynamics,
    personal stakes, or time pressure. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Only 1 of 5 constraints
    properly incorporated. The story includes Jamie as a single parent (discovered),
    but MISSING: (1) 20-year absence after broken engagement—Evelyn left 7 years ago
    for Boston, not 20 years ago after engagement; (2) former fiancé as mayor—no mayor
    character appears; (3) mother''s dementia—no mention; (4) bookshop foreclosure—only
    ''FOR LEASE'' and vague subsidy offer, not urgent foreclosure; (5) 2-week deadline—story
    spans ''festival week'' without clear urgency. BEAT EXECUTION: Adequate but incomplete.
    The story executes a solid romance arc with reunion, rising tension, and climactic
    moment, but lacks the emotional weight of the hidden constraints. The stakes feel
    romantic rather than existential (family crisis, business survival, unresolved
    past). NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong. The prose is lyrical, pacing is well-controlled,
    character voice is authentic, and the lantern scene is genuinely moving. However,
    this quality masks the absence of deeper thematic constraints that would elevate
    it from pleasant romance to complex emotional drama.'
