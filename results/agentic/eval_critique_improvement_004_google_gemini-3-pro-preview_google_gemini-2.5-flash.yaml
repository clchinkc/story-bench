  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on character interiority, specifically
    how Teddy's inner life was conveyed. Version 0 had a good start with the bunion
    detail, but subsequent revisions (V1, V2, V3) progressively deepened the portrayal
    of Martha's absence and Teddy's internal struggle. V1 introduced the 'silence
    waking up with him,' V2 added the 'heavy silence' in the armchair, and V3 solidified
    this with the 'Reader's Digest barricade' and 'localized draft.' This shows a
    clear and effective response to the feedback, moving from more surface-level physical
    details to richer, more emotional interiority. The final version successfully
    integrates these improvements while maintaining the strong opening and other narrative
    elements.
