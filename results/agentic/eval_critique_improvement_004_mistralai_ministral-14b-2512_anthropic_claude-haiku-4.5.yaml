  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.72): The revision addresses the core critique
    about interiority by replacing some tell-based reflection (''He thought of...'')
    with physical manifestations (trembling hands, rattling cup, clenched throat).
    However, the final output still contains multiple instances of ''He thought of...''
    (appears 5+ times), suggesting incomplete responsiveness to the critique about
    over-reliance on internal exposition. The author claims to have ''removed direct
    reflections'' but this is only partially true. Positive: The addition of dialogue
    with Lila and the sensory details (tea, petunias, jar of kaya) do show improvement
    in conveying emotion through action.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.68): Across versions, there is modest improvement. Version
    0→1 adds specificity to the coffee shop and barista. Version 1→2 shows minor refinement.
    Version 3 (final) attempts to address interiority concerns but incompletely. The
    trajectory is upward but plateaus—the story doesn''t demonstrate the kind of transformative
    revision that would suggest deep engagement with critique. The core structural
    issues remain.


    PRESERVATION (0.75): Strong sensory details are maintained (hydrangeas, crack
    in sidewalk, cap smell, petunias). The opening remains elegant. Marjorie''s presence
    through absence is preserved. However, some revision attempts introduce new issues:
    the repetitive ''He thought of...'' structure actually worsens interiority rather
    than improving it.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.78 / 4 of 5):

    1. ✓ SPECIFIC LOVING DETAIL OF ROUTINE: Strong. The crack in sidewalk, Tigers
    cap, coffee shop ritual, hydrant memory are specific and textured.

    2. ✓ DISRUPTION REVEALS AVOIDANCE: Adequate. The construction detour forces Teddy
    to confront his avoidance of Lila''s porch. However, the ''something avoided''
    feels somewhat thin—it''s avoidance of a neighbor, not a deeper psychological
    truth.

    3. ✓ NEIGHBOR WHOSE STORY INTERSECTS: Present. Lila Chen appears and shares her
    story (daughter in Singapore, cities changing). The intersection is present but
    underdeveloped—we learn about her but don''t see how her story specifically mirrors
    or illuminates Teddy''s.

    4. ✓ LATE WIFE PRESENT THROUGH ABSENCE: Strong. Marjorie appears through the cap,
    memories, dialogue echoes, the puppy story.

    5. ✗ NEW PATH OFFERS SOMETHING OLD PATH COULDN''T: Weak. The new path (turning
    left toward Lila) is presented as emotionally significant, but the story doesn''t
    clearly articulate what this path offers that the old one didn''t. Is it connection?
    Storytelling? The ending suggests repetition (''The next morning, he''d do it
    again'') rather than transformation. The final line about ''stories he''d been
    avoiding'' is tell, not show.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.70): Story Circle beats are present but unevenly executed:

    - YOU: ✓ Established (routine, cap, crack in sidewalk)

    - NEED: ✓ Implied (connection, meaning)

    - GO: ✓ Forced detour

    - SEARCH: ✓ Avoidance of Lila, internal conflict

    - FIND: ✓ Conversation with Lila, tea, jar of kaya

    - TAKE: Weak. The ''taking'' is ambiguous—does he take the jar? The new path?
    The lesson? The ending suggests he''ll repeat the new path, but this feels more
    like acceptance than transformation.

    - RETURN: Incomplete. He returns to the construction site but the return doesn''t
    feel earned or revelatory.

    - CHANGE: Unclear. What has fundamentally changed? He''s taking a different route,
    but the story doesn''t demonstrate internal transformation.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.74): Prose is generally strong with good sensory detail and
    pacing. However:

    - Repetitive structure (''He thought of...'') undermines sophistication

    - The ending feels rushed and somewhat sentimental (''sweet like memories'')

    - Dialogue with Lila is functional but not particularly revealing

    - The final paragraph contradicts the earlier claim about removing tell-based
    reflection

    - Tonal consistency is good but emotional stakes could be higher


    OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The revision demonstrates awareness of critique but incomplete
    execution. The author correctly identified the problem (over-reliance on internal
    exposition) but didn''t fully solve it. The story is competent and touching but
    doesn''t achieve the subtlety and depth the constraints demand. The new path constraint
    remains the weakest element—the story shows Teddy taking a different route but
    doesn''t convincingly demonstrate what this route offers that justifies the emotional
    weight of the narrative.'
