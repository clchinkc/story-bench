  evidence: 'Version 0/1 were fragments establishing duty and the hidden brochure.
    Version 2 introduced concrete cultural details (masa harina, avocados, Tío’s shop,
    abuella’s bills) that began to show texture and stakes. Version 3 tightened phrasing
    and kept those details. The final draft expands into a complete arc: Mateo’s interior
    life is dramatized through actions (scribbling on receipts, inventing stories
    while working), Ms. Garcia’s intervention reframes his fear, and Abuela’s kitchen
    scene crystallizes the choice with a concrete image (cascarones on the shelf and
    her hand covering his). The father’s final line and Mateo’s concrete plan (mapped
    bus, extra Saturdays) make the resolution earned. Remaining weakness: the line
    “The conflict was a constant, low hum” tells rather than fully showing the interior
    conflict, so while the piece largely responds to feedback, one constraint is only
    partially met.'
