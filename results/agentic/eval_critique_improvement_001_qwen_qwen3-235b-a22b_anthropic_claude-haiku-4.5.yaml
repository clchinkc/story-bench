  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The revision demonstrates strong engagement
    with feedback. The addition of Eddie''s physical tell (''scrape of rusted netting
    on his boots'') directly addresses the need to show rather than tell his secret.
    The tin motif recurs with intentional restraint (''lingers on it before closing
    it again''), showing responsiveness to emotional stakes feedback. However, the
    response to Critique 2''s missing-text concern is implicit rather than explicit—the
    author provided the story but didn''t acknowledge the gap. Score: 0.85 (strong
    execution with minor communication clarity issues).


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Versions 1-3 appear identical in the submission, limiting
    visible progression analysis. However, comparing VERSION 0 (partial) to FINAL
    OUTPUT shows meaningful enhancement: (1) Fog transitions from static atmosphere
    (''pressed against windowpanes'') to active narrative agent (''parted just enough
    to reveal''); (2) Sarah''s methodical nature gains specificity (''charcoal strokes
    sharp despite condensation''); (3) The ending shifts from ambiguous to tensioned
    (''seabird cried like a breaking voice''). The trajectory is positive but constrained
    by limited revision visibility. Score: 0.80 (clear improvement but incomplete
    documentation).


    PRESERVATION: Core strengths maintained excellently: Sarah''s coffee-mug precision
    opening remains; the serpent tattoo callback is preserved and deepened; Porter''s
    characterization stays consistent; the 700-word constraint is honored. The tin
    becomes more sophisticated (recurring motif rather than one-off detail). Weaknesses
    addressed without sacrificing voice: Eddie''s lie gains physical evidence without
    losing his menace; the fog gains purpose without losing atmospheric texture. Score:
    0.88 (strong balance).


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5): (1) Methodical nature through action: ✓ ''aligned
    coffee mug precisely parallel,'' ''packed kit with practiced precision,'' ''charcoal
    strokes sharp,'' ''organizing notes into precise stacks''—all behavioral, not
    expository. (2) Fog serves narrative purpose: ✓ Delays ME arrival, obscures lighthouse,
    ''parted just enough to reveal,'' creates tension in final scene—functional, not
    decorative. (3) Local character secret: ✓ Eddie''s lie about net retrieval, physical
    evidence (rusted netting scrape), his evasion about the lighthouse. (4) Past case
    hinted before revealed: ✓ ''tin she only opened when nightmares pressed,'' ''Subject
    3: Missing informant,'' then full reveal of Operation Hollow Net connection. (5)
    Ends on decision, not resolution: ✓ ''Her hand gripped the cold iron rail'' with
    shadow figure inside—choice suspended, not concluded. Score: 0.90 (all constraints
    met; minor: the past case reveal could be more subtle earlier).


    BEAT EXECUTION (3 required beats): (1) Investigation beat (Act I-II): ✓ Body discovery,
    evidence collection, Eddie confrontation—methodical progression. (2) Revelation
    beat (Act II-III): ✓ Tattoo recognition, logbook discovery, lighthouse coordinates—past
    case surfaces. (3) Decision beat (Act III): ✓ Midnight approach, shadow figure,
    hand on rail—choice crystallized. Score: 0.85 (beats clear but Act II could deepen
    the emotional weight of tattoo recognition).


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is precise and atmospheric. Strengths: sensory specificity
    (''wet gauze,'' ''trapped bird,'' ''breaking voice''), efficient characterization
    (Porter''s drooping mustache), structural clarity. Weaknesses: the logbook theft
    feels slightly rushed (''retrieved from the sheriff''s locked cabinet''—one line
    for a rule-breaking moment); Eddie''s dialogue (''You city cops think you know
    fog'') borders on exposition; the final shadow figure is deliberately ambiguous
    but could gain one more concrete detail for grounding. The 700-word constraint
    creates some compression in emotional beats. Score: 0.82 (strong execution with
    minor pacing/depth trade-offs due to length).


    OVERALL ASSESSMENT: This revision demonstrates solid craft and responsive iteration.
    The story satisfies all hard constraints and executes required beats. The main
    limitation is incomplete revision documentation (versions 1-3 appear identical),
    which obscures the improvement trajectory. The final output is publishable-quality
    flash fiction with clear voice, functional atmosphere, and genuine narrative tension.
    The decision to end on Sarah''s choice rather than resolution is particularly
    effective.'
