  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive, well-structured across three acts with
    specific day-by-day timeline. Output demonstrates strong adherence to plan with
    vivid sensory details (kimchi jjigae steam, gochujang tang, galbi smoke). All
    three required beats present: Setup (demolition notice, photo of Ji-yeon), Confrontation
    (Day 5 kitchen argument about hiding from grief), Resolution (farewell dinner,
    jesa ritual, departure with Anna). David''s grief is effectively conveyed implicitly
    through actions (touching photo frame, cooking Ji-yeon''s favorite galbi, admission
    ''It''s all I have left'') without explicit statement. Daughter''s estrangement
    has specific cause: Anna resented David''s neglect during Ji-yeon''s illness and
    after her death, missing milestones. Regular customer Mr. Lee serves as mirror
    of loss and wisdom. Korean cultural element beyond food: jesa ritual (ancestor
    veneration with altar, rice, fruit offering) is authentic and meaningful. Food
    used symbolically twice: kimchi jjigae as opening/closing anchor of 25 years;
    galbi as bridge between David and Anna, invoking Ji-yeon''s memory; mandu dumplings
    as metaphor for sealed family bonds. Ending is hopeful but bittersweet—restaurant
    lost, but relationship with Anna restored, new beginning in California with pop-up
    dinners as compromise. WEAKNESSES: One constraint partially underexecuted—the
    ''hopeful but not unrealistically happy'' ending borders on slightly too neat
    (pop-up dinners feel like a quick resolution). The food symbolism, while present,
    could be more integrated throughout rather than concentrated in specific scenes.
    Mr. Lee''s role, though present, is somewhat peripheral to the main conflict resolution.
    Pacing in middle section (Days 3-5) compresses multiple confrontations, risking
    emotional whiplash. TECHNICAL: Plan demonstrates clear understanding of three-act
    structure and constraint mapping. Output shows strong narrative voice and cultural
    authenticity. Dialogue feels natural. Sensory details ground the story effectively.'
