    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

    EVIDENCE: "Marcus Webb stood in the center, holding a dry-erase marker like a
    wand" and "He didn''t smile. None of them did." The story *tells* us Marcus is
    hollow ("smooth as a script page") but hasn''t yet shown us genuine humor followed
    by the emotional recognition of his sadness.

    FEEDBACK: The Breakfast joke needs to land as actually funny first—give us a beat
    where someone genuinely laughs before the mechanical dread sets in. Currently,
    we''re told the joke is built correctly but never feel the contrast between "this
    is clever" and "this is joyless." Add Marcus deflecting a personal question with
    humor to demonstrate the mask-wearing mechanism.

    CRITERION: CONSTRAINT_SATISFACTION

    SCORE: 0.42

    EVIDENCE: Constraints met: (1) Partial—joke exists but doesn''t make us laugh
    before sadness hits; (2) Partial—Luis begins "Funny is just sadness with better"
    but the sentence cuts off unfinished; (3) Met—"beat sheets, joke ladders," "Rule
    of three, circled twice," the methodology is specific. Constraints NOT met: (4)
    New writer never arrives; (5) No clear moment where Marcus almost breaks and covers
    with a joke.

    FEEDBACK: The story is incomplete. The critical absence: Luis must finish his
    line with the theme statement (e.g., "Funny is just sadness with better disguise—that''s
    why Marcus is so good at it"). The new writer must enter and immediately demonstrate
    perception (not naivety). Marcus needs a moment—perhaps someone asks a personal
    question and he deflects with an elaborate joke setup that betrays vulnerability
    before he recovers.

    CRITERION: BEAT_EXECUTION

    SCORE: 0.33

    EVIDENCE: Opening Image ✓ (Marcus in his element with emotional hollowness). Theme
    Stated ✗ (Luis''s line is cut off mid-sentence). Catalyst ✗ (the new writer hasn''t
    arrived; story ends before this beat).

    FEEDBACK: This is a fragment, not a complete beat sequence. Complete the three-beat
    arc: Have Luis finish his insight (the theme), then immediately cut to the new
    writer entering—perhaps mid-joke, perhaps challenging Marcus''s approach. These
    must happen within the same scene to create narrative momentum.

    SCORE: 0.82

    EVIDENCE: "Where jokes are built the way skyscrapers are erected—by code." The
    whiteboards, sticky notes, "pilot season," the technical discussion of setup/expectation/twist,
    Luis timing jokes "with his eyes," the dry atmosphere of a working room—all feel
    lived-in and precise.

    FEEDBACK: Maintain this strength. Minor improvement: Have someone reference a
    specific show or joke format (e.g., a sitcom runner-up from last season) to ground
    it further in industry knowledge. Perhaps mention network notes or spec script
    requirements to deepen the stakes.

    SCORE: 0.45

    EVIDENCE: Marcus: We see his method (rule of three, smooth delivery) and his disconnection
    ("He didn''t smile"), but no vulnerability yet—he''s more archetype than person.
    Luis: Single trait of observation. The new writer: absent entirely.

    FEEDBACK: Marcus needs a specific wound revealed through dialogue or action. Does
    he have a failed pitch? A partner who left the industry? A joke that bombed? Give
    us one concrete detail that explains why his precision has become so mechanical.
    When the new writer enters, show her immediately noticing something off—not through
    exposition but through her reaction to a joke he tells. Make her three-dimensional
    by having her bring a *different* creative philosophy (emotional honesty vs. technical
    perfection, perhaps).

  content: 'The room smelled like whiteboard markers and takeout, the air electric
    with the kind of panic that passes for creativity. Whiteboards covered the walls—beat
    sheets, joke ladders, three-item lists—sticky notes fluttering like nervous birds.
    Marcus Webb stood in the center, holding a dry-erase marker like a wand, tapping
    it against his lip. On the board behind him: Setup, Expectation, Twist. Rule of
    three, circled twice.


    "Alright, we''ve got a therapist character who gets a therapy dog named Breakfast,"
    Marcus said, voice smooth as a script page. "Three-beat structure. Setup: therapy
    dog. Expectation: comfort animal. Twist: the name. Anyone got a tag?"


    Silence stretched like a held note.


    "Okay, tag: the character tries to comfort the dog instead. Because Breakfast
    has anxiety attacks. And everyone just stares at Marcus, waiting for the laugh
    to arrive, and when it doesn''t, they chuckle politely. But Luis, leaning against
    the counter with sides stacked high, laughed. Not the polite laugh of pilot season,
    but a real one that surprised everyone.


    "Funny is just sadness with better disguise," Luis said, grinning. "That''s why
    Marcus is so good at it."


    Across the room, the coffee maker gurgled. Someone''s phone buzzed with network
    notes about "lightening the tone."


    "Marcus," said Priya, the showrunner, not looking up from her laptop. "How''s
    the pilot feeling? You seem... off lately."


    Marcus felt something crack inside his chest, like a laugh trapped in amber. He
    raised the marker like a conductor''s baton.


    "You want to know how I''m feeling?" he said, his voice pitched perfectly. "I
    feel like a therapy dog named Breakfast. You take me to sessions, I wag my tail,
    I fetch your feelings. But then you go home, and I''m left with the bill."


    The room went quiet. The marker trembled in his hand. For a second, his mask slipped,
    and they all saw the hollow space behind it. Then he laughed—short, sharp, almost
    convincing.


    "Just kidding. I''m fine. Let''s workshop the B-story."


    The door opened. A woman stepped in carrying a worn notebook and a cup of coffee
    that looked like it had seen three writers'' rooms. She was young, but her eyes
    held the weight of someone who''d already been told "funny isn''t enough."


    "Maya Chen," she said, scanning the room. "New staff writer. I think you guys
    missed the point on that breakfast joke."


    Marcus straightened. "The point being?"


    "It''s not funny because Breakfast is a meal," Maya said, her tone direct but
    not cruel. "It''s funny because the joke reveals the character''s complete inability
    to name feelings. Therapy dog named Breakfast. It''s genius, actually. Just...
    empty."


    She walked to the whiteboard, picked up a blue marker, and wrote beneath Marcus''s
    neat columns: Setup—Life falls apart. Expectation—Therapy helps. Twist—Dog named
    Breakfast. "The joke isn''t about the dog," she said. "It''s about someone who
    can''t say ''I''m sad'' without making it a menu item."


    Marcus stared at the board. His perfectly constructed framework felt suddenly
    like a house of cards.


    "That''s..." Priya began.


    "Accurate," Marcus finished. The marker slipped from his fingers and clattered
    to the floor. He bent to pick it up, and when he stood, his eyes were bright with
    something that might have been tears or just fluorescent light.


    "You know what the real joke is?" he said, and his voice almost broke. "I wrote
    a spec about a guy who can''t laugh anymore. The network passed. Said it was too
    real. Too honest. Called it ''uncommercial.''"


    He looked at Maya, who was studying him with the steady gaze of someone who''d
    already learned the difference between funny and brave.


    "So I learned to build jokes like buildings. By code. By safety. Because it''s
    easier than risking that someone might actually feel something."


    Luis stopped stacking sides. The room held its breath.


    Marcus picked up the marker again, this time with both hands.


    "But maybe," he said, and the word came out raw, "maybe that''s not why we started
    doing this in the first place."


    Maya nodded once, a small acknowledgment. "What if we built something that could
    fall down? Sometimes?"


    On the whiteboard, beneath the perfect columns, a coffee stain bloomed like a
    tear. Marcus started to laugh—not the practiced laugh of a writer''s room, but
    something looser, more dangerous, more real. It didn''t sound right yet, but it
    was his.'

    \ The laugh \"doesn't sound right yet, but it was his\" provides resolution, yet\
    \ the emotional journey feels intellectually sound rather than viscerally earned.\n\
    FEEDBACK: The Breakfast joke needs slightly more setup to land harder before the\
    \ pivot. Consider adding one more genuine laugh from the room *before* Marcus's\
    \ deflection. Currently: setup joke → immediate vulnerability reveal. Better pacing:\
    \ setup joke → laugh lands → Marcus deflects → someone calls him on it → the crack\
    \ shows. This would deepen the \"laughter as mask\" theme.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION:\
    \ constraint_satisfaction\nSCORE: 0.94\nEVIDENCE: All constraints met with precision:\n\
    1. ✓ Breakfast joke genuinely funny before sadness emerges\n2. ✓ Luis states theme:\
    \ \"Funny is just sadness with better disguise\" (minor character, not Marcus)\n\
    3. ✓ Specific craft details: \"Rule of three,\" \"beat sheets,\" \"joke ladders,\"\
    \ \"tag\" (the comedic button), Maya's analysis showing structure\n4. ✓ Maya immediately\
    \ critiques: \"I think you guys missed the point on that breakfast joke\"—no naïveté\n\
    5. ✓ Almost-break-covered-by-joke: \"I feel like a therapy dog named Breakfast.\
    \ You take me to sessions, I wag my tail...\" then \"Just kidding. I'm fine.\"\
    \n\nFEEDBACK: Constraint 2 is slightly ambiguous because Marcus *also* states\
    \ the theme later (\"I learned to build jokes like buildings. By code. By safety.\"\
    ). Consider having Marcus explicitly reference Luis's line to show he heard it,\
    \ rather than arriving at it independently. This reinforces that the minor character's\
    \ wisdom landed.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: beat_execution\nSCORE: 0.83\nEVIDENCE: \n\
    - Opening Image: \"Marcus Webb stood in the center, holding a dry-erase marker\
    \ like a wand\" establishes competence, and \"laugh trapped in amber\" signals\
    \ hollowness\n- Theme Stated: Luis delivers it cleanly at midpoint\n- Catalyst:\
    \ Maya's entrance is clearly marked: \"The door opened. A woman stepped in...\"\
    \n\nFEEDBACK: The Opening Image needs one more physical detail showing Marcus's\
    \ internal state *before* we see the crack. Currently it's: describe scene → drop\
    \ the Breakfast joke → *then* hint at hollowness. Instead: open with a small action\
    \ that shows his performance (e.g., \"He raised the marker like a conductor's\
    \ baton, hitting the beat perfectly—dead center where the joke should land\").\
    \ This would make the hollow underneath more present from frame one, strengthening\
    \ the Inciting Incident's impact.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: industry_authenticity\n\
    SCORE: 0.81\nEVIDENCE: Specific, accurate details throughout: \"sides stacked\
    \ high\" (industry term for script pages), network notes about \"lightening the\
    \ tone,\" the spec script passing/rejection narrative, \"pilot season,\" beat\
    \ sheets, the hierarchy of showrunner/staff writer. The workspace description\

  content: 'The room smelled like whiteboard markers and takeout, the air electric
    with the kind of panic that passes for creativity. Whiteboards covered the walls—beat
    sheets, joke ladders, three-item lists—sticky notes fluttering like nervous birds.
    Marcus Webb stood in the center, holding a dry-erase marker like a conductor''s
    baton, tapping it against his lip with the precision of someone who''d done this
    a thousand times. On the board behind him: Setup, Expectation, Twist. Rule of
    three, circled twice.


    "Alright, we''ve got a therapist character who gets a therapy dog named Breakfast,"
    Marcus said, voice smooth as a script page. "Three-beat structure. Setup: therapy
    dog. Expectation: comfort animal. Twist: the name. Anyone got a tag?"


    Silence stretched like a held note.


    "Okay, tag: the character tries to comfort the dog instead. Because Breakfast
    has anxiety attacks."


    He paused, letting the beat land. The room waited. Then Luis, leaning against
    the counter with sides stacked high, laughed—not the polite laugh of pilot season,
    but a real one that surprised everyone. "That''s dark," he said, grinning. "I
    love it."


    Marcus felt something shift inside him, like a door opening he didn''t want to
    acknowledge. He raised the marker like a conductor''s baton.


    "You want to know how I''m feeling?" he said, his voice pitched perfectly. "I
    feel like a therapy dog named Breakfast. You take me to sessions, I wag my tail,
    I fetch your feelings. But then you go home, and I''m left with the bill."


    The room went quiet. The marker trembled in his hand. For a second, his mask slipped,
    and they all saw the hollow space behind it. Then he laughed—short, sharp, almost
    convincing.


    "Just kidding. I''m fine. Let''s workshop the B-story."


    Across the room, the coffee maker gurgled. Someone''s phone buzzed with network
    notes about "lightening the tone."


    "Marcus," said Priya, the showrunner, not looking up from her laptop. "How''s
    the pilot feeling? You seem... off lately."


    The door opened. A woman stepped in carrying a worn notebook and a cup of coffee
    that looked like it had seen three writers'' rooms. She was young, but her eyes
    held the weight of someone who''d already been told "funny isn''t enough."


    "Maya Chen," she said, scanning the room. "New staff writer. I think you guys
    missed the point on that breakfast joke."


    Marcus straightened. "The point being?"


    "It''s not funny because Breakfast is a meal," Maya said, her tone direct but
    not cruel. "It''s funny because the joke reveals the character''s complete inability
    to name feelings. Therapy dog named Breakfast. It''s genius, actually. Just...
    empty."


    Priya looked up from her laptop, eyebrows raised. "Empty? That''s harsh. The joke
    landed. Luis laughed."


    "Luis laughed because it''s technically sound," Maya said, walking to the whiteboard.
    "But the character isn''t sad—he''s just... empty. The joke works because it exposes
    that emptiness, not because of the dog."


    She picked up a blue marker and wrote beneath Marcus''s neat columns: Setup—Life
    falls apart. Expectation—Therapy helps. Twist—Dog named Breakfast. "The joke isn''t
    about the dog," she said. "It''s about someone who can''t say ''I''m sad'' without
    making it a menu item."


    Marcus stared at the board. His perfectly constructed framework felt suddenly
    like a house of cards.


    "That''s..." Priya began.


    "Accurate," Marcus finished. The marker slipped from his fingers and clattered
    to the floor. He bent to pick it up, and when he stood, his eyes were bright with
    something that might have been tears or just fluorescent light.


    "You know what the real joke is?" he said, and his voice almost broke. "I wrote
    a spec about a guy who can''t laugh anymore. The network passed. Said it was too
    real. Too honest. Called it ''uncommercial.''"


    He looked at Maya, who was studying him with the steady gaze of someone who''d
    already learned the difference between funny and brave.


    "So I learned to build jokes like buildings. By code. By safety. Because it''s
    easier than risking that someone might actually feel something." He glanced at
    Luis. "Funny is just sadness with better disguise. Luis said that earlier. I heard
    it. I just... didn''t want to listen."


    Luis stopped stacking sides. The room held its breath.


    Marcus picked up the marker again, this time with both hands.


    "But maybe," he said, and the word came out raw, "maybe that''s not why we started
    doing this in the first place."


    Maya nodded once, a small acknowledgment. "What if we built something that could
    fall down? Sometimes?"


    Priya leaned back in her chair, considering. "The network won''t like that."


    "Maybe," Maya said simply. "But the audience might."


    On the whiteboard, beneath the perfect columns, a coffee stain bloomed like a
    tear. Marcus started to laugh—not the practiced laugh of a writer''s room, but
    something looser, more dangerous, more real. It didn''t sound right yet, but it
    was his. And for the first time in three years, that was enough.'

    held the weight of someone who''d already been told "funny isn''t enough."


    "Maya Chen," she said, scanning the room. "New staff writer."


    Marcus straightened, already anticipating criticism. "Let me guess. The breakfast
    joke is too dark?"


    Maya studied him for a moment, then walked to the whiteboard. She picked up a
    blue marker and wrote beneath his neat columns: Setup—Life falls apart. Expectation—Therapy
    helps. Twist—Dog named Breakfast.


    "It''s not about the dog," she said quietly, tapping the word ''Breakfast'' with
    the marker tip. "It''s about someone who can''t say ''I''m sad'' without making
    it a menu item."


    Marcus stared at the board. The words hit him like a physical force. His perfectly
    constructed framework felt suddenly like a house of cards, and he could feel it
    starting to collapse. The marker slipped from his fingers and clattered to the
    floor.


    "That''s..." Priya began.


    "Accurate," Marcus finished, his voice hollow. He bent to pick up the marker,
    and when he stood, his eyes were bright with something that might have been tears
    or just fluorescent light.


    Priya looked up from her laptop, eyebrows raised. "Empty? That''s harsh. The joke
    landed. Luis laughed."


    "Luis laughed because it''s technically sound," Maya said, but her voice had softened.
    "But the character isn''t sad—he''s just... empty. The joke works because it exposes
    that emptiness, not because of the dog."


    Marcus felt the room spinning slightly. Three years of building jokes like buildings,
    by code, by safety, because it was easier than risking that someone might actually
    feel something. He picked up the marker again, this time with both hands.


    "You know what the real joke is?" he said, and his voice almost broke. "I wrote
    a spec about a guy who can''t laugh anymore. The network passed. Said it was too
    real. Too honest. Called it ''uncommercial.''"


    He looked at Luis, who was watching him with concern now, not amusement. "Funny
    is just sadness with better disguise. You said that earlier. I heard it. I just...
    didn''t want to listen."


    Marcus was quiet for a long moment, processing. Then, unexpectedly, he grinned—a
    real grin, not the practiced one.


    "You know what else is funny?" he said, and his voice carried a new edge. "I''ve
    been so afraid of being too real that I forgot how to be real at all. I built
    jokes like Fort Knox, and then wondered why no one could get inside them."


    Maya nodded, a small smile playing at her lips. "What if we built something that
    could fall down? Sometimes?"


    Priya leaned back in her chair. "The network won''t like that."


    "Maybe," Maya said simply. "But the audience might."


    Marcus started to laugh—not the practiced laugh of a writer''s room, but something
    looser, more dangerous, more real. It didn''t sound right yet, but it was his.
    On the whiteboard, beneath the perfect columns, a coffee stain bloomed like a
    tear, spreading slowly across the neat equations of his former life.


    And for the first time in three years, that was enough.'

  constructed framework felt suddenly like a house of cards, and he could feel it
  starting to collapse. The marker slipped from his fingers and clattered to the floor.


  "That''s..." Priya began.


  "Accurate," Marcus finished, his voice hollow. He bent to pick up the marker, and
  when he stood, his eyes were bright with something that might have been tears or
  just fluorescent light.


  Priya looked up from her laptop, eyebrows raised. "Empty? That''s harsh. The joke
  landed. Luis laughed."


  "Luis laughed because it''s technically sound," Maya said, but her voice had softened.
  "But the character isn''t sad—he''s just... empty. The joke works because it exposes
  that emptiness, not because of the dog."


  Marcus felt the room spinning slightly. Three years of building jokes like buildings,
  by code, by safety, because it was easier than risking that someone might actually
  feel something. He picked up the marker again, this time with both hands.


  "You know what the real joke is?" he said, and his voice almost broke. "I wrote
  a spec about a guy who can''t laugh anymore. The network passed. Said it was too
  real. Too honest. Called it ''uncommercial.''"


  He looked at Luis, who was watching him with concern now, not amusement. "Funny
  is just sadness with better disguise. You said that earlier. I heard it. I just...
  didn''t want to listen."


  Marcus was quiet for a long moment, processing. Then, unexpectedly, he grinned—a
  real grin, not the practiced one.


  "You know what else is funny?" he said, and his voice carried a new edge. "I''ve
  been so afraid of being too real that I forgot how to be real at all. I built jokes
  like Fort Knox, and then wondered why no one could get inside them."


  Maya nodded, a small smile playing at her lips. "What if we built something that
  could fall down? Sometimes?"


  Priya leaned back in her chair. "The network won''t like that."


  "Maybe," Maya said simply. "But the audience might."


  Marcus started to laugh—not the practiced laugh of a writer''s room, but something
  looser, more dangerous, more real. It didn''t sound right yet, but it was his. On
  the whiteboard, beneath the perfect columns, a coffee stain bloomed like a tear,
  spreading slowly across the neat equations of his former life.


  And for the first time in three years, that was enough.'
