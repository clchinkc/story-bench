  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer demonstrated moderate responsiveness
    to feedback. Critiques 1-3 consistently praised visceral interiority (trapped
    bird heart, shoulder blade itch, refrigerator B-flat) and these elements were
    preserved and deepened in the final output. However, Critique 1 noted ''surface-level''
    reactions to Maya after initial moments—the final version addresses this partially
    through Teddy''s internal conflict (wanting to turn away, the copper taste of
    his words, the structural integrity check) but could have developed Maya''s perspective
    more reciprocally. The revisions show the writer leaning into sensory specificity
    rather than expanding emotional complexity with the neighbor character.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Modest but genuine improvement. The three revision versions
    appear nearly identical in the provided text (all begin identically), suggesting
    either truncation in the prompt or minimal surface-level changes between them.
    The final output, however, shows clear refinement: the Martha absence is woven
    more subtly (the hop, the cinnamon/vinegar memory, the kitchen box), and Teddy''s
    avoidance is explicitly named (''the silence of the house waited for him there'').
    The ending pivot—planting his heel squarely, feeling real pain—represents a stronger
    narrative arc than likely present in earlier versions, though we cannot verify
    this from the truncated revision data.


    PRESERVATION: Strong. All praised elements remain: the B-flat refrigerator hum,
    the trapped bird heart, the shoulder blade itch, the specific shoe-tying ritual,
    the porch''s C-sharp groan. These weren''t sacrificed for new material; they anchor
    the piece.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5):

    1. **Teddy''s routine with loving detail**: ✓ Exceptional. Shoe-tying tension,
    porch groan pitch, the hop over concrete, 5:42 AM precision, knowledge of neighborhood
    schedules, the metronome metaphor—all specific and tender.

    2. **Disruption reveals avoidance**: ✓ Strong. The sewer repair forces Teddy off
    his loop; Maya''s presence triggers the shoulder-blade itch and his own admission
    that he ''wanted the safety of his empty kitchen where nothing unexpected ever
    happened.'' The disruption exposes his grief-driven isolation.

    3. **Neighbor whose story intersects**: ✓ Adequate-to-good. Maya is present and
    her ''fresh start'' contrasts with Teddy''s stasis, but her interiority remains
    thin. We learn she''s moving, things are breaking, she wants light—but her story
    doesn''t deeply intersect Teddy''s beyond the box-taping moment. This is the weakest
    constraint execution.

    4. **Late wife present through absence**: ✓ Excellent. Martha appears through:
    the hop ritual, the cinnamon/vinegar memory, the kitchen-as-heart philosophy,
    the ''echo of her laughter,'' the five-year timeline, the dark cozy rooms contrast.
    Her absence is palpable.

    5. **New path offers what old couldn''t**: ✓ Strong. The detour forces Teddy toward
    connection (Maya), toward pain (the real jolt up his spine), toward the unburdened
    nod from the stranger—things his closed loop prevented. The final image of planting
    his heel squarely suggests acceptance of discomfort as aliveness.


    BEAT EXECUTION: The Story Circle structure is present but not perfectly articulated:

    - **You**: Teddy''s routine established ✓

    - **Need**: Disruption (sewer repair) ✓

    - **Go**: Detour taken ✓

    - **Search**: Encounter with Maya, internal struggle ✓

    - **Find**: The box, the moment of connection ✓

    - **Take**: Helping Maya, entering the bright house ✓

    - **Return**: Walking back out, choosing the new path ✓

    - **Changed**: The heel-planting, the real jolt—Teddy has shifted from avoidance
    to engagement ✓


    The beats are present but the emotional stakes could be higher at the ''Find''
    moment. The box-taping feels slightly underweighted for a turning point.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: 0.88. Prose is strong: sensory, specific, emotionally resonant.
    The metaphors (metronome, trapped bird, ghost haunting) work. The dialogue feels
    natural. The ending image is powerful. Weaknesses: Maya remains somewhat instrumental
    (a catalyst rather than a full character); the middle section (detour navigation)
    could be tighter; the transition from ''You''re blocking the view'' to the box-taping
    could be smoother. The piece risks sentimentality but mostly avoids it through
    specificity and Teddy''s gruff voice.


    OVERALL: A solid, publishable story that successfully executes most constraints
    and demonstrates responsive revision. The main gap is neighbor interiority and
    the depth of their intersection.'
