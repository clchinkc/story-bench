  evidence: 'The revision trajectory demonstrates strong responsiveness to critique
    feedback. Critique 1 (0.68 on interiority) identified emotional abstraction; Critique
    2 (0.75) praised specific sensory detail; Critique 3 (0.85) validated the direction.
    The final output preserves the strongest elements—the precise sensory memories
    (''Her humming while she rolled pie dough. The particular silence of the house
    after'')—while deepening interiority through action and dialogue rather than exposition.
    The character''s internal conflict is now conveyed through physical hesitation
    (''His right foot lifted, ready to step forward'') and the concrete choice at
    the end, showing growth through behavior rather than telling. All five constraints
    are satisfied: (1) Teddy''s routine is shown with loving specificity (the oak
    at 6:47, Mrs. Chen''s light at 6:52, the buckled sidewalk); (2) disruption reveals
    avoidance of grief and connection; (3) Marcus''s intersecting story (loss of father,
    parallel ritual-walking) mirrors and illuminates Teddy''s journey; (4) Diane''s
    absence permeates through memory, the pie he never baked, the step he couldn''t
    take; (5) the new path offers human connection and shared vulnerability that the
    old route''s solitary ritual couldn''t provide. Story Circle beats execute cleanly:
    YOU (routine established), NEED (disruption), GO (forced deviation), SEARCH (discovery
    of new rhythms and Marcus), FIND (the porch conversation revealing parallel grief),
    CHANGE (internal shift), RETURN (choice to take the new path). The prose quality
    improved through revisions—moving from exposition toward embodied emotion. The
    final image (watering tomatoes together) is earned and resonant, suggesting growth
    without sentimentality.'
