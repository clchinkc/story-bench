  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: 'You had hammered iron since dawn, when the rooks had begun to cry over
    Graymere and the mist had curled like old breath along the hedgerows. The forge
    had warmed your face and blistered your palms, and Master Oren had grunted the
    way he always did when the temper took: a short nod, a quiet approval. You knew
    the rhythm of bellows and anvil better than your own name. You knew the kingdom
    by the edges of its tools—ploughshares dulling from fallow fields no longer tilled,
    buckles blackened by soot the wind carried from the north. Folks had spoken of
    the darkness with mouths half shut, as though it might hear its name and draw
    nearer. Still, your world had been iron and fire and the square yard of light
    inside the forge.


    The Call came with hooves in the lane and a knock like thunder. A courier from
    the castle had stood with ash in his hair, his tabard scorched, his hands wrapped
    in linen. He had carried a bundle wrapped in sailcloth and laid it on your workbench.
    Inside, a sword had come apart into three broken lengths, its edge pitted and
    its fuller marred. But even ruined, it had gleamed with a pallid memory of daylight.


    “The Daystar,” the courier had whispered. “The only blade that ever parted the
    Night. The king’s smiths could not wake it. The darkness has reached the mountain
    passes. If this does not burn again, the river will freeze in its bed and the
    cattle will starve standing.”


    Master Oren had stared long at the shards. “Star-iron,” he had said in a voice
    that feared to be right. His eyes had lifted to you. “The old songs say such a
    blade remembers the hand that made it. I am too far from my own.” He had wrapped
    your fingers around the hammer’s worn haft. “You are still making your hand.”


    You had not wanted it. You had said you were only an apprentice, that you had
    never quenched steel in moonwater or listened for the quiet song iron made when
    it was ready. The courier’s mouth had gone thin; outside, the rooks had screamed
    again. When the door had creaked open, the hedge-witch from the marsh had ducked
    inside, her hair smelling of peat smoke. She had set a vial on the table, a bead
    of pale liquid that glowed faintly. “Drawn from the well that remembers the first
    dawn,” she had said. “It will take a brave heat. The Sunken Forge lies under the
    Brackenwood. A child of ash and sweat must go.”


    Fear had clung to you like soot. You had thought of your narrow bed and the bellows’
    sigh and the safe, small circle of light. But you had seen your master’s eyes,
    and in them a pride mingled with a pleading he would not voice. You had wrapped
    the broken blade in cloth, taken the vial, and tied your apron strings tight as
    oath.


    You had crossed the threshold at the boundary stone where the lane turned to bramble,
    stepping beyond the parish and into the Brackenwood’s old breath. The trees had
    leaned together to whisper, blotting the thin winter sun. The path had thinned
    to a deer track, then to nothing, and still you had walked, guided by the way
    the shards warmed in your pack. When dusk had fallen too fast, shadow things had
    watched with wet eyes from ferns, testing the air the way wolves tested fences.
    A lantern-maker’s widow had appeared from the underbrush with a lamp cupped inside
    her shawl. She had said nothing, only walked with you as far as the black door
    in the root of an oak. She had lifted the lamp and bowed as though you already
    wore a crown, and then she had gone, light dwindling.


    You had gone down. The stairs had been cut in ages you could not name, slick with
    a cold sweat that did not belong to stone. The Sunken Forge had opened like a
    mouth: an anvil bone-white with frost, a hearth that did not burn but breathed
    a slow, aching blue. The broken Daystar had keened softly in your hands, remembering
    itself.


    You had worked until your arms had trembled. Coal had not taken; frost-fire had.
    You had fed the hearth with your breath, with the last of the hedge-witch’s dawn-water,
    with the iron filings you carried like talismans. The darkness had come then,
    not in a shape but as a voice that had learned your name from cracks in the world.
    It had told you that you were too small, too thin at the edges, that iron bent
    the way people did—always away from pain. It had offered you sleep, an end to
    heat and hunger and failure.


    You had hammered while your fear spoke with its tongue.


    The Ordeal had come when the steel had softened enough to take the weld. The broken
    blade had wanted to stay broken. The frost-fire had flared, greedy as the dark.
    The Daystar’s memory had pushed back, and you had felt your own small days—the
    first spark you caught without help, the time you burned your hand and did not
    cry—rise like a second heat. You had thought of the rooks and the lane and Master
    Oren’s quiet nod. You had bared your forearm and let a single drop of your blood
    fall onto the waiting metal, not because the old songs demanded it, but because
    you wished to belong to what you made. The steel had sung then, a note so high
    that the darkness had flinched.


    When you had quenched the blade in the dawn-water, it had not screamed. It had
    sighed, as though a wind had moved through wheat after a long drought. You had
    lifted it, and the blue fire had leapt along its edge and licked the shadows from
    the rafters. The voice had fled, and in its place had been the echo of a thousand
    footsteps above, a kingdom waiting at the door.


    You had climbed until your legs had burned, and when you had stepped back into
    the Brackenwood, the trees had stood a little straighter. The rooks had wheeled
    and called, not in alarm but in astonishment. At the boundary stone you had turned
    and looked once toward the forge where your life had been small and safe, and
    then you had set your face toward the passes where the darkness pooled. The Daystar
    had hung at your side like a promise. You had not been a knight, not yet, but
    you had been the maker of a light, and that had been enough to begin.'
