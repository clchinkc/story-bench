  evidence: 'Across critique rounds the work shows clear, measurable improvement in
    interiority and emotional specificity: critic scores rose from ~0.65 to 0.75 to
    0.82. The final version preserves the original strengths (the lovingly detailed
    route, the mournful absence of Margaret) while adding or foregrounding interior
    signals—damp palm, loud heartbeat, the map-as-prayer—that make Teddy''s avoidance
    explicit and felt. The detour scene concretely reveals what he has been avoiding
    (the Pearl Street house and the fear of Margaret’s wants), and Eleanor’s brief
    backstory intersects organically. The new path gives Teddy what the old one could
    not: surprise, community, and a recovered sense of aliveness. While the three
    revision snapshots in the record look superficially similar, the critiques and
    the final text indicate incremental tightening of interior detail, subtler showing
    rather than telling, and consistent preservation of earlier vivid route details.'
