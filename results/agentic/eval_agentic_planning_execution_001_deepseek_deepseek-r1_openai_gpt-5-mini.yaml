  evidence: 'Plan: Explicitly mapped required beats and listed all six constraints,
    with concrete elements (knot signature, Elias, ''negative space'' profiling, 72-hour
    countdown). Final output: Strong opening image, Catalyst (knot/email), Debate
    (whether to involve FBI), and Break into Two (quitting job, partnering with Elias)
    are present; Marcus explicitly uses the unconventional ''negative space'' technique
    and confronts his past failure at his partner''s grave; a ticking clock is mentioned
    (72-hour countdown). Missing from the excerpt: an initial false lead Marcus pursues,
    the secondary-character betrayal (Anya is skeptical but not shown betraying him),
    and the Midpoint confrontation (not yet present). These absences reduce plan adherence
    and overall constraint satisfaction.'
