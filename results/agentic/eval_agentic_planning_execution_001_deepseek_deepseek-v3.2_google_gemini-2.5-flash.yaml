  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing all required
    elements and constraints. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan, executing
    all beats and constraints with strong narrative quality. All 6 constraints are
    met: false lead (Vance), unconventional profiling (Environmental Linguistics),
    ticking clock (48 hours, then 12 hours), betrayal (Rebecca Shaw), direct confrontation
    at midpoint (Morrow/Lara), and past failure explicitly confronted (David''s death,
    warehouse hunch). All 4 beats (Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint) are
    clearly executed. The narrative is engaging, well-paced, and builds tension effectively.'
