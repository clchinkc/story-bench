  evidence: 'Version 0 introduced the core concept and Zara''s gadget but relied on
    poetic interiority and lacked an explicit adult dismissal and a clearly flawed
    mentor; the threshold danger was underplayed. Version 1 made the Scavenger’s Eye
    more concrete and pushed toward a more physical, reactive Zara, but some mature
    narration remained. Version 2 tightened voice and pacing, added time pressure
    and rising tide, and made Elara’s culpability explicit. The Final Draft consolidates
    these gains: Zara’s invention and improvised multi-tool are foregrounded, sensory
    worldbuilding (algae, sirens, silt) is stronger, Elara is a visibly flawed mentor
    who “helped bury” the archive, and real danger (flooding/tide/storm window) drives
    the crossing. Strengths (gadget detail, stakes, balance of hope/cynicism) were
    preserved; remaining weaknesses are minor adult-leaning narration in a few lines
    and the absence of the explicitly named adult (Mr. Hargrove) in the final excerpt
    despite being referenced in the revision notes. Overall the revisions directly
    addressed the major critiques and improved clarity, urgency, and character dynamics.'
