  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is exceptionally detailed with clear character architecture,
    signal design philosophy, and narrative structure. Output demonstrates strong
    adherence to plan with concrete behavioral isolation markers (spiral coffee cups,
    email templates, noise-canceling headphones, furniture barriers). Isolation shown
    through action, not exposition. Marcus Chen effectively challenges Yuki''s approach.
    Ghost as unconventional mentor works well—a mirror reflecting her own wisdom rather
    than external guidance. All four beats executed: Call (signal arrival), Refusal
    (turning back), Meeting Mentor (Ghost interaction), Threshold (choosing collaboration).
    Genuine human connection moment (Marcus''s daughter revelation) surprises Yuki
    authentically. Signal design avoids anthropomorphism—probability clouds, observer-dependent
    meaning, recursive time-loops feel genuinely alien. Narrative pacing strong, dialogue
    natural, emotional arc earned. WEAKNESSES: Psychological threshold could be more
    explicitly marked as the moment of internal transformation (it''s present but
    subtle). Signal characteristics described in plan but only partially demonstrated
    in output—could show more of the ''multidimensional probability cloud'' nature
    in actual scenes. The ''quantum linguistic properties'' concept mentioned in plan
    but not clearly illustrated in narrative. Minor: Ghost''s dialogue occasionally
    risks becoming too human-readable despite the concept. TECHNICAL: Plan-to-output
    fidelity excellent (88%). Character beats all present. Constraint #5 (psychological
    threshold) is satisfied but could be more pronounced. All other constraints clearly
    met. Story ends at threshold rather than beyond it, which is appropriate for this
    narrative structure but leaves transformation itself to implication.'
