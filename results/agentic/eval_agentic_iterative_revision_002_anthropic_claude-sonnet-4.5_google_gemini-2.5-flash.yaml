  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions, particularly in the
    opening image. Version 0 was generic, but subsequent versions added more specific,
    non-visual sensory details (humid air, July heat, sweat, exhaust, hot garbage,
    halal cart lamb, sticky keys). The audio clue (Mr. Chen's cart hitting the sidewalk
    seam) became more prominent and specific, evolving into a 'tuning fork' sound.
    Imani's character was consistently portrayed respectfully and her blindness as
    a strength, especially in the 'Fun and Games' and 'Bad Guys Close In' sections
    where her acute hearing and pattern recognition are key. The initial underestimation
    by Ramirez was clear, and the 'Fun and Games' section effectively built suspense
    and entertainment before the dark turn. The final version is a strong, concise
    opening.
