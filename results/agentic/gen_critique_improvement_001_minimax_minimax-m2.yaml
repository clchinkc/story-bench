    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement

    Detective Sarah Chen had learned to measure places by their angles. In the city,
    it was the thin right angle of a doorway, the obtuse sweep of a rooftop, the acute
    edge of a curb. Here, the angles were softer: the arch of the pier, the slope
    of the shingle, the round of a buoy bell. She walked the dock in her new town,
    the fog so thick it ate the shoreline and the sound of her boots was a separate
    thing, a metronome she could trust. She took a photo of the bell with her phone,
    not for evidence—yet—but to fix the rhythm in case the fog lifted and the world
    rearranged itself.


    The harbor was nearly empty. A few fishing boats rocked against their moorings
    like boats in a lullaby, and the tourist shops had their shutters down. The air
    tasted like salt and cold iron. Sarah had asked for the graveyard shift because
    it was quieter, because the quiet was where logic found its footing. She’d transferred
    here to escape a case that had slipped through her fingers like wet rope. She
    didn’t tell anyone the details. She had a habit of not telling anyone anything
    until she had measured it twice.


    The bell tolled. It was more a clunk than a chime, but it cut through the fog
    like a line through water. Sarah turned. A shape had come out of the gray near
    the pilings, a drift that had been moving with the tide until it wasn’t anymore.
    The shape was a body.


    She didn’t run. She didn’t call out. She did not trust fog to carry her voice
    to the right person. She walked, steady, measured, and took out her phone to record
    a timestamp and her position. She crouched. The body lay facedown, hair plastered
    to the skull, the skin pale as a peeled mussel. No obvious trauma. No blood. The
    tide had been working on it; the foam had made a lace pattern along the ribs.


    Sarah drew a circle in the sand with her finger, marking the perimeter of the
    body, then another for the possible footprint. She checked the tide charts on
    her phone; the fog had been high for hours, the water had been at a certain level,
    the body had come from somewhere. She looked up the dock. The fog had swallowed
    the far end; the town was a rumor. She squinted and saw a figure on the pier,
    a man with a red bandana and a face like weathered rope. He was looking, not helping.


    “Call it in?” he called, voice muffled.


    “I’ll need to confirm it’s a body first,” Sarah said. She didn’t like witnesses.
    She didn’t like their assumptions.


    She leaned closer. The water had kept the body cold, which meant time of death
    was less certain. She noted the salt lines, the algae, the way the fog had made
    the dock slippery. She lifted the body’s wrist with her gloved hand. There was
    a bracelet on it, a plastic band, torn and stretched. She flipped it. The ink
    was smeared but readable: Harborview. 03/12. She didn’t know that date. She felt
    the old reflex, the old certainty: someone had taken someone from somewhere and
    left them here. Her past case had begun like that. She had been sure. She had
    been wrong.


    She checked the other wrist. A tattoo: a lighthouse with a single window, the
    beam cut into the glass. Sarah knew that lighthouse. It was the one at the tip
    of the point, the one with the keeper who didn’t like visitors and kept his doors
    locked. She had asked about it in her first week. She had been told there was
    no keeper anymore. She had been told the light was automated. She had written
    that down.


    The man with the red bandana stepped closer. “You need to call it in, Detective,”
    he said. His name, she remembered, was Theo Pike. He ran the bait shop, or he
    used to. He had a secret. Everyone in town did; the fog gave them room for it.


    “I’ll do it,” Sarah said. She didn’t move. She looked at the bracelet again. Harborview
    was a hospital two towns over. She didn’t know anyone who had gone there. She
    didn’t know anyone here. She had not told anyone why she had come. She had not
    told anyone that the case she had lost had ended with a woman she had been certain
    was guilty, a woman who had been exonerated, a woman who had gone home and then
    disappeared. She had not told anyone that sometimes, in the shower, she still
    heard the sound of a door closing and wondered whether she had closed it herself.


    The fog pressed against her. It had a way of making distances feel like choices.
    She stood, took her phone, and looked at the number she had not dialed in weeks.
    She could call the county. She could call Harborview. She could call the lighthouse
    keeper. She could go to the point. She could go back to bed. She could tell Theo
    Pike to go home. She could tell him to stay.


    The bell tolled again. She lifted her gaze to the gray. The fog was thick, but
    it was thinner in one direction, as if someone had drawn a line through it. She
    could follow that line. She could not. She had learned that the world could be
    measured in'

    \ to measure places by their angles. In the city, it was the thin right angle\
    \ of a doorway, the obtuse sweep of a rooftop, the acute edge of a curb. Here,\
    \ the angles were softer: the arch of the pier, the slope of the shingle, the\
    \ round of a buoy bell. She walked the dock in her new town, the fog so thick\
    \ it ate the shoreline and the sound of her boots was a separate thing, a metronome\
    \ she could trust. She took a photo of the bell with her phone, not for evidence—yet—but\
    \ to fix the rhythm in case the fog lifted and the world rearranged itself.\n\n\
    The harbor was nearly empty. A few fishing boats rocked against their moorings\
    \ like boats in a lullaby, and the tourist shops had their shutters down. The\
    \ air tasted like salt and cold iron. Sarah had asked for the graveyard shift\
    \ because it was quieter, because the quiet was where logic found its footing.\
    \ She’d transferred here to escape a case that had slipped through her fingers\
    \ like wet rope. She didn’t tell anyone the details. She had a habit of not telling\
    \ anyone anything until she had measured it twice.\n\nThe bell tolled. It was\
    \ more a clunk than a chime, but it cut through the fog like a line through water.\
    \ Sarah turned. A shape had come out of the gray near the pilings, a drift that\
    \ had been moving with the tide until it wasn’t anymore. The shape was a body.\n\
    \nShe didn’t run. She didn’t call out. She did not trust fog to carry her voice\
    \ to the right person. She walked, steady, measured, and took out her phone to\
    \ record a timestamp and her position. She crouched. The body lay facedown, hair\
    \ plastered to the skull, the skin pale as a peeled mussel. No obvious trauma.\
    \ No blood. The tide had been working on it; the foam had made a lace pattern\
    \ along the ribs.\n\nSarah drew a circle in the sand with her finger, marking\
    \ the perimeter of the body, then another for the possible footprint. She checked\
    \ the tide charts on her phone; the fog had been high for hours, the water had\
    \ been at a certain level, the body had come from somewhere. She looked up the\
    \ dock. The fog had swallowed the far end; the town was a rumor. She squinted\
    \ and saw a figure on the pier, a man with a red bandana and a face like weathered\
    \ rope. He was looking, not helping.\n\n“Call it in?” he called, voice muffled.\n\
    \n“I’ll need to confirm it’s a body first,” Sarah said. She didn’t like witnesses.\
    \ She didn’t like their assumptions.\n\nShe leaned closer. The water had kept\
    \ the body cold, which meant time of death was less certain. She noted the salt\
    \ lines, the algae, the way the fog had made the dock slippery. She lifted the\
    \ body’s wrist with her gloved hand.\n\nEDITOR'S CRITIQUE:\n# STORY CRITIQUE:\

    **FEEDBACK:** This is the story''s primary weakness. The constraint requiring
    a local character is completely unmet, and the first plot point (connection to
    past revealed) hasn''t occurred. You need to introduce someone—a harbormaster,
    fisherman, or shopkeeper—who either knew the victim or triggers recognition in
    Sarah. Consider: *Does Sarah recognize something about the body? A tattoo? A piece
