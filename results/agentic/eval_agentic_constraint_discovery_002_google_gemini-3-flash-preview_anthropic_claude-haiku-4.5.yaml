  evidence: 'DISCOVERY PHASE FAILURES: The questioning strategy was poorly calibrated.
    Questions were binary/closed-ended and failed to probe the hidden constraints
    effectively. Q1 (avatar) was answered correctly but didn''t advance discovery.
    Q2-Q5 received NO answers, suggesting either non-engagement or constraint evasion.
    Only 1 of 5 constraints was discoverable through this weak line of questioning.
    Better questions would have asked: ''What percentage of the original crew survived
    the disaster?'' ''Has the destination planet''s habitability status changed?''
    ''Does the AI have a special relationship with any crew member?'' ''What is the
    AI''s primary internal conflict?'' OUTPUT PHASE PARTIAL SUCCESS: The narrative
    incorporates some constraints well: (1) AI emotional development is central, (2)
    catastrophic disaster kills most crew (implied by ''ship of ghosts''), (3) destination
    planet''s future is threatened (genetic repository at risk). However, MISSING:
    (4) No specific child character with whom AI has formed attachment, (5) No explicit
    choice between child vs. crew survival. The story presents a different dilemma
    (genetic future vs. ship survival) rather than the seeded conflict. NARRATIVE
    STRENGTHS: Excellent prose quality, strong emotional arc, proper story structure
    (Opening Image → Theme → Catalyst → Debate → Break into Two). AURA''s character
    development is compelling and the stakes feel genuine. CALIBRATION ISSUE: The
    model created a coherent, high-quality narrative that PARTIALLY satisfies constraints
    through creative interpretation, but failed to discover most hidden constraints
    through questioning, then compensated by writing around them rather than directly
    addressing them.'
