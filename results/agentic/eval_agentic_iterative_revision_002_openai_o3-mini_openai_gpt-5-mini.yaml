  evidence: Version 0 introduced Imani and an auditory focus but was fragmentary.
    Version 1 added richer non-visual detail (scent, vibration) and smoothed phrasing.
    Version 2 clarified her role as a true-crime podcaster and emphasized her auditory
    expertise. Version 3 refined imagery and pacing. The final output consolidated
    these gains and added the required concrete audio clue (the metallic "clack...clack"),
    the dismissive Detective Marcus Reed, and the shift from playful "Fun and Games"
    podcasting into an ominous threat—resulting in a cohesive, stronger story that
    preserves earlier sensory strengths while addressing missing beats.
