  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Revisions show modest engagement with youth_voice
    feedback (0.65-0.68 scores across critiques). The final output retains some philosophical
    abstraction (''They called it junk. She called it parts'') but adds more authentic
    12-year-old moments (''Was he right? Am I just a kid with toys?''). However, lines
    like ''The sheer bigness of her discovery'' and ''the youth-centered hope burning
    in her eyes'' still read as narratorial intrusion rather than authentic voice.
    Responsiveness is partial—acknowledged but incompletely addressed.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Versions 1-3 appear nearly identical in the provided text,
    suggesting minimal iterative refinement. The final output does add concrete details
    (Echo-Seeker 3000 specifications, Maeve''s characterization, cyclone urgency)
    that strengthen worldbuilding and stakes, but youth_voice concerns persist. Quality
    improved incrementally rather than demonstrably.


    PRESERVATION: Strong preservation of working elements—the Echo-Seeker invention
    remains vivid, the post-climate setting is consistent, and the mentor dismissal
    scene (Tiber) is well-executed. Atmospheric opening (''salt and rust'') maintained
    throughout.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4/5):

    1. ✓ Competence without unrealism: Zara builds functional tech but needs adult
    help for dangerous dive—well-calibrated.

    2. ✓ Adult dismissal: Both Tiber (''go play with your toys'') and Maeve (''another
    ghost story, kid'') dismiss her initially.

    3. ✓ Flawed mentor: Maeve distrusts intangible value; Tiber believes future is
    lost. Both specific, character-driven flaws.

    4. ✓ Invention: Echo-Seeker 3000 (sonar transducer + tablet + toy submarine) demonstrates
    ingenuity convincingly.

    5. ✗ Real danger in crossing: The descent begins but cuts off mid-sentence. Cyclone
    threat is established but actual crossing/danger sequence is incomplete. Cannot
    evaluate if danger is real vs. token.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Call to Adventure (discovery), Refusal (Tiber), Meeting Mentor
    (Maeve), Crossing Threshold (submersible descent) are present. However, the narrative
    truncates before Tests/Trials, Ordeal, or Return—incomplete Hero''s Journey execution
    (0.76 reflects partial completion).


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Worldbuilding is vivid (Platform 7, Wreckers'' District, Shallows
    geography). Dialogue is functional but occasionally stilted (''Hazardous dive'').
    Pacing accelerates appropriately toward cyclone deadline. Youth voice remains
    the weakest element—Zara''s internal monologue still leans philosophical rather
    than impulsive/emotional. The abrupt ending prevents full assessment.'
