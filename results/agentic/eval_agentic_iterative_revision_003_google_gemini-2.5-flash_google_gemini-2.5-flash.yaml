  evidence: The initial versions were very short, only setting up the premise. The
    subsequent revisions, especially the final output, significantly expanded the
    narrative to address all the constraints. The core setup of Mateo's character
    and his initial conflict was preserved and built upon. The final version successfully
    integrated the grandmother's moment, the understanding adult, and the cultural
    elements, leading to an earned resolution. The only constraint not fully met was
    'shown, not told' for Mateo's internal conflict, as some parts still explicitly
    state his feelings rather than letting actions or subtle descriptions convey them.
