  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Revisions show modest engagement with interiority
    feedback. Critiques consistently scored character_interiority at 0.64-0.65, identifying
    that Teddy''s inner life relied too heavily on exposition (''he clung to the routine
    like a lifeline, fearing that without it...'') rather than embodied experience.
    Final output attempts deeper interiority through physical sensations (''tremors
    of anxiety ripple through him,'' ''hands moving freely, gesturing'') and the phone
    impulse moment, but still leans on telling (''something inside him began to shift'').
    Response is partial—shows awareness but incomplete execution.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Minimal demonstrable improvement across versions. All
    four versions appear nearly identical in opening, suggesting limited revision
    work. The final output does add the Clara subplot and Mrs. Jenkins intersection,
    but these feel grafted rather than organically integrated. The core interiority
    issue persists: emotional states are named rather than revealed through action.
    The phone-to-Marlene moment is the strongest addition but stands isolated. Overall
    trajectory is flat-to-slight improvement.


    PRESERVATION: Strong opening prose preserved throughout (''familiar as the creaks
    in his bones,'' ''sun barely a whisper''). Sensory details maintained. However,
    the revision process appears to have added rather than refined, resulting in tonal
    inconsistency—lyrical opening gives way to more conventional narrative in middle
    sections.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4/5):

    1. ✓ SPECIFIC LOVING DETAIL OF ROUTINE: Well-executed. Morning ritual, sneakers,
    route specifics, familiar faces (Mrs. Jenkins, Mr. Patel, Johnson kids) create
    texture.

    2. ✓ DISRUPTION REVEALS AVOIDANCE: Construction blocks path; Teddy confronts that
    routine masked grief avoidance. Adequately shown.

    3. ✓ NEIGHBOR INTERSECTION: Mrs. Jenkins subplot present—shared vulnerability,
    garden project. However, this feels underdeveloped; her story doesn''t deeply
    intersect with Teddy''s emotional arc.

    4. ✓ LATE WIFE PRESENT THROUGH ABSENCE: Marlene woven throughout—recited conversations,
    empty spaces, phone impulse. Strong execution.

    5. ✗ NEW PATH OFFERS WHAT OLD COULDN''T: Partially satisfied. Park/Clara offer
    community and creativity, but the story doesn''t clearly articulate what the old
    path fundamentally lacked that the new path provides. The distinction remains
    vague.


    BEAT EXECUTION (Story Circle): 0.70

    - YOU: Established (Teddy''s routine) ✓

    - NEED: Implied (fear of change, grief avoidance) but not crystallized ✓

    - GO: Forced by construction, reluctant ✓

    - SEARCH: Wandering unfamiliar streets, finding park ✓

    - FIND: Clara, community, mural ✓

    - TAKE: Decides to embrace both paths ✓

    - RETURN: Revisits old route with new perspective ✓

    - CHANGED: Cautious optimism replaces weight of past ✓

    Beats present but execution lacks dramatic tension. The transformation feels gradual
    and muted rather than earned through genuine struggle.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: 0.68

    STRENGTHS: Evocative opening, sensory richness, thematic coherence around memory
    and change, the phone impulse moment shows subtlety.

    WEAKNESSES: Exposition-heavy interiority (''he realized how deeply he had been
    avoiding''), Clara introduced abruptly without sufficient grounding, Mrs. Jenkins
    subplot underdeveloped, ending feels slightly sentimental (''invitation to connect,
    to grow''), pacing uneven (weeks compressed into paragraphs), the mural''s significance
    underexplored. Prose quality varies—strong opening deteriorates into more conventional
    narrative.


    OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The story demonstrates competent execution of most constraints
    but shows limited responsiveness to critique feedback. The core weakness—relying
    on exposition rather than embodied interiority—persists despite three rounds of
    critique. Revisions appear additive rather than refinement-focused. The final
    output is readable and touching but falls short of the subtlety and depth the
    constraints demand.'
