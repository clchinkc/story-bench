  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: All three critiques identified emotional_complexity
    as the primary strength (0.78-0.88 range). The revision trajectory shows deliberate
    tightening of prose economy (V0→V3: ''sat hunched'' becomes ''hunched''; ''scrawled
    above a half-erased punchline'' becomes ''Punchlines bled dry-marker ink''). This
    directly addresses the implicit feedback that opening needed sharper specificity.
    The vending machine scene (added in final output) responds to critique emphasis
    on ''emotional nadir'' moments—providing the physical manifestation of breakdown
    that critiques praised.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0 establishes baseline with functional structure but
    generic emotional beats. V1-V2 show incremental refinement of language precision.
    V3/Final output demonstrates substantial leap: (1) Harper''s character deepens
    from ''new writer'' archetype to specific personality (''Sharpied punch lines,''
    ''Comedy = Tragedy + Wi-Fi''); (2) The ''almost breaks'' constraint is now crystallized
    in the vending machine moment—visceral, silent, undefended; (3) Theme articulation
    by Ravi (''Boat wants to sink'') gains narrative weight through repetition and
    Marcus''s response.


    PRESERVATION: Core strengths maintained across all versions: ''deli turkey'' simile,
    ''Red Vines like antidepressants,'' ''laughter floated off, thin as steam,'' ''charge
    you by the kiloton.'' The opening laugh mechanism remains intact. Emotional architecture
    (humor→sadness reveal→breakthrough) preserved and deepened. Network notes subplot
    (added in later versions) enriches thematic resonance without displacing original
    beats.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. ✓ Marcus makes us laugh before sadness revealed: ''Charge you by the kiloton''
    lands as genuine laugh; sadness emerges through ''laughter floated off, thin as
    steam'' and network rejection sequence.

    2. ✓ Theme stated by minor character: Ravi delivers ''Boat wants to sink'' twice—once
    as warning, once as validation. This is thematic anchor, not Marcus.

    3. ✓ Comedy craft specificity: ''The pause is the laugh'' (Harper''s beat theory),
    ''joke math is pristine,'' marker strokes ''steadier than the last''—technical
    language embedded in narrative.

    4. ✓ New writer sees through Marcus: Harper''s ''gauging where the armor dented,''
    her hesitation-then-push on the livestream pitch, her final uncertainty waiting
    for backpedal or credit-theft. She reads his patterns.

    5. ✓ Almost-breaks moment with joke cover: Vending machine scene—throat tightens,
    fingers tap uselessly, reflection quivers. Then: ''Scariest thing I''ve written
    is my rent check.'' The joke lands hollow; he hears it die.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Save the Cat structure present but subordinated to character arc
    (appropriate for character study). Inciting Incident: Harper arrives. Rising Action:
    Collaboration reveals Marcus''s defensive patterns. Midpoint: Network email creates
    false victory, then reversal. Dark Night: Vending machine + Harper''s vulnerability
    question. Breakthrough: Harper''s ''Dad helps'' pitch + Marcus''s acceptance.
    Final Image: Unvarnished laugh, ''entirely his.'' The beats serve emotional truth
    rather than plot mechanics.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose demonstrates professional-level specificity. Sensory
    details (fluorescent skin tone, dry-marker bleed, noodles congealing, cymbal strike
    cut off) create immersive writers'' room. Dialogue balances exposition with character
    voice—no explanatory speeches. The Brooklyn memory functions as thematic callback
    without sentimentality. Final paragraph achieves earned emotional release: ''It
    scared him. It saved him'' works because the preceding 2000 words have justified
    both clauses. The story respects reader intelligence; it doesn''t explain the
    breakthrough, it enacts it.'
