  evidence: Across revisions the piece keeps its strongest concrete details (the creaking
    third step, the painted ladybug, Marcus at the barbershop) while adding clearer
    interior beats and a named detour (Erskine, the community garden). The finale—Teddy
    kneeling to plant zinnias and planning to bring the urn—resolves the earlier avoidance.
    Revisions move from hinting at avoidance to directly staging it (the chain-link
    fence, the trembling hands, the unopened cards) and then provide a meaningful
    new possibility (the garden) that the old route could not offer. Overall polish,
    pacing, and emotional clarity increase steadily from the earliest version to the
    final text.
