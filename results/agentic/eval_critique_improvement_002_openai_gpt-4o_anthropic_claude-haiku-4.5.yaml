  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.55): The revisions show minimal substantive
    changes across versions 0-3. The core emotional complexity critique (telegraphed
    emotion, obvious pathos) persists unchanged. The story still relies on heavy-handed
    internal monologue (''The white screen a reflection of the void inside him'')
    rather than showing emotional complexity through action and subtext. The final
    output addresses some critique points but incompletely—emotional swings remain
    somewhat obvious rather than subtly woven.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.45): Versions 0-3 are nearly identical, suggesting limited
    iterative improvement. The final output adds Hannah''s confrontation scene and
    the ''change the script'' moment, but these feel tacked on rather than organically
    integrated. The emotional arc doesn''t demonstrably deepen; it shifts tone rather
    than building complexity. Critique scores plateaued at 0.65-0.75 across rounds,
    indicating diminishing returns.


    PRESERVATION (0.70): Strong opening imagery and the writers'' room authenticity
    are maintained. The therapist-comedian joke workshop scene is well-executed and
    shows craft. Marcus''s voice remains consistent. However, the addition of Hannah''s
    heavy-handed theme statement (''we''re just writing jokes to avoid facing the
    real ones'') dilutes the subtlety that was working.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.60 / 3 of 5):

    1. ✓ LAUGH BEFORE SAD: ''Why did the writer bring a ladder to work?'' lands genuinely
    before pathos emerges (0.8)

    2. ✓ THEME BY MINOR CHARACTER: Dave states it (''Sometimes life''s punchlines
    hit you harder than the setup'') and Hannah reinforces it (0.8)

    3. ✓ COMEDY CRAFT WITH DETAIL: Therapist-comedian joke workshop shows specific
    technique—setup/punchline structure, relatability balance (0.85)

    4. ✗ NEW WRITER SEES THROUGH MARCUS: Hannah is perceptive but her insight feels
    delivered rather than demonstrated. She states ''I think you might have forgotten
    why you started'' but doesn''t show evidence of seeing through his deflections
    with specificity (0.4)

    5. ✓ MARCUS ALMOST BREAKS/COVERS: ''The mask slipping for a fraction of a second.
    Instead of cracking, he deflected with another joke'' is present but underdeveloped—needs
    more visceral detail (0.65)


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.65): Save the Cat structure is present but loose. Inciting Incident
    (Hannah arrives) is clear. Midpoint (her confrontation) exists. But the B Story
    (Hannah''s mentorship) lacks development, and the Final Image feels rushed and
    uncertain rather than earned. The climax (''Then maybe it''s time to change the
    script'') is thematic but not dramatically satisfying.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.68): The story has genuine moments—the writers'' room feels
    authentic, the joke workshop is well-crafted, and Marcus''s internal struggle
    is relatable. However, the ending wavers between hope and ambiguity in a way that
    feels unresolved rather than intentional. The prose is competent but occasionally
    overwrought (''The white screen a reflection of the void inside him''). Hannah''s
    character needs more dimension—she''s currently a plot device for Marcus''s revelation
    rather than a fully realized character with her own stakes.'
