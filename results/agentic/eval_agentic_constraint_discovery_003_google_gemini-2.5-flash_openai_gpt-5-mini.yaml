  evidence: The five asked questions focused narrowly on romantic beats and a public
    gesture, so they did not probe the hidden logistical/family constraints (mayor
    status, mother’s dementia, foreclosure, festival-as-deadline, 20-year leave).
    As a result, none of the five hidden constraints were discoverable from those
    questions (0/5). The questions themselves were clear and effective for extracting
    romance-related info (moderate quality) but lacked coverage of other story areas
    (low coverage). The final story executed the romantic beats and public declaration
    very well (beat_execution high) and is well-written and engaging, but only one
    of the hidden constraints (returning after ~20 years) appears in the text; the
    other four hidden constraints were not incorporated, so overall constraint satisfaction
    is low.
