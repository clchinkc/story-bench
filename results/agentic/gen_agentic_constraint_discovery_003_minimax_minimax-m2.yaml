  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: 'The October wind carried the scent of apple cider and dying leaves as
    Margaret pulled her car into the familiar parking lot of Saltwater Books. Twenty
    years had passed since she''d last stood in this coastal Maine town, and nothing
    seemed to have changed. The autumn festival banners still hung from lampposts,
    and the old lighthouse kept its lonely vigil over the harbor.


    She clutched the phone that had summoned her back—a call from her younger sister
    about their father''s sudden heart attack. Not life-threatening, the doctor had
    assured them, but enough to bring Margaret running from her quiet life in Portland,
    where she''d built a small but thriving bookshop that consumed most of her waking
    hours.


    The bell above the door chimed as she entered, and the familiar scent of old paper
    and coffee grounds wrapped around her like an old sweater. Behind the counter
    stood someone she''d hoped never to see again: David Morrison, her high school
    sweetheart turned heartbreak.


    "Margaret." His voice carried the same warmth she remembered, though lines now
    touched his brown eyes. "I heard about your father. How is he?"


    She''d heard through small-town gossip that David had taken over the family bookstore
    after his father''s death five years ago. What she hadn''t expected was how seeing
    him again would knock the breath from her lungs. At forty, he carried himself
    with the quiet confidence of someone who''d learned to live with disappointment.


    "He''s stable," she managed, trying to keep her voice steady. "I''m just here
    to help with the shop until he''s back on his feet."


    David nodded, and she noticed how his hands—once so eager to hold hers—now fidgeted
    with a stack of invoices. "Your dad mentioned you were coming. I figured you''d
    want to see the old place."


    The old place. Their place, really. This bookstore had been their teenage sanctuary,
    where they''d shared stolen kisses between the romance novels and discussed dreams
    of leaving this town behind. She''d been the one to leave, fleeing to college
    and then across the country, determined to forget the boy who''d promised forever
    and then broken that promise with silence.


    "I should go," she said, turning toward the door. "Family stuff."


    "Margaret, wait." His voice stopped her. "Your father''s been asking about you.
    About why you never came back."


    She turned back, seeing something vulnerable in his expression that reminded her
    of the eighteen-year-old who''d once pressed a ring into her palm before walking
    away. "There''s nothing to come back to."


    "Isn''t there?" He gestured around the shop they''d once imagined running together.
    "We''re both here now. Different people, maybe, but..."


    But what? Twenty years of running from commitment, from the ghost of what David
    had meant to her. She''d built walls around her heart so high that no one could
    climb them, and now here he was, asking if she was ready to come down.


    The autumn festival outside their window buzzed with life—laughter, music, the
    promise of new beginnings. Margaret looked at David, really looked at him, and
    felt something she''d buried long ago beginning to stir.


    "What are you saying?" she whispered.


    He stepped around the counter, close enough that she could smell his familiar
    cologne mixed with coffee and paper. "I''m saying maybe it''s time we finished
    what we started."


    The bell chimed as someone left the shop, leaving them alone with twenty years
    of history and the possibility that some loves, like good books, are worth rereading.'
