  evidence: The initial versions (0-3) were identical, indicating no iterative improvement
    based on critiques until the final output. The final output successfully integrated
    several critique points, particularly regarding the emotional complexity and the
    balance of humor and pathos. The constraint about Marcus making us laugh *before*
    we realize he's sad was met, as was the minor character stating the theme. The
    new writer's non-naivety and Marcus's almost-break moment were also present. However,
    the 'craft of comedy writing with specific detail' was only partially met; while
    there's a discussion of joke structure, it doesn't delve into the 'craft' in a
    truly detailed way. The Save the Cat beats are present but feel somewhat rushed,
    especially the 'All Is Lost' and 'Dark Night of the Soul' moments, which are more
    implied than fully explored.
