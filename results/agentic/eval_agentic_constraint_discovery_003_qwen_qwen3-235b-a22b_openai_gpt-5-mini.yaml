  evidence: 'No questions were asked, so discovery metrics are zero. Of the five hidden
    constraints: (1) protagonist left town 20 years ago — the story implies a 20-year
    absence but does not link it to a broken engagement; (2) former fiancé now mayor
    and unmarried — not present (Jack is a carpenter; no mayor); (3) mother has early-stage
    dementia — not present (mother is described as recently dead); (4) bookshop facing
    foreclosure/must be saved — partially present (debts, final notice, zoning/condemnation
    threat; motive to save the shop is included); (5) autumn festival in 2 weeks is
    the last chance — effectively present (Harvest Moon/Festival is the pivotal event
    to revive/save the shop). Beats (exposition, rising action, climax) are clearly
    executed, though there are some narrative confusions (e.g., ambiguous line about
    who was whose fiancée and incorrect mother condition). Overall story is coherent
    and engaging but diverges from several hidden constraints.'
