  evidence: Only the shop-threat/save and festival-as-save are incorporated (2 of
    5). The story includes 'twenty years away' but not the broken-engagement cause.
    The former fiancé-as-mayor and mother's early-stage dementia are missing; mother
    is described as dead. The festival is used to save the shop but the explicit 'in
    2 weeks' timeframe is absent. Question log shows mostly negative answers, indicating
    no hidden constraints were discovered via questioning.
error: null
