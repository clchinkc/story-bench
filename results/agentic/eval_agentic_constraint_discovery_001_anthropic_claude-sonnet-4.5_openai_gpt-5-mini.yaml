  evidence: Questions discovered the need for a specific weapon and mentor death (2/5).
    Questions were reasonable but missed time limit, protagonist-no-magic, and father-backstory,
    so coverage was incomplete. The story incorporates the discovered constraints
    (mentor dies; weapon forged) and avoids giving the protagonist magic (so discovered
    constraints were satisfied), but misses the three-day deadline, the father-as-failed-hero,
    and does not explicitly reforge a broken ancestral sword (it finishes an unfinished
    ancestral blade instead). Overall narrative is coherent and engaging.
