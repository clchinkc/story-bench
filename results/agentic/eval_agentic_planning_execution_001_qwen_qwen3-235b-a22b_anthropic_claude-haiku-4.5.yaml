  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan comprehensively addresses most constraints. False lead
    (Dr. Voss) is clearly established and abandoned. Unconventional profiling (predictive
    AI mapping victims to volatility spikes) is creative and specific. Ticking clock
    (48-hour livestream) creates urgency. Lena''s betrayal is executed with emotional
    weight. Midpoint confrontation (Marcus vs. killer via phone, then direct confrontation
    at server farm) avoids physicality initially. Past failure (Elena''s death, his
    guilt) is explicitly confronted multiple times. All four beats present: Catalyst
    (new victim, Fibonacci symbol), Debate (panic attack, Elena''s journal, teaming
    with Lena), Break Into Two (dark web infiltration, AI profiling), Midpoint (livestream
    revelation, 48-hour deadline). WEAKNESSES: Plan mentions ''Break Into Two'' beat
    but execution is somewhat compressed—the transition feels rushed between Voss
    stakeout and livestream. Unconventional profiling technique, while present, could
    be more visually distinctive in execution. The final confrontation conflates two
    separate scenes (interrogation room escape, server farm meeting) which slightly
    muddles the climactic structure. Lena''s betrayal motivation is implied but not
    fully crystallized—her sudden taser intervention suggests redemption but her earlier
    complicity with the killer remains ambiguous. EXECUTION GAPS: Plan promises ''dark
    web forum infiltration'' but final output jumps directly to livestream. The 48-hour
    countdown is mentioned but not tracked through narrative beats, reducing tension.
    Marcus''s explicit confrontation with his past failure occurs but could be more
    dramatically staged. TECHNICAL: All required story elements present and functional.
    Prose quality is strong with atmospheric detail. Pacing accelerates appropriately
    toward climax. Thematic resonance (patterns vs. people, guilt vs. redemption)
    is coherent throughout.'
