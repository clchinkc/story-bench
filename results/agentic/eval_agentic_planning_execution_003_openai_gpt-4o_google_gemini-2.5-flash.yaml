  evidence: "The plan addresses all constraints and beats. It is mostly specific,\
    \ though some details like the exact nature of Mr. Kim's representation could\
    \ be clearer. The output adheres very well to the plan, only slightly deviating\
    \ by introducing Mr. Kim's illness earlier than planned. \n\nConstraints:\n- Food\
    \ used symbolically twice: Yes (kimchi for grief, jeongol for unity, bibimbap\
    \ for harmony). \n- David's grief present but not explicit: Yes, handled well\
    \ through the kimchi and his admission about the restaurant being 'all I had left\
    \ of her'.\n- Daughter's estrangement cause: Yes, 'burying himself in work, abandoning\
    \ her'.\n- Regular customer represents something: Yes, Mr. Kim represents 'tradition\
    \ and continuity' and later 'life's fleeting nature'.\n- Ending hopeful but not\
    \ unrealistically happy: Yes, they are building something new, but the restaurant\
    \ is gone.\n- Korean cultural element beyond food: Yes, samulnori drumming. \n\
    \nAll constraints are met. The beats are clearly executed. The narrative quality\
    \ is good, with a clear arc and emotional resonance, though the pacing feels a\
    \ little rushed towards the end."
