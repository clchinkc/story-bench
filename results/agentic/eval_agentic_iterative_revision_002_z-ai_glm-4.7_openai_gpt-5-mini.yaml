  evidence: 'V0 established strong ambient smell and humidity but was visually framed
    and cut off. V1 responded by adding tactile detail (braille label) and a clearer
    rhythmic fan, improving the non-visual focus. V2 further increased tactile grounding
    (cool metal of the mic, sweat, ozone) and refined sounds. V3 preserved those gains
    and added explicit mixing-console tactile cues and richer street-sound textures.
    The final version successfully introduces a concrete audio clue (scrape-clank
    of a cart on a grate) that becomes the catalyst, makes Imani’s auditory skill
    central (using decay and resonance to locate the caller), and includes a character
    who initially underestimates her (Detective Miller). The trajectory shows consistent
    improvement in sensory detail and in portraying blindness as an asset. Shortcomings:
    the final ends mid-sentence, which undercuts narrative closure and weakens the
    turn from entertaining ''game'' to darker stakes; a couple earlier explicit markers
    (e.g., the braille label wording from V1) were transformed into implied cues rather
    than kept verbatim, but the tactile evidence remains. Overall constraints are
    met, beats are executed well, but the incomplete last line and slightly rushed
    ''fun and games'' to dark transition reduce final polish.'
