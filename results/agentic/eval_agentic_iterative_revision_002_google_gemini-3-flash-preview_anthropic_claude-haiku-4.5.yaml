  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0→1 show deliberate sensory expansion (V0''s
    ''cluttered mess'' becomes V1''s specific textures: ''braided nylon,'' ''brushed
    aluminum''). V1→2 tightens prose while maintaining texture detail, removes redundant
    ''visitor'' framing. V2→3 upgrades olfactory specificity (''charred lamb fat and
    cumin'' vs generic ''roasting halal meat''), adds tactile verb (''feeling the
    notched resistance''). Final output sustains these gains while dramatically escalating
    narrative stakes. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Non-visual sensory details PROMINENT—humidity
    pulsing, scents (cumin, sandalwood, bleach-starch), tactile mapping (braided nylon,
    brushed aluminum, damp velvet), auditory precision (400Hz click-whirr-chirp, deviated
    septum wheeze, lateral-worn boots). (2) Blindness as STRENGTH—Imani''s sensory
    specialization enables detective work Miller cannot perform; her darkness becomes
    sanctuary and tactical advantage; she doesn''t need light to locate target. (3)
    SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE—MedTech-7 insulin pump''s distinctive 400Hz click-whirr-chirp
    sequence is both plot catalyst and climactic weapon (waiting for ''next chirp'').
    (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION—Detective Miller explicitly dismisses her (''stay
    behind the mic,'' ''real police work happens in the light''), creating ironic
    reversal when her auditory expertise proves superior. (5) FUN AND GAMES ENTERTAINMENT—Archive
    diving at 600 wpm, cross-referencing missing persons, verbal sparring with Miller
    (''Squatters don''t use four-thousand-dollar medical devices'') genuinely entertains
    before tonal shift at window intrusion. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening Image establishes
    Imani''s sensory mastery through specific examples (pile driver→circular saw,
    Mr. Henderson''s shuffle). Catalyst is precise and earned (ghost hunt recording
    contains hidden medical device signature). Fun and Games balances intellectual
    puzzle-solving with character dynamics. Bad Guys Close In executes tonal pivot
    masterfully—satisfaction evaporates, then intruder arrives with sensory markers
    (sandalwood, bleach-starch, deviated septum wheeze). Final image positions Imani
    as tactical agent, not victim. PRESERVATION: Sensory specificity maintained throughout;
    Imani''s characterization deepens rather than shifts; audio clue threads consistently
    from discovery to climax. Minor weakness: final confrontation cuts off before
    resolution, leaving narrative incomplete, though this may be intentional excerpt
    format.'
