  content: 'Write a story with the following requirements:


    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

    Marcus Webb stood before the whiteboard like a surgeon examining an X-ray, marker
    poised over a half-finished joke structure. "Okay, so we''ve got setup, escalation,
    callback—but where''s the release valve?" He drew arrows between story beats with
    mechanical precision. "The audience needs to breathe before we hit them with the
    runner about Dennis''s weird nephew."


    The writing room erupted in dutiful laughter. Marcus had perfected the art of
    being funny without feeling it—comedy as muscle memory, jokes as currency. He''d
    been mining the same vein for three years: suburban dad confusion, workplace incompetence,
    the reliable rhythms of a multi-cam sitcom.


    "You''re like a joke machine," said Pete, the showrunner, unwrapping his third
    turkey sandwich. "Sometimes I wonder if you ever just... turn off."


    Marcus shrugged. "Comedy doesn''t sleep. Neither do we." Another laugh, another
    deposit in his reputation bank. He glanced at the empty chair where their newest
    hire would sit. Fresh blood to sacrifice to the sitcom gods.


    The door opened. Marcus expected another caffeine-dependent twenty-something with
    film school dreams and a trust fund safety net. Instead, a woman in her thirties
    walked in, carrying a beaten laptop and the kind of confidence that comes from
    surviving other writers'' rooms.


    "Zoe Martinez," she said, scanning the joke graveyard on the walls. "I read your
    pilot spec, Marcus. The one about the grief counselor who can''t cry. Brilliant
    structure—you buried the pain so deep it became the punchline."


    Marcus blinked. That wasn''t supposed to be about— "Thanks. That one never went
    anywhere."


    "Because it was too honest," Zoe said, settling into her chair. "Networks want
    comedy that confirms what people already feel. Your script asked them to feel
    something new."


    Pete clapped his hands. "Alright, let''s break the B-story. Marcus, walk us through
    the beats."


    Marcus turned to the board, but his handwriting looked foreign suddenly. Setup-punchline-tag.
    Rinse, repeat. "So, uh..." He stared at his own arrows, the algebraic proof of
    manufactured laughter. "Dennis finds out his nephew collects vintage doorknobs."


    "Why?" Zoe asked.


    "Because... it''s weird? Unexpected?"


    "But why does Dennis care? What does it cost him emotionally?"


    The room went quiet. Marcus felt something crack behind his sternum—a fault line
    he''d been careful not to disturb. "It''s not that kind of show. We''re not...
    we don''t go deep. We keep it light." He forced a grin. "Light comedy, light consequences.
    Nobody gets hurt, nobody learns anything, and we all get renewed."


    Zoe nodded slowly. "Must be nice, never having to risk anything real."


    The crack widened. Marcus gripped the marker harder, feeling three years of stored
    laughter threatening to escape as something else entirely. "Well, at least my
    family still talks to me," he said quickly, deploying the kind of sharp deflection
    that had become his signature. "Can''t say that about every comedy writer."


    More laughter. Crisis averted.


    But Zoe didn''t laugh. She just watched him with the same expression he''d once
    worn, back when comedy felt like truth-telling instead of truth-hiding. Back when
    making people laugh meant sharing something, not just manipulating them.


    Pete crumpled his sandwich wrapper. "You know what the problem is with comedy
    today? Everyone''s afraid to fail. Back in my day, we''d throw anything at the
    wall. Half of it was garbage, but the other half..." He gestured vaguely at the
    Emmy nominations on the wall. "You can''t find the good stuff if you''re not willing
    to dig through the shit. Comedy''s about connection, not perfection."


    Marcus stared at the whiteboard, seeing comedy equations where jokes used to live.
    When had structure become a cage instead of a tool? When had he stopped mining
    for truth and started manufacturing it?


    "So," Zoe said, opening her laptop. "What if Dennis''s nephew isn''t just weird?
    What if he''s the only family member who still visits Dennis''s mother in hospice
    care? And Dennis resents him for being brave enough to face grief while Dennis
    hides behind work?"


    Marcus looked at her, then at the board, then at his hands still stained with
    marker ink from three years of writing jokes about nothing.


    For the first time in months, he felt the urge to actually write something.'

    ## CRITERION: Emotional Complexity

    **SCORE: 0.72**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Humor: "The writing room erupted in dutiful laughter" / "Another laugh, another
    deposit in his reputation bank"

    - Pathos: "The crack widened. Marcus gripped the marker harder, feeling three
    years of stored laughter threatening to escape as something else entirely"


    **FEEDBACK:** The pathos lands effectively—the metaphor of structural "cages"
    and the marker stain revelation are genuinely poignant. However, the humor underperforms.
    You *describe* laughter but don''t create moments where readers actually laugh
    at Marcus''s comedy before realizing his emptiness. The "Well, at least my family
    still talks to me" deflection is sharp, but we need a genuine laugh earlier—an
    actual joke that lands before we feel the pain beneath it. Consider giving Marcus
    one complete, well-crafted joke in the opening to establish his skill before revealing
    its hollowness.

    ## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction

    **SCORE: 0.80**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    1. ✓ Marcus laughs: "dutiful laughter" / deflection quip (but not a full comedic
    beat)

    2. ✓ Theme by minor character: Zoe: "Networks want comedy that confirms what people
    already feel" / Pete: "Comedy''s about connection, not perfection"

    3. ✓ Comedy craft detail: "setup, escalation, callback" / "release valve" / "Setup-punchline-tag"

    4. ✓ Zoe sees through him: "you buried the pain so deep it became the punchline"

    5. ✓ Breakage + joke cover: The family comment perfectly executes this


    **FEEDBACK:** Constraint #1 is weakly executed. The phrase "Marcus must make us
    laugh at least once" suggests an actual comedic moment, but we get reported laughter
    instead. Strengthen this by showing Marcus deliver a complete joke *with the punchline*
    early—something that objectively lands funny before we understand it''s compensation.
    Current handling is subtle but technically underperforms the constraint''s spirit.

    a year. I told my brother, ''Congratulations, you''re paying Harvard prices for
    YouTube University—except the only thing he''ll graduate with is carpal tunnel

    \ Marcus's realization feels more intellectual (\"when had structure become a\

    \ emotional unraveling—what does his body do in that moment? Does his hand shake?\
    \ Does he avoid Zoe's eyes? The phrase \"crack widened\" is good metaphorically,\
    \ but the story needs concrete, embodied details to make the pathos resonate beyond\
    \ abstraction.\n\n**Suggestion:** Add a moment where Marcus physically cannot\
    \ deliver his usual deflection—perhaps his voice cracks, or he can't maintain\

    \n**FEEDBACK:**\nThe three beats are present, but the *Theme Stated* arrives relatively\
    \ late (mid-story) and is delivered too cleanly. Zoe states it as near-fact rather\
    \ than as a question or observation that Marcus must process. Consider having\
    \ her pose it more obliquely: \"I wonder if this script needed to hurt more to\

    Marcus Webb stood before the whiteboard like a surgeon examining an X-ray, marker
    poised over a half-finished joke structure. "Okay, so we''ve got setup, escalation,
    callback—but where''s the release valve?" He drew arrows between story beats with
    mechanical precision. "The audience needs to breathe before we hit them with the
    runner about Dennis''s weird nephew."


    "Speaking of weird nephews," Marcus continued without missing a beat, "my brother''s
    kid just started college. Kid''s majoring in ''Digital Media Studies''—which is
    apparently what they call ''learning to make TikToks'' when it costs forty grand
    a year. I told my brother, ''Congratulations, you''re paying Harvard prices for
    YouTube University—except the only thing he''ll graduate with is carpal tunnel
    and a student loan that''ll outlive us all.''"


    The writing room exploded with genuine laughter. Marcus had perfected the art
    of being funny without feeling it—comedy as muscle memory, jokes as currency.
    He''d been mining the same vein for three years: suburban dad confusion, workplace
    incompetence, the reliable rhythms of a multi-cam sitcom.


    "You''re like a joke machine," said Pete, the showrunner, unwrapping his third
    turkey sandwich. "Sometimes I wonder if you ever just... turn off."


    Marcus shrugged. "Comedy doesn''t sleep. Neither do we." Another laugh, another
    deposit in his reputation bank. He glanced at the empty chair where their newest
    hire would sit. Fresh blood to sacrifice to the sitcom gods.


    The door opened. Marcus expected another caffeine-dependent twenty-something with
    film school dreams and a trust fund safety net. Instead, a woman in her thirties
    walked in, carrying a beaten laptop and the kind of confidence that comes from
    surviving other writers'' rooms.


    "Zoe Martinez," she said, scanning the joke graveyard on the walls. "I read your
    pilot spec, Marcus. The one about the grief counselor who can''t cry. Interesting
    structure—I wonder if it needed to hurt more to be funny."


    Marcus blinked. That wasn''t supposed to be about— "Thanks. That one never went
    anywhere."


    "Maybe because networks want comedy that confirms what people already feel," Zoe
    said, settling into her chair. "Safer that way."


    Pete clapped his hands. "Alright, let''s break the B-story. Marcus, walk us through
    the beats."


    Marcus turned to the board, but his handwriting looked foreign suddenly. Setup-punchline-tag.
    Rinse, repeat. "So, uh..." He stared at his own arrows, the algebraic proof of
    manufactured laughter. "Dennis finds out his nephew collects vintage doorknobs."


    "Why?" Zoe asked.


    "Because... it''s weird? Unexpected?"


    "But why does Dennis care? What does it cost him emotionally?"


    The room went quiet. Marcus felt something crack behind his sternum—a fault line
    he''d been careful not to disturb. "It''s not that kind of show. We''re not...
    we don''t go deep. We keep it light." He forced a grin, but his hand trembled
    slightly around the marker. "Light comedy, light consequences. Nobody gets hurt,
    nobody learns anything, and we all get renewed."


    Zoe watched him carefully. "Must be nice, never having to risk anything real."


    The crack widened. Marcus gripped the marker harder, feeling three years of stored
    laughter threatening to escape as something else entirely. His voice came out
    rougher than intended: "Well, at least my family still talks to me. Can''t say
    that about every comedy writer."


    This time the laughter felt delayed, nervous. A few uncomfortable glances.


    But Zoe didn''t laugh at all. She just watched him with the same expression he''d
    once worn, back when comedy felt like truth-telling instead of truth-hiding. Marcus
    couldn''t meet her eyes, focusing instead on the whiteboard''s sterile equations.


    Pete crumpled his sandwich wrapper, filling the awkward silence. "You know what
    the problem is with comedy today? Everyone''s afraid to fail. Back in my day,
    we''d throw anything at the wall. Half of it was garbage, but the other half..."
    He gestured vaguely at the Emmy nominations on the wall. "You can''t find the
    good stuff if you''re not willing to dig through the shit. Comedy''s about connection,
    not perfection."


    Marcus stared at the whiteboard, seeing comedy equations where jokes used to live.
    When had structure become a cage instead of a tool? When had he stopped mining
    for truth and started manufacturing it? His hands were trembling now, marker stains
    like evidence of three years spent writing jokes about nothing.


    "So," Zoe said quietly, opening her laptop. "What if Dennis''s nephew isn''t just
    weird? What if he''s the only family member who still visits Dennis''s mother
    in hospice care? And Dennis resents him for being brave enough to face grief while
    Dennis hides behind work?"


    Marcus looked at her, then at the board, then at his shaking hands. For the first
    time in months, he felt the urge to actually write something that might hurt.'

    \ shift, but it arrives too suddenly in the third act. The opening joke about\
    \ \"YouTube University\" lands effectively, establishing Marcus as genuinely funny\
    \ before revealing the hollowness. However, the emotional unraveling compressed\
    \ into the final scenes feels rushed. The crack metaphor is strong, but it needs\
    \ more gradual fissuring earlier—perhaps a moment where a joke doesn't land as\
    \ expected, or where Marcus notices his laughter sounds false. Consider weaving\
    \ more small hesitations throughout the first half to build the emotional complexity\
    \ incrementally rather than as a sudden revelation. The ending promise (\"he felt\

    \n---\n\n## CRITERION: CONSTRAINT_SATISFACTION\n**SCORE: 0.80**\n\n**BREAKDOWN:**\n\

    \ (primary) and Pete: \"You can't find the good stuff if you're not willing to\
    \ dig through the shit. Comedy's about connection, not perfection\" (reinforcement).\
    \ Neither statement comes from Marcus himself.\n\n✓ **Constraint 3 - Show craft\
    \ with specific detail:**\n\"Setup, escalation, callback,\" the whiteboard arrows,\
    \ \"Setup-punchline-tag. Rinse, repeat.\" Strong demonstration of technical structure.\n\
    \n⚠ **Constraint 4 - New writer cannot be naive:**\nZoe immediately challenges\
    \ Marcus's work: \"Interesting structure—I wonder if it needed to hurt more to\
    \ be funny.\" This works, though she could demonstrate more insider knowledge\
    \ earlier (beyond reading a spec script).\n\n⚠ **Constraint 5 - Marcus breaks\
    \ but covers with a joke:**\n\"Well, at least my family still talks to me. Can't\
    \ say that about every comedy writer.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** This doesn't read as\
    \ Marcus *covering* with humor—it reads as him lashing out defensively. A true\
    \ joke-cover would redirect tension into actual comedy. For example, if Marcus's\
    \ hand trembles and he says, \"Wow, Zoe really knows how to kill a mood. I tried\
    \ that once—killed my marriage too,\" the audience would laugh *and* recognize\

    **SCORE: 0.75**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\n**Opening Image:** \"Marcus Webb stood before\
    \ the whiteboard like a surgeon examining an X-ray, marker poised over a half-finished\
    \ joke structure.\"\n- ✓ Establishes Marcus in his element with clear visual metaphor\n\
    - ✓ The \"hollow\" mastery is implied through \"perfected,\" \"muscle memory\"\
    \n\n**Theme Stated:** Zoe's challenge + Pete's speech\n- ✓ Clearly articulated\
    \ (\"Comedy's about connection, not perfection\")\n- ✓ Delivered by secondary\
    \ characters\n\n**Catalyst:** \"The door opened. Marcus expected another caffeine-dependent\
    \ twenty-something... Instead, a woman in her thirties walked in...\"\n- ✓ Disrupts\
    \ status quo\n- ✓ Clearly marked as turning point\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The beats are\
    \ structurally correct but feel marked with obvious signposting. Real stories\
    \ should make readers feel the shifts without narration highlighting them. The\
    \ line \"Marcus expected another caffeine-dependent twenty-something... Instead\"\
    \ too explicitly telegraphs: \"This is the Catalyst, notice the contrast.\" Similarly,\
    \ Pete's speech announcing the theme (literally discussing digging through shit\
    \ for truth) is on-the-nose. Consider making Zoe's challenge to the joke about\
    \ nephews the true theme moment—let readers infer the meaning rather than having\
    \ Pete lecture it directly.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: INDUSTRY_AUTHENTICITY\n**SCORE:\

    \ \"Must be nice, never having to risk anything real.\"\n\nThe crack widened.\

    \ laughter felt thin, performative. \n\nBut Zoe didn't laugh at all. She just\
    \ watched him with the same expression he'd once worn, back when comedy felt like\
