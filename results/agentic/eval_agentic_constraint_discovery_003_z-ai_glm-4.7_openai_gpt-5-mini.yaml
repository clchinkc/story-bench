  evidence: None of the five hidden constraints were effectively uncovered by the
    question set (questions missed the mayor/former-fiancé status, mother's dementia,
    shop foreclosure, and festival-as-last-chance). The story does incorporate a returned-for-legal/estate
    beat and a rekindled-high-school-sweetheart meeting and a clear climax/resolution,
    but it omits the key stakes (bookshop foreclosure and autumn-festival deadline),
    the mother's dementia, and the mayor/former-fiancé detail. Writing quality and
    emotional arc are coherent and engaging, but required hidden constraints and corresponding
    beats are largely absent.
