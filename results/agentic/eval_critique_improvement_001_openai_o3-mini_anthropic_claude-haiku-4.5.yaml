  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer addressed the core constraint of
    showing Sarah''s methodical nature through action across all versions, with progressive
    refinement (V0: ''methodically arranged,'' V3: ''methodically arranging'' with
    added ''care of a surgeon''). However, responsiveness to fog''s narrative purpose
    was inconsistent—early critiques noted fog as atmospheric, but final output still
    relies heavily on fog as mood-setting rather than active plot mechanism. The writer
    added the fog-obscuring-footprints scene (beat 2) which shows some narrative integration,
    but fog remains largely decorative. IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0→V1 showed modest
    gains in prose tightness (''swallowed sound and sight'' → ''swallowed by dense
    fog''). V1→V2 improved tool arrangement specificity (''bench'' detail). V2→V3
    added ''practiced ease'' and ''care of a surgeon'' simile, strengthening methodical
    characterization. However, the final output doesn''t substantially exceed V3—it
    expands rather than refines. The addition of Evelyn and the photograph scene adds
    complexity but dilutes focus. PRESERVATION: Strengths preserved include Sarah''s
    methodical tool arrangement (consistent across all versions), the fog-obscured
    footprints reveal (new in final), and the decision-point ending. Weaknesses partially
    addressed: local secrets now include both Greg and Evelyn with hints of connection
    to Sarah''s past, improving constraint satisfaction. However, the past case hint
    (photograph scene) feels rushed and expository rather than organically woven.
    CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS: (1) Methodical nature through action: SATISFIED (0.85)—tool
    arrangement, careful evidence handling, deliberate note-taking shown consistently.
    (2) Fog serves narrative purpose: PARTIALLY SATISFIED (0.65)—fog obscures footprints
    (functional), but also used for atmosphere/mood; not fully integrated as active
    obstacle. (3) Local character with secret: SATISFIED (0.80)—Greg''s furtiveness
    and Evelyn''s guilt both present, though underdeveloped. (4) Past case hinted
    before revealed: PARTIALLY SATISFIED (0.70)—photograph scene reveals too directly;
    hints should precede this more subtly. (5) End on decision, not resolution: SATISFIED
    (0.85)—final paragraph presents stark choice between ''safety of hard facts''
    or following ''elusive trail.'' BEAT EXECUTION: Beat 1 (Setup/Arrival): Strong
    (0.85)—fog, village decay, tool arrangement establish tone and character. Beat
    2 (Complication/Discovery): Good (0.78)—body discovery, footprint analysis, fog
    interference create momentum. Beat 3 (Decision Point): Good (0.75)—final paragraph
    presents choice, though somewhat abstract; could be more concrete. NARRATIVE QUALITY:
    Prose is competent with strong moments (''care of a surgeon,'' fog as ''living
    mirror'') but suffers from: (1) Overwriting in places (''tangled truths hidden
    in both the mist and her memories'' is redundant); (2) Tonal inconsistency—shifts
    between noir-detective and literary mystery; (3) Pacing issues—Evelyn scene feels
    inserted rather than earned; (4) Dialogue (''Some relics bear truths too dangerous
    to speak outright'') is on-the-nose. The final decision moment is thematically
    resonant but lacks concrete specificity about what Sarah will actually do. REVISION
    QUALITY: The trajectory shows incremental polish rather than structural improvement.
    V3→Final adds character depth but introduces new problems (Evelyn exposition,
    photograph reveal timing). The writer prioritized adding content over refining
    existing elements.'
