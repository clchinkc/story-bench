  evidence: The initial versions focused heavily on the market setting and sensory
    details, which were good but didn't advance the core conflict. Revision 3 and
    the final output successfully shifted the focus to Mateo's internal conflict,
    introducing the pre-med program dilemma early. The grandmother's scene was moved
    to a more impactful position, and Mr. Rivera was introduced as the understanding
    adult. The cultural elements remained authentic throughout. The resolution feels
    earned through Mateo's actions and the support he receives. The only constraint
    not fully met is 'shown, not told' for Mateo's internal conflict, as there are
    still moments where his thoughts are explicitly stated rather than inferred from
    his actions or dialogue, though it's significantly improved from earlier versions.
