  evidence: The quality improved significantly across versions. Version 0 was a good
    start but lacked depth and character. Version 1 introduced 'vectored' and 'central
    nervous system' which were strong character descriptors. Version 2 added the crucial
    'But in the sterile silence of h...' which was the pivot point for Elena's flaw.
    Version 3 refined the opening and set up the contrast between her competence and
    her isolation. The final output successfully integrated all elements, creating
    a compelling narrative arc. The medical detail (0.9% sodium chloride) was present
    from early versions and preserved. The friendship felt genuine and earned through
    the interaction with Arthur. Elena's transformation was internal, and the ending
    was ambiguous. The only constraint not fully met was 'Must show Elena's competence
    before showing her flaw' as the flaw (isolation) is hinted at immediately after
    her competence is shown, rather than a clear separation. However, the competence
    is still established first.
