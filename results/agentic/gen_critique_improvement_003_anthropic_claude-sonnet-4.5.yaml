    STORY THEORY: Hero''s Journey


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Zara, a 12-year-old girl growing up in a post-climate-change coastal
    city

    where most adults have given up hope. She builds things from salvage and

    believes solutions exist if people would just look for them.


    - Setting: New Boston, 2089. A city of floating platforms, recycled materials,
    and

    perpetual sea spray. What was once downtown is now called the Shallows.


    - Central conflict: When Zara discovers the location of a pre-flood archive containing
    lost

    environmental technology, she must convince cynical adults to help her

    retrieve it before a storm erases it forever.


    - Tone: Hopeful but not naive, kinetic, youth-centered


    REQUIRED BEATS: Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing
    the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Zara must be competent without being unrealistically capable

    - At least one adult must initially dismiss her as ''just a kid''

    - The mentor figure must be flawed in a specific way

    - Include one invention of Zara''s that demonstrates her ingenuity

    - The crossing must involve real danger, not token obstacles


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - youth_voice: Does Zara sound authentically 12, not adult-in-miniature?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Hero''s Journey beats properly executed?

    - worldbuilding: Does the post-climate world feel vivid and consistent?

    - hope_balance: Is hope present without becoming saccharine?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

    Zara''s fingers were black with grease when she found the map. She''d been elbow-deep
    in the guts of a waterlogged desalinator she''d fished from the Shallows, her
    workbench floating gently on the platform outside Gran''s apartment. The sealed
    plastic sleeve had been wedged inside the pump housing, probably for fifty years.


    "Holy crap," she whispered, unfolding the laminated paper. It showed downtown—the
    real downtown, the drowned one—with a red X marked on what used to be the old
    library''s basement. Coordinates. And three words in faded marker: *Environmental
    Archive. Watertight.*


    Her heart hammered. Pre-flood tech could change everything. The desalinator she''d
    jerry-rigged from plastic bottles and copper wire worked, but barely. Real engineers
    had built real solutions before the city gave up and just... adapted.


    Gran found her an hour later, still staring at the map. "What''s got you so wound
    up?"


    "Look! There''s an archive in the Shallows, with tech from before—"


    "Zara." Gran''s voice went flat. "How many times? The old world''s gone, baby.
    Let it rest."


    "But if we could—"


    "We can''t." Gran turned away. "Dinner''s in ten."


    Zara folded the map against her chest. Adults always said that. *We can''t.* Like
    they''d forgotten how to try.


    ---


    She found Captain Chen at the salvage docks the next morning, checking the mooring
    lines on her diving boat. Chen was maybe fifty, with gray streaks in her hair
    and a scar across her knuckles from some accident nobody talked about.


    "I need to hire you," Zara announced.


    Chen didn''t look up. "Get lost, kid."


    "I can pay." Zara held up the solar cells she''d harvested from three broken calculators.
    "I rewired these into a functioning panel. Worth twenty trade credits, easy."


    That got Chen''s attention. She examined the panel, testing the connections. "Not
    bad. What''s the job?"


    Zara showed her the map.


    Chen''s expression hardened. "The Shallows? Storm''s coming in three days. Nobody
    dives there in storm season."


    "That''s why it has to be now! The storm surge could bury it for good, or—"


    "Listen to me carefully." Chen crouched down, eye-level. "I don''t risk my life
    on treasure hunts. Especially not for some kid chasing fairy tales."


    "It''s not a fairy tale!" Zara''s voice cracked. "It''s *real*. We could actually
    fix things instead of just surviving!"


    Chen stood, shaking her head. "Surviving *is* fixing things. You''ll understand
    when you''re older." She paused at the gangplank. "I dive at dawn, alone. Don''t
    follow me."


    But Zara heard what Chen didn''t say: *dawn*.


    ---


    She waited in the boat''s cargo hold before first light, heart racing every time
    footsteps crossed the deck above. When the engine rumbled to life, she almost
    chickened out. Then she remembered Gran''s dead voice: *Let it rest.*


    No. Some things were worth fighting for.


    The boat cut through dark water. Zara counted twenty minutes before climbing out,
    surprising Chen at the wheel.


    "You''ve got to be kidding me!" Chen killed the throttle. "I''m taking you back
    right—"


    "You can''t. The tide''s already shifted. We''d lose an hour."


    Chen''s jaw worked. "You manipulative little—"


    "You knew the map was real," Zara interrupted. "You studied it too long. And you
    said ''storm season,'' not ''always.'' Which means you *do* dive the Shallows,
    you just don''t want to admit you''re like me."


    Something flickered in Chen''s eyes. Fear, maybe. Or recognition.


    "My daughter was your age," Chen said quietly. "When the flood came." She turned
    back to the controls. "Strap in. The Shallows don''t forgive mistakes."


    The water ahead was dark brown, churning with debris and memories. Rusted skyscrapers
    jutted like broken teeth. Zara''s invention-panel blinked green in her backpack,
    ready to power whatever they found below.


    Chen piloted them toward the X, and Zara understood: this wasn''t about convincing
    anyone anymore.


    This was about diving into the deep.'

    Archive. Watertight.*


    Her heart hammered. Pre-flood tech could change everything. The desalinator she''d
    jerry-rigged from plastic bottles and copper wire worked, but barely. Real engineers
    had built real solutions before the city gave up and just... adapted.


    Gran found her an hour later, still staring at the map. "What''s got you so wound
    up?"


    "Look! There''s an archive in the Shallows, with tech from before—"


    "Zara." Gran''s voice went flat. "How many times? The old world''s gone, baby.
    Let it rest."


    "But if we could—"


    "We can''t." Gran turned away. "Dinner''s in ten."


    Zara folded the map against her chest. Adults always said that. *We can''t.* Like
    they''d forgotten how to try.

    She found Captain Chen at the salvage docks the next morning, checking the mooring
    lines on her diving boat. Chen was maybe fifty, with gray streaks in her hair
    and a scar across her knuckles from some accident nobody talked about.


    "I need to hire you," Zara announced.


    Chen didn''t look up. "Get lost, kid."


    "I can pay." Zara held up the solar cells she''d harvested from three broken calculators.
    "I rewired these into a functioning panel. Worth twenty trade credits, easy."


    That got Chen''s attention. She examined the panel, testing the connections. "Not
    bad. What''s the job?"


    Zara showed her the map.


    Chen''s expression hardened. "The Shallows? Storm''s coming in three days. Nobody
    dives there in storm season."


    "That''s why it has to be now! The storm surge could bury it for good, or—"


    "Listen to me carefully." Chen crouched down, eye-level. "I don''t risk my life
    on treasure hunts. Especially not for some kid chasing fairy tales."


    "It''s not a fairy tale!" Zara''s voice cracked. "It''s *real*. We could actually
    fix things instead of just surviving!"


    Chen stood, shaking her head. "Surviving *is* fixing things. You''ll understand
    when you''re older." She paused at the gangplank. "I dive at dawn, alone. Don''t
    follow me."


    But Zara heard what Chen didn''t say: *dawn*.


    ---


    She waited in the boat''s cargo hold before first light, heart racing every time
    footsteps crossed the deck above. When the engine rumbled to life, she almost
    chickened out. Then she remembered Gran''s dead voice: *Let it rest.*


    No. Some things were worth fighting for.


    The boat cut through dark water. Zara counted twenty minutes before climbing out,
    surprising Chen at the wheel.


    "You''ve got to be kidding me!" Chen killed the throttle. "I''m taking you back
    right—"


    "You can''t. The tide''s already shifted. We''d lose an hour."


    Chen''s jaw worked. "You manipulative little—"


    "You knew the map was real," Zara interrupted. "You studied it too long. And you
    said ''storm season,'' not ''always.'' Which means you *do* dive the Shallows,
    you just don''t want to admit you''re like me."


    Something flickered in Chen''s eyes. Fear, maybe. Or recognition.


    "My daughter was your age," Chen said quietly. "When the flood came." She turned
    back to the controls. "Strap in. The Shallows don''t forgive mistakes."


    The water ahead was dark brown, churning with junk and currents that could flip
    a boat. Rusted skyscrapers jutted like broken teeth. Zara''s stomach clenched.
    The solar panel in her backpack suddenly felt stupid and small against all that
    water.


    But Chen was piloting them toward the X, and Zara''s hands gripped the rail tight
    enough to hurt.

    CRITERION: youth_voice

    SCORE: 0.82/1.0


    EVIDENCE:

    - "Holy crap, she whispered" — age-appropriate vulgarity, not performative

    - "Like they''d forgotten how to try" — philosophical without sounding adult-coached

    - "voice cracked" — physical embodiment of emotion fits adolescence

    - However: "You manipulative little—" and her entire pitch to Chen feel strategically
    calculated in a way that reads slightly mature for 12


    FEEDBACK: Zara''s negotiation with Chen (stowing away, her rebuttal about the
    tide) is brilliant character work, but it borders on precocious. Ground it more
    in *luck* than *cunning*. Consider: what if she''d simply hidden out of panic,
    or Chen had found her by accident? The impulsiveness of youth would strengthen
    her voice. The bit where "her hands gripped the rail tight enough to hurt" is
    perfect—more of that visceral, uncontrolled reaction.

    CRITERION: constraint_satisfaction

    SCORE: 0.94/1.0


    EVIDENCE - All 5 constraints checked:

    1. ✓ "jerry-rigged from plastic bottles and copper wire" + calculator cells —
    credible 12-year-old ingenuity, not implausible

    2. ✓ Gran: "Let it rest." Chen: "Get lost, kid" + "You''ll understand when you''re
    older"

    3. ✓ Chen''s flaw hinted (trauma: "My daughter was your age"), but underdeveloped

    4. ✓ Desalinator + solar panels — two inventions showing range

    5. ✓ "Dark brown, churning with junk...Rusted skyscrapers jutted like broken teeth"
    — real environmental hazard, not a plot device


    FEEDBACK: The mentor''s flaw (grief-driven defeatism) is established but *shown*
    only in dialogue. Chen needs one *action* that reveals her specific flaw. Currently
    we learn she lost a daughter, but we don''t see how that shaped her caution. Does
    she check equipment obsessively? Does she hesitate before entering dangerous water?
    Make the flaw visceral, not explained.

    Zara''s fingers were black with grease when she found the map. She''d been elbow-deep
    in a waterlogged desalinator she''d fished from the Shallows, working on the platform
    outside Gran''s place. The sealed plastic sleeve had been wedged inside the pump
    housing, probably for fifty years.


    "Holy crap," she whispered, unfolding the laminated paper. It showed downtown—the
    real downtown, the drowned one—with a red X marked on what used to be the old
