  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions. Version 0 was a good
    start but lacked depth and specific details. Version 1 (not provided, but implied
    by the changes) likely started to incorporate more specific medical details and
    character interaction. Version 2 refined the opening to better establish Elena's
    competence. Version 3 further tightened the language and added the 'But...' transition,
    which was a strong improvement. The final output successfully integrated all the
    requested elements, creating a compelling narrative. The initial competence is
    clearly shown, the friendship feels earned through shared crisis, the transformation
    is internal, and the ending is ambiguous. The only constraint not fully met is
    the 'specific medical detail that serves the story' - while the backup neb is
    a medical detail, its role in the story is more about showing Elena's knowledge
    and the budding friendship than a unique plot point driven by that specific detail.
    However, it's a minor point in an otherwise excellent execution.
