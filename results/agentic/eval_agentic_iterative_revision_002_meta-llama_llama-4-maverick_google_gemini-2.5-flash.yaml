  evidence: The initial versions (0-2) were making progress towards setting a scene
    with non-visual sensory details. However, Version 3 and the final output completely
    abandon this progress and introduce new characters and a narrative that doesn't
    align with the initial setup. The final output is a generic description of a city
    walk, losing all specific details and failing to address any of the constraints.
    The prompt asked for an evaluation of 'agentic task outputs' and the final output
    is a complete departure from the initial task and constraints.
error: null
