  evidence: "The plan is mostly complete, covering the required beats and constraints.\
    \ It's specific in its descriptions of scenes and dialogue. The final output adheres\
    \ well to the plan, especially in the early beats. \n\nConstraint Satisfaction:\n\
    - False lead: Yes, the Thomas Wright lead is a false one Marcus pursues.\n- Unconventional\
    \ profiling: Yes, Marcus's focus on 'sanctuaries,' 'firsts,' and the city's hidden\
    \ geography is unconventional.\n- Ticking clock: Yes, the 72-hour countdown for\
    \ the first victim and the 48-hour countdown for Maya Torres.\n- Secondary character\
    \ betrayal: This is the only constraint not fully met. Walter is Marcus's friend\
    \ and helps him. Agent Hearn is his former supervisor and is initially skeptical\
    \ but ultimately helps him. There isn't a clear 'betrayal of trust' from a secondary\
    \ character.\n- Midpoint confrontation: Yes, the confrontation with Agent Hearn\
    \ where Marcus is taken off the case serves as a non-physical confrontation at\
    \ the midpoint.\n- Confront past failure: Yes, Marcus explicitly confronts his\
    \ failure regarding Elena multiple times, especially in his internal monologue\
    \ and dialogue with Walter and Sarah.\n\nBeat Execution:\n- Catalyst: Well executed\
    \ with the discovery of the first body and Marcus's immediate recognition of 'The\
    \ Rainmaker.'\n- Debate: The plan mentions a 'Debate' beat but doesn't provide\
    \ specific details for it. The output has Marcus debating with Walter about the\
    \ JohnDoe512 lead, which could count, but it's not as clearly defined as the other\
    \ beats in the plan.\n- Break into Two: The plan doesn't explicitly define 'Break\
    \ into Two' beyond the Catalyst. However, the sequence where Marcus pursues the\
    \ false lead and then the second body appears effectively serves as the break\
    \ into the main investigation.\n- Midpoint: The confrontation with Agent Hearn\
    \ where Marcus is taken off the case and then seeks out Sarah Oh functions well\
    \ as a midpoint, shifting Marcus's approach.\n\nNarrative Quality: The story is\
    \ engaging, with good pacing and a clear sense of Marcus's internal struggle.\
    \ The twist about the Rainmaker mirroring Marcus's obsession is interesting. The\
    \ dialogue is generally strong. The ending provides a sense of resolution for\
    \ Marcus's character arc."
