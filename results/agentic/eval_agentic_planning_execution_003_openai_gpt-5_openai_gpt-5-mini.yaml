  evidence: 'Plan completeness/specificity: The plan outlines a clear three-act, day-by-day
    structure with named scenes (notice, Mr. Alvarez, voicemail, reporter, final dinner,
    demolition) and includes the protagonist, daughter, and regular—addressing required
    beats. Plan adherence: The final output closely follows the plan—same scenes,
    characters, and arc (kimchi prep, Mr. Alvarez and his punch card, voicemail, Mina''s
    arrival and confrontation, final dinner, miyeok-guk, demolition, cautious move
    to California). Constraints satisfied (6/6): 1) Food used symbolically multiple
    times (kimchi, cutting board, dumplings, miyeok-guk, kimchi brine jar). 2) David''s
    grief for his wife is present implicitly (extra chair, soju poured, framed photo,
    rituals) without explicit statement. 3) Daughter''s estrangement has a specific
    cause—David stayed open when her mother was dying; she held her hand alone—clear
    and believable. 4) Regular customer Mr. Alvarez represents neighborhood memory/support
    (punch card, signatures, mailbox key). 5) Ending is hopeful but restrained (they
    decide to try California ''for a while'', demolition proceeds, he pockets the
    brine jar and steps forward). 6) Korean cultural elements beyond food appear (use
    of ''Appa'', bowing, jeong, Koreatown/shared kitchen mention, barley tea). Narrative
    quality: Strong sensory prose, steady pacing, emotional tension, and a bittersweet
    but credible resolution.'
