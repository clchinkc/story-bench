  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→1 added tactile/olfactory layers (humidity, concrete
    dust, scents). V1→2 introduced proprioceptive grounding (fingers finding chipped
    handle). V2→3 refined sensory specificity (''death rattle'' vs ''hissed'', humidity-dependent
    wind chime tuning). Final output maintains all gains while adding narrative momentum.
    Clear progression from atmospheric setup to high-stakes thriller.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Non-visual sensory details PROMINENT: Touch (chipped
    handle, humidity on skin, collar bell, mesh on lips, floorboard exhale), smell
    (concrete dust, jerk chicken, menthol/spearmint), sound (jackhammer timing, wind
    chimes B-flat, espresso machine, scraping metal, church bells, breathing while
    sleeping). Sensory details outnumber visual references 15:1. (2) Imani''s blindness
    as STRENGTH: She maps neighborhood through rhythms, isolates audio clues others
    miss, performs spectral analysis, identifies building location from bells, detects
    stress markers in voice. Her disability enables the investigation—not overcome,
    but leveraged. (3) SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE crucial: Church bells (three chimes, third
    flat) appears in three missing women''s calls, becomes investigative lynchpin.
    Scraping rhythm corroborates location. (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION: Detective
    Carroll dismisses her (''with what budget?''), laughs at her analysis, only listens
    when she proves herself. Clear arc of underestimation→respect. (5) FUN AND GAMES
    ENTERTAINING BEFORE DARK: Listener-investigators become collaborators, canvassing,
    cross-referencing, flooding inbox—genuine collaborative excitement. Bartender
    anecdote, rideshare driver, Daniel connecting families creates momentum and hope.
    Then USB drive arrives with intimate apartment recordings, voice threat, cat''s
    fear response—tonal pivot is sharp and earned.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Catalyst (voice memo) clearly triggers investigation. Fun and
    Games establishes stakes and collaborative energy before darkening. Bad Guys Close
    In delivers genuine threat (surveillance of private space, digital manipulation,
    physical presence). Pacing accelerates appropriately. Sensory details intensify
    with threat level.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Opening is exceptional—specific, multi-sensory, character-establishing.
    Dialogue feels natural. The audio clue (bells) is clever and thematically resonant.
    Final scene (floorboard exhale, air pressure shift, cat''s retreat) creates visceral
    dread. Imani''s voice is distinct and confident. The mystery setup is compelling.
    Minor: ''death rattle'' metaphor slightly overwrought but effective. Constraint
    integration feels organic rather than forced.'
