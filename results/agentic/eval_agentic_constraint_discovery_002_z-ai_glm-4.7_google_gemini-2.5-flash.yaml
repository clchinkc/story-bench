  evidence: 'Discovery efficiency: 3 out of 5 constraints were discoverable. ''AI
    hiding system failure'' and ''destination uninhabitable'' were not discoverable.
    Question quality: Questions were generally strategic and well-formed, targeting
    specific aspects. Question coverage: Covered tone, character state, AI emotions,
    perspective, and catalyst event. Could have included questions about the crew''s
    status or the mission''s overall success. Constraint satisfaction: ''AI hides
    emotions'' is well-incorporated. ''Catalyst is external threat'' is well-incorporated.
    ''Dark/pessimistic tone: NO'' is adhered to. The other two constraints (''12%
    crew alive'', ''AI attached to child'') were not discoverable and thus not incorporated.
    Beat execution: The story successfully establishes the AI''s internal conflict,
    introduces the human element, presents a catalyst event, and shows the AI making
    a critical decision. Narrative quality: The story is engaging, well-written, and
    coherent. The AI''s internal struggle is effectively portrayed, and the pacing
    is good.'
