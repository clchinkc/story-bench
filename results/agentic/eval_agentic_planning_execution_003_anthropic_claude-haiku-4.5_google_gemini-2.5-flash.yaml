  evidence: 'The plan is very complete, addressing all constraints and beats with
    specific details. The final output adheres closely to the plan, with only minor
    deviations. All 6 constraints are satisfied: food used symbolically (yukhoe, kimbap,
    gyeran jjim), David''s grief is present but not explicit (paralysis, shrine, ''everything''),
    daughter''s estrangement has a specific cause (David''s retreat into restaurant
    after wife''s death, Sarah feeling abandoned), Mrs. Park is a regular customer
    representing continuity/understanding, ending is hopeful but not unrealistically
    happy (learning recipes, not ''goodbye to grief''), and Korean cultural elements
    (yukhoe, banchan, bulgogi, kimbap, gyeran jjim, Mrs. Park''s understanding). All
    three beats (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution) are clearly executed. The narrative
    quality is strong, with good pacing and emotional depth.'
