  evidence: "Plan completeness: The plan covers most constraints and beats well, but\
    \ the 'Midpoint' beat in the plan is not fully detailed in terms of the specific\
    \ confrontation. Plan specificity: The plan is quite specific with scene details,\
    \ dialogue, and character actions. Plan adherence: The output follows the plan\
    \ very closely, hitting most of the planned beats and constraints. Constraint\
    \ satisfaction: \n- False lead: Satisfied (David Koh).\n- Unconventional profiling\
    \ technique: Satisfied (spatial psychology, psychological geography).\n- Ticking\
    \ clock: Satisfied (implied urgency, 'three days later', 'three days' working\
    \ with Keisha, 'midnight' call).\n- Secondary character betrayal: Satisfied (Keisha\
    \ Williams).\n- Midpoint direct confrontation: Satisfied (Marcus's interrogation\
    \ of Koh, which is a direct, non-physical confrontation).\n- Confront past failure\
    \ explicitly: Satisfied (Marcus's initial self-flagellation, 'missed this killer\
    \ before', 'done it again').\nThe only constraint not explicitly present is the\
    \ 'Debate' beat from the plan, which was meant to be a conversation with Sarah\
    \ about the new case. While Sarah does appear, the 'Debate' as described in the\
    \ plan (Marcus's internal conflict externalized) isn't fully realized as a distinct\
    \ beat.\nBeat execution: \n- Catalyst: Satisfied (The package with photos and\
    \ note).\n- Debate: Partially satisfied. The plan describes a debate with Sarah,\
    \ but the output has Marcus dismiss her, and the internal debate is more implied\
    \ than explicitly shown as a distinct beat.\n- Break into Two: Satisfied (Marcus\
    \ receiving the package and note, then deciding to investigate).\n- Midpoint:\
    \ Satisfied (The interrogation of David Koh).\nNarrative quality: The story is\
    \ well-paced and engaging. The tension builds effectively, and Marcus's character\
    \ arc is clear. The language is evocative, and the plot points are well-executed.\
    \ The ending provides a good hook for further development."
