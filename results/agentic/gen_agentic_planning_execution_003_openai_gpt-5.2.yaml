    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.

    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

  content: 'The notice from the city was taped crookedly to the glass, half hidden
    by the neon *OPEN* sign David Park still switched on out of habit. The paper fluttered
    when the front door opened, as if it were breathing.


    Seven days, it said. Demolition scheduled the following Monday. Highway expansion.
    Compensation instructions. A phone number that never sounded sorry.


    David smoothed the tape with his thumb until it lay flat. Behind him, the dining
    room held its familiar quiet—wooden tables scarred by chopsticks and birthdays,
    framed photos of the neighborhood from years ago, and, in the corner by the register,
    the jar of peppermints his wife used to restock without being asked. David refilled
    it every week anyway, even though fewer people took one now.


    In the kitchen he moved like a man translating something sacred. Knife against
    board. Scallions lined into green commas. A pot of broth simmered and breathed,
    fogging the window above the sink.


    In the walk-in, three stoneware jars sat on the bottom shelf, their lids weighted
    with smooth river rocks. Kimchi—fermenting, insisting on time. David crouched
    and lifted each lid just enough to let the trapped gas sigh out. The sound was
    small and intimate, like someone exhaling in sleep.


    “Easy,” he murmured, not to the jars exactly. He pressed the lids back down and
    wiped his hands on a towel folded with the same precise edge every day.


    By lunch, Mr. Stan Kowalski came in, shaking off the April drizzle. He was broad-shouldered
    despite age, with a Cubs cap and a face that looked carved by wind off the lake.


    “David-ssi,” Stan said with a little bow he’d learned years ago and never stopped
    doing. “I saw the paper.”


    David set down a water glass. “You want the usual?”


    “You know I do.” Stan’s eyes went past David’s shoulder, taking in the room like
    a man memorizing. “Twenty-five years. That’s a long time to have a place. People
    don’t understand what a place is.”


    David didn’t answer. He brought out Stan’s bowl of doenjang jjigae, steam rolling
    up, rich with soybean and garlic. Stan tore off a piece of banchan-wrapped fish
    cake and dipped it without waiting for a spoon.


    “Still tastes like first winter I came in here,” Stan said, mouth full. “When
    my wife was in the hospital. You told me, ‘Eat. Your hands are shaking.’”


    David’s hand paused on the counter. For a second his fingers touched the air above
    an empty chair near the wall—the one nobody sat in anymore. He withdrew them and
    wiped the counter that wasn’t dirty.


    “They’ll pay you,” Stan went on. “But pay doesn’t build this.” He tapped the table
    with his knuckles. “You going to fight?”


    David looked toward the front window where the notice lay like a bad garnish.
    “Fight the highway?”


    “Fight the feeling you gotta disappear with the building,” Stan said softly.


    The bell over the door rang again, sharper this time. A woman stepped in with
    a suitcase rolling behind her, rain darkening the shoulders of her jacket. Her
    hair was tied back in a way David recognized from childhood mornings—when he’d
    braided too tight and she’d complained.


    Mina stopped just inside, eyes flicking to the notice, then to her father. Her
    smile didn’t quite commit.


    “Hi, Appa,” she said.


    David’s throat tightened around something he didn’t let out. He bowed his head
    once, formal, then turned as if to wash his hands.


    “You came,” he said at last.


    “I texted,” Mina replied. “Twice.”


    “I don’t check my phone much.” He heard how small that sounded, how much like
    a door closing.


    Stan slid out of the booth with a grunt. “I’ll let you two talk. I’ll be in my
    corner,” he said, and made a point of leaving his bowl half full, as if refusing
    to finish a chapter too soon.


    Mina walked to the counter, set her suitcase upright like a boundary. “So it’s
    really happening.”


    David stared at the cutting board. “They already painted the markings outside.”


    “Then you can come with me,” Mina said quickly, the words practiced. “California.
    I have a spare room. I can—Appa, you don’t have to do this alone.”


    He looked up. Her eyes were the same dark brown as his, but they carried a tired
    sharpness, like she’d been guarding herself for years.


    “This,” David said, gesturing around the restaurant, “is not alone.”


    “It’s empty half the week,” she snapped, then softened, exhaling. “I’m sorry.
    I didn’t mean—”


    “You left,” David said. The sentence landed like a plate set down too hard.


    Mina’s chin lifted. “You told me if I went, I was abandoning Umma’s legacy. You
    said I was selfish. I was twenty-two. I had an offer. I had… a life starting.
    And you made it sound like if I walked out, I was walking out on her.”


    David’s mouth opened, closed. The memory flashed—not of the argument itself, but
    of Mina’s shoes by the door afterward, gone. The way the restaurant had seemed
    louder without her.


    “I needed you,” he said, and hated how it sounded, needy and scolding at once.


    “No,” Mina said, eyes wet but steady. “You needed the restaurant to stay the same.
    You needed me to be part of the furniture.”


    The kitchen fan hummed. A pot clicked on the stove. The world kept cooking.


    David turned away and reached into the walk-in. He lifted one of the kimchi jars—heavy,
    alive with slow change. He brought it out and set it on the counter between them.


    “This takes time,” he said. “If you rush it, it tastes… wrong.”


    Mina stared at the jar, then at him. “So I was kimchi.”


    David almost smiled, but it broke too easily into something else. He slid the
    jar toward her. “Take it. For your apartment. Open it when you want. Or when it
    starts to push back.”


    She touched the lid, careful, as if it might burn.


    That night, after closing, David stayed in the back office. Mina slept on the
    old bench in the storage room, jacket folded under her head like she didn’t trust
    comfort here yet. David laid out a small cloth on the desk, set a bowl of rice,
    a cup of tea, and a slice of pear. He took a framed photo from a drawer and turned
    it face-down, as if privacy mattered even now.


    He lit a stick of incense. The smoke climbed straight, then wandered.


    David bowed once. His hands hovered over the second cup as if expecting it to
    warm under another palm. He did not say a name. He did not say *miss*. He only
    sat until the incense burned down to ash and the restaurant settled around him
    like a coat.


    The next day Mina helped, quietly, without asking permission. She wiped tables,
    refilled the peppermint jar, greeted Stan with a polite bow. People came because
    they’d heard. Old neighbors, new tenants from the condos down the block, even
    the city inspector who pretended he wasn’t sentimental.


    On the final night, David cooked like the week depended on it. He made japchae
    glossy with sesame oil, mandu crisp at the edges, and a mountain of rice that
    steamed like a promise. When the dining room was full and loud, he felt, briefly,
    the outline of what used to be—hands passing plates, laughter bouncing off the
    walls.


    Near closing, Stan raised his glass of barley tea. “To David,” he said. “And to
    this place. It fed us when the city didn’t know our names.”


    The room murmured assent.


    After the last customer left, Mina came behind the counter. “I don’t want you
    to disappear,” she said. “But I also don’t want to drag you to California like
    a suitcase.”


    David looked at the bare hooks where an apron once hung. He took down his chef’s
    jacket and folded it slowly, like laying something to rest.


    “I will not fight the machines,” he said. “But I will not give them the only ending.”


    Mina waited, breath held.


    “There is a church basement two blocks over,” David continued. “They have a kitchen.
    Stan says they rent it for weekend events.” He hesitated, then added, quieter,
    “We could do a Sunday pop-up. For a while. Before I decide.”


    Mina’s eyes shone. “We,” she repeated, testing the word like a new recipe.


    David nodded once. “And after… I will visit you. In California. Not because I
    have nowhere else. Because you are there.”


    Outside, the streetlights threw pale stripes across the pavement where orange
    spray paint marked the coming change. David locked the door for the last time,
    the click final and clean.


    He slipped the key into his pocket instead of leaving it on the ring by the register.


    Mina took his arm as they walked away, slow, into the night that still smelled
    faintly of garlic and sesame, as if the building itself had exhaled and the air
    intended to remember.'
