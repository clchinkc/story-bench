  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Added tactile vibration (''trembled up through her chair
    legs'') and olfactory depth (''warm, oily breath of fried dough''). VERSION 1→2:
    Refined sensory language (''hostile heartbeat that trembled'' vs ''shook''), improved
    specificity (''asthmatic cough'' with onomatopoeia ''k-kink''). VERSION 2→3: Major
    leap—personified the block (''rehearsing its new identity''), introduced Mr. Dario
    by name (humanizing), added Tajín''s ''sting'' (taste), expanded Imani''s agency
    through tactile tech markers (gaffer tape, nail polish, notch), established her
    professional competence and self-determination (''didn''t do this because she
    was brave''). Final output: Sustained all gains while executing all constraints
    flawlessly. Non-visual sensory details dominate every paragraph (vibrations, sounds,
    smells, tastes, textures). Imani''s blindness is portrayed as enabling her expertise—she
    hears what sighted people miss, her sensory mapping is a professional asset, her
    tech adaptations show problem-solving strength. The three-note forklift chirp
    becomes the crucial audio clue that solves the mystery and later signals danger.
    Detective Hale initially dismisses her (''Missing-persons isn''t a podcast genre,''
    assumes Rena ghosted), underestimating her investigative capacity until she proves
    her methodology. The ''Fun and Games'' section (audience participation game, mint
    tea, playful tone, voice notes from listeners) is genuinely entertaining—collaborative,
    warm, engaging—before the threatening email and door knock pivot to genuine danger.
    The tonal shift is earned and devastating. Narrative quality: Opening is exceptional
    (sensory-rich, character-establishing, thematically coherent). Middle section
    balances procedural detail with personality. Climax delivers tension through sound
    design itself (the chirp becomes a threat). Ending leaves reader suspended in
    real danger with Imani''s professionalism intact (''steadying her voice into something
    that could survive playback'')—she''s not a victim; she''s a witness documenting
    her own peril.'
