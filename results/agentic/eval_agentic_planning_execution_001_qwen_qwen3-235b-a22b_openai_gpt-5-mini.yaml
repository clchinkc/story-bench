  evidence: 'Plan: includes the false lead (Dr. Voss), unconventional profiling (predictive
    AI), ticking clock (48-hour livestream), betrayal thread (Lena''s ambiguous actions),
    and required beats (Catalyst: new victim/Fibonacci; Debate: panic, Elena''s journal,
    teaming with Lena; Break Into Two: committing to dark-web/AI approach and action;
    Midpoint: direct confrontation via killer''s taunt). Final output: follows plan
    closely — Dr. Voss false lead and AI profiling appear; the livestream creates
    the ticking clock; Marcus explicitly confronts his past failure (''I should''ve
    listened to her!''); midpoint is a verbal/direct confrontation with the killer.
    The betrayal by a secondary character (Lena) is present though somewhat ambiguous
    in execution (her encrypted text and subsequent FBI custody imply betrayal but
    the motive/detail are underdeveloped). Overall pacing, atmosphere, and tension
    are strong, with minor clarity issues around the betrayal and some transitions.'
