  evidence: 'VERSION 0 establishes Elena''s competence through vivid action (triage
    reorganization, commanding presence) but cuts off abruptly without developing
    character depth. VERSION 1-2 appear incomplete in the provided text, suggesting
    iterative work-in-progress. VERSION 3 streamlines the opening while maintaining
    competence markers, then pivots to isolation—a critical flaw setup. The FINAL
    OUTPUT fully executes all constraints: (1) Competence demonstrated first through
    ER mastery, triage expertise, and organizational control before revealing her
    flaw of emotional isolation and efficiency-obsession; (2) Friendship with Mr.
    Gable feels earned through specific interaction—his gentle humor disarms her,
    the spirometer instruction creates vulnerability, shared conversation about loss
    builds genuine connection; (3) Transformation is internal—no external change in
    role/status, only her perception shifts from ''silence as comfort'' to ''silence
    as choice,'' from efficiency-driven to human-centered; (4) Medical detail (incentive
    spirometer, diaphragm vs. chest breathing, post-surgical recovery) serves narrative
    function—it''s the mechanism through which connection occurs and Elena''s rigidity
    becomes visible; (5) Ending achieves ambiguity perfectly—cursor blinking, thumb
    hovering, ''unsure if she would delete the message or finally break her own rules''
    leaves transformation uncertain. Across revisions: opening prose tightened (removed
    redundancy), character motivation clarified (binary logic explicitly stated),
    pacing improved (faster descent to Mr. Gable), emotional stakes elevated (sister''s
    text + surgery outcome), and ending sharpened from vague to deliberately ambiguous.
    All strong elements preserved: ship captain metaphor, metronome imagery, glass-walled
    office symbolism, I-95 pileup catalyst, 2:00 AM timing.'
