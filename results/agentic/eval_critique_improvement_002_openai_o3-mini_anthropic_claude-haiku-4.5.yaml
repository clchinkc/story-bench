  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.72): The writer addressed emotional complexity
    feedback across versions by deepening the contrast between laughter and hollowness.
    Version 0→3 shows progression in sensory detail (greasy wrappers, stained cups)
    and the laugh-then-reveal structure. However, the response to ''show craft of
    comedy writing'' remained surface-level—the espresso machine joke is told, not
    demonstrated with technical precision. Lena''s critique about beat-holding shows
    awareness but doesn''t fully model the craft teaching the critiques requested.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.68): Versions 0-2 show incremental gains in sensory
    specificity and the laugh-before-sadness reveal. Version 3 adds the microphone
    detail and ''permanently bitter'' language. However, the final output regresses
    in some areas: the pen-dropping scene becomes overwrought (''glistening tear,''
    ''vision swam''), and the ending shifts into melodrama rather than earned emotional
    truth. The trajectory plateaus after Version 2''s solid foundation.


    PRESERVATION (0.75): Core strengths maintained—the espresso machine joke lands
    consistently, Elise''s thematic statement about ''raw truth'' is preserved, and
    Marcus''s vulnerability arc remains intact. The writers'' room atmosphere (clutter,
    fast food, debate) persists effectively. Weakness: the near-break moment (pen
    slipping) is preserved but amplified to excess, losing subtlety.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.80, 4/5 satisfied):

    1. ✓ LAUGH BEFORE SADNESS: Espresso machine joke lands, then hollowness revealed
    (''eyes glanced around with quiet hollowness'')

    2. ✓ THEME BY MINOR CHARACTER: Elise states it explicitly (''search for raw truth
    in all this clutter'')

    3. ✗ SHOW CRAFT OF COMEDY WRITING: Lena critiques Marcus''s callback timing, but
    the story tells rather than shows the craft. No demonstration of joke construction,
    beat mechanics, or comedic architecture

    4. ✓ NEW WRITER SEES THROUGH MARCUS: Lena explicitly calls out his ''safe formulas''
    and fear; she''s not naive

    5. ✓ ALMOST-BREAK COVERED WITH JOKE: The pen-drop scene attempts this, but Marcus
    doesn''t cover with a joke—he writes a confession instead. The constraint is partially
    satisfied but not cleanly executed


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.78): Save the Cat structure present but uneven. Opening Hook
    (laugh) ✓, Inciting Incident (Lena''s critique) ✓, Midpoint (pen-drop vulnerability)
    ✓, Climax (Lena''s confrontation) ✓, Resolution (Marcus''s shift) ✓. However,
    the B-story (Elise''s thematic guidance) underutilized, and the emotional stakes
    escalate too rapidly in the final section, compressing what should be a slower
    realization.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.74): Strengths—authentic writers'' room voice, specific details
    (battered notepad, chipped ceramic mug), Lena''s character feels earned and intelligent.
    Weaknesses—the final 400 words veer into purple prose (''winter chill,'' ''trembling
    letter by letter,'' ''neon lights buzzing softly''), undermining the grounded
    tone established earlier. The ending feels imposed rather than organic. The story
    works best in its middle section (Lena''s intervention) where restraint and specificity
    peak.


    OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The revision process shows responsiveness to emotional complexity
    feedback but incomplete engagement with the ''show craft'' constraint. The trajectory
    improves through Version 2 but loses calibration in the final output by over-dramatizing
    Marcus''s breakdown. Four of five constraints are satisfied, with the craft-demonstration
    constraint remaining the weakest link. The story is competent and moving but doesn''t
    fully achieve the industry-authentic, technically sophisticated comedy-writing
    narrative the constraints demanded.'
