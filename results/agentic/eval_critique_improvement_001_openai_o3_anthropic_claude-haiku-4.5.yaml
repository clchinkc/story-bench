  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: The final output demonstrates exceptional execution of methodical
    characterization through action (footfall counting, evidence cataloging, ritual
    precision). Fog serves dual narrative purposes: concealment for smuggling operations
    AND psychological trigger for Sarah''s past trauma. Three required beats are clearly
    marked and executed: Inciting Incident (body discovery), First Plot Point (Charlie''s
    nervous tell + unasked ferry comment), and Decision Moment (Sarah advancing toward
    confrontation). Charlie Keene''s secret (smuggling operation, missing diesel ledgers,
    Persephone trawler connection) is well-integrated. Sarah''s Boston case is effectively
    hinted at early (''night everything shattered,'' unfinished recognition) before
    revelation in the evidence room. The ending commits to decision rather than resolution—Sarah
    steps into fog toward reckoning, not toward answers.


    WEAKNESSES: Constraint #5 (end on decision, not resolution) is marginally satisfied
    but slightly undercut by the final paragraph''s explanatory framing (''Missing
    diesel on harbor ledgers...Answers waited between...'') which reads as partial
    resolution/exposition rather than pure decision moment. The narrative would be
    stronger ending at ''counting five measured breaths before advancing'' without
    the subsequent explanation. Critique responsiveness is moderate—the three critiques
    were highly similar (all scoring 0.82-0.88) and the revisions show minimal textual
    changes, suggesting limited iterative improvement. The trajectory plateaued rather
    than demonstrating clear progression. Preservation is strong because the core
    opening remained intact across versions, maintaining the excellent methodical
    voice established in VERSION 0.


    PROCESS ISSUE: Versions 1-3 appear nearly identical to VERSION 0, indicating either
    minimal revision or incomplete documentation of changes. This limits assessment
    of how critique feedback was actually incorporated into successive drafts. The
    final output does address critique points comprehensively, but the revision process
    itself lacks demonstrable iteration.'
