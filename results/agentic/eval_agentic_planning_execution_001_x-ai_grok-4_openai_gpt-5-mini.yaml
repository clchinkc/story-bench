  evidence: 'All six required constraints are present in the final output: the false
    lead (Elias Grant) is pursued, Marcus uses an unconventional ''echo mapping''
    profiling technique, a ticking clock (72-hour storm) is established, Detective
    Riley betrays Marcus by leaking his leads to Agent Voss, the Midpoint is a verbal/direct
    confrontation at the waterfront warehouse, and Marcus explicitly confronts his
    past failure (Sarah''s death). Required beats (Catalyst: the anonymous photo/news;
    Debate: Marcus weighing whether to pursue and calling Voss; Break into Two: Marcus
    goes rogue and uses echo mapping to pursue Elias; Midpoint: the non-physical standoff)
    are all executed. Ratings reflect high completeness and adherence, with minor
    deductions for plan_specificity (some later-act details and motivations could
    be deeper) and plan_adherence (small differences in phrasing and emphasis between
    plan and excerpt). Narrative quality is strong—good atmosphere, pacing, and tension—though
    betrayal and Elias''s false-lead motivation could be expanded for greater emotional
    payoff.'
