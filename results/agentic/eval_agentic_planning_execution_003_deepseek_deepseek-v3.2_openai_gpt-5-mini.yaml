  evidence: 'Plan: clearly identifies three-act structure, characters, specific foods
    (yukgaejang, songpyeon), jesa, Mrs. Henderson, and a believable estrangement cause
    (modernization vs. tradition). Final output: follows plan closely — includes demolition
    notice (Act 1 setup), Elena''s arrival and kitchen conflict/touring spaces (confrontation/midpoint),
    and the jesa/songpyeon scene leading to a realistic hopeful resolution (Act 3).
    All six constraints satisfied: food symbolism appears multiple times, grief for
    Mina is present implicitly (rituals, reserved bowl, photos), estrangement cause
    is explicit and believable, Mrs. Henderson represents continuity, jesa is used
    as a Korean cultural element beyond food, and ending is hopeful but restrained.
    Writing is evocative, well-paced, and maintains tension; minor scope for deeper
    interiority but overall strong adherence.'
