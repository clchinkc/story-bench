  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Only 2 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q1-Q4 effectively ruled out certain constraint types
    (physical force, magical blight, people/spirit corruption), but the questions
    never directly probed for: mentor death, protagonist''s father''s history, time
    limits, or the ancestral sword reforging requirement. The apprentice''s hidden
    talent (Cinderblood lineage) was successfully discovered through Q2-Q3, and the
    non-magical nature of the darkness was confirmed. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions
    were logically structured and eliminated possibilities systematically, but lacked
    specificity about key story elements (mentor role, family history, temporal pressure,
    artifact requirements). QUESTION COVERAGE: Questions focused heavily on the nature
    of darkness (Q1, Q4, Q5) with only one question about the protagonist''s abilities.
    No questions addressed mentor, family legacy, time pressure, or magical artifacts.
    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: The narrative incorporates the protagonist''s hidden
    talent (Cinderblood ability) and the non-magical darkness concept well. However,
    it FAILS to include: (1) mentor death during ordeal—Borin remains alive and sends
    her off; (2) three-day time limit—no temporal pressure mentioned; (3) father''s
    failed heroism—no paternal backstory; (4) reforging ancestral sword—the story
    features a hammer and locket, not a broken sword. BEAT EXECUTION: The Ordeal beat
    is present and emotionally resonant, but lacks the mentor''s sacrifice and the
    specific artifact (ancestral sword) that should anchor the victory. The story
    resolves the darkness but misses critical structural beats. NARRATIVE QUALITY:
    Excellent prose, strong atmospheric worldbuilding, clear character arc, and satisfying
    emotional payoff. The Cinderblood concept is well-integrated and the forge metaphor
    is thematically coherent. However, narrative excellence cannot compensate for
    missing core constraints.'
