    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Save the Cat

    - Protagonist: Imani Torres, a blind podcaster who hosts a true crime show from
    her

    apartment. Sharp-witted and observant in ways sighted people miss,

    she compensates with exceptional audio memory and pattern recognition.


    - Setting: A gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhood during a humid summer. The sounds

    of construction, street vendors, and distant sirens form Imani''s world.


    - Required beats: Opening Image, Catalyst, Fun and Games, Bad Guys Close In


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must use non-visual sensory details prominently

    - Imani''s blindness must be portrayed respectfully and as a strength

    - Include a specific audio clue that becomes crucial

    - One character must initially underestimate Imani

    - The ''Fun and Games'' must genuinely entertain before turning dark


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-650 words

    **Opening Image**


    Imani''s fingers danced across her braille display as the waveform of Episode
    47 pulsed through her headphones. The metallic scrape of Mr. Chen''s produce cart—always
    at 2:47 PM, always hitting that same cracked sidewalk piece—provided her usual
    time check. She smiled. People thought blindness meant missing things. They had
    no idea how much sighted people failed to hear.


    "The husband''s alibi," she narrated into her microphone, "hinged on a dog barking
    in the background of his call. But listeners, did you catch what I caught?"


    Her phone buzzed. Unknown number.


    **Catalyst**


    "Ms. Torres? Detective Ramirez. We''re fans of your podcast." His voice carried
    that patronizing lilt people used when they thought they were being kind. "We''ve
    got a situation. Woman reported missing in your building—3B. Boyfriend says she
    left at 9 AM yesterday, but the neighbor''s not buying it."


    "And you''re calling a podcaster because...?"


    "You''ve got good instincts for this stuff. Thought you might''ve heard something.
    Just audio files, nothing dangerous."


    Nothing dangerous. Right. Because blind women needed protecting.


    "Send them over."


    **Fun and Games**


    The boyfriend''s voice recording arrived within minutes. Imani imported it, cranked
    the volume, and leaned back.


    "I made her breakfast, she kissed me goodbye, said she was meeting friends at
    the park..."


    Underneath his words: the distinctive beep-beep-beep of a reversing truck. Imani
    grinned. This was the puzzle she lived for.


    She opened her window. The construction site two blocks over had been doing foundation
    work—those backup beeps echoed through the neighborhood like clockwork. She''d
    been documenting it for weeks, complaining about the noise in her building''s
    group chat.


    She pulled up her audio journal. July 8th, 9 AM: backup beeps started. July 9th—yesterday:
    silent. The crew had finished that section.


    Her phone became an extension of her mind. She called Mr. Chen.


    "The vegetable truck yesterday morning—what time?"


    "Same as always, Imani. Eight-thirty."


    She called her downstairs neighbor, Mrs. Rodriguez.


    "Did you hear the couple in 3B fighting yesterday?"


    "After midnight, sí. Terrible shouting. Then quiet. Too quiet."


    The pieces clicked together like beats in a track. The boyfriend''s recording
    was from Tuesday, not Wednesday. He''d doctored the timeline.


    **Bad Guys Close In**


    Imani sent her findings to Ramirez. His response came fast: "Stay where you are."


    But her door was already opening.


    She heard him before she smelled him—the boyfriend from 3B. His breathing was
    wrong, rapid and shallow. The cheap cologne couldn''t quite mask the chemical
    odor. Bleach. Lots of it.


    "You couldn''t just mind your business," he whispered.


    Imani''s hand found her phone, finger already on the emergency call button she''d
    positioned by muscle memory. But she needed him talking, on record.


    "The backup beeps gave you away," she said calmly, hitting record on her editing
    software. "You''re not as careful as you think."


    His footsteps moved closer.


    She''d always known her ears might save her life someday. Just not like this.'

    Imani''s fingers traced the braille display as Episode 47''s waveform pulsed through
    her headphones. Outside, humid air pressed through her window screen, carrying
    the metallic scrape of Mr. Chen''s produce cart—always 2:47 PM, always catching
    on that cracked sidewalk piece. She smiled at the precision of it. The city was
    full of patterns if you knew how to listen.


    "The husband''s alibi," she narrated into her microphone, "hinged on a dog barking
    in the background. But listeners—did you catch the ice cream truck playing ''Turkey
    in the Straw'' at the exact same moment? In January?"


    Her phone vibrated against the desk''s wood grain. Unknown number.


    **Catalyst**


    "Ms. Torres? Detective Ramirez." His voice had that careful enunciation people
    used when they thought you needed extra help. "Big fans of your podcast. Listen,
    we''ve got a situation—missing woman in your building, 3B. Boyfriend claims she
    left yesterday at 9 AM. We''ve got his statement on tape. I thought, with your
    ear for detail..."


    "You want me to listen to an audio file."


    "If you''re comfortable. Nothing risky, just—"


    "Detective, I solve murders for a living. Send it."


    The silence on his end felt satisfying.


    **Fun and Games**


    The recording arrived warm with compression artifacts. Imani imported it, fingers
    flying across her keyboard, and leaned into the sound.


    "I made her breakfast," the boyfriend said. "Eggs, toast. She kissed me goodbye
    around nine, said she was meeting friends at Prospect Park..."


    There—beneath his words—the rhythmic beep-beep-beep of a reversing truck.


    Imani''s pulse quickened. This was the game she loved.


    She queried her audio journal, weeks of ambient recordings she kept for her podcast''s
    Brooklyn soundscape segments. The construction crew two blocks over had been backing
    cement mixers into her mornings like clockwork. July 8th, 9 AM: backup beeps,
    jackhammer, someone''s radio playing reggaeton. July 9th—yesterday morning: blessed
    silence. They''d moved to a different site.


    She grabbed her phone, already grinning.


    Mr. Chen confirmed his vegetable truck arrived at eight-thirty yesterday, same
    as always. Mrs. Rodriguez downstairs remembered shouting from 3B after midnight
    Tuesday—then nothing. No footsteps leaving at nine. No door closing.


    The boyfriend had used Tuesday''s recording, tried to pass it off as Wednesday.


    **Bad Guys Close In**


    Imani was typing her findings to Ramirez when she heard it: footsteps in the hallway,
    stopping at her door. The floorboard outside 4C always creaked—except when someone
    was trying to be quiet.


    Her door lock clicked. She''d forgotten to engage the deadbolt.


    The chemical burn of bleach hit her nose first, then his cologne—the boyfriend
    from 3B. His breathing came shallow and quick, fabric rustling as he moved closer.


    "Couldn''t leave it alone," he whispered.


    Imani''s hand found her phone, muscle memory guiding her to the emergency call
    position. But she needed time, needed evidence.


    "The backup beeps," she said, keeping her voice steady, hitting record on her
    editing software. "You used the wrong day''s audio. Sloppy."


    "You''re the one who was sloppy." His footsteps crossed her threshold. "Coming
    after me when you can''t even see me coming."


    "That''s where you''re wrong," Imani said, and pressed SEND.'

    Imani''s fingers traced the braille display while Episode 47''s waveform pulsed
    through her headphones. July heat pressed through the window screen like a wet
    towel, carrying sweat, exhaust, and the metallic scrape of Mr. Chen''s produce
    cart—2:47 PM, right on schedule, catching that same crack in the sidewalk. She''d
    asked the city to fix it twice. They never listened.


    "The husband''s alibi hinged on a dog barking in the background," she narrated.
    "But did you catch the ice cream truck playing ''Turkey in the Straw''? In January?"
    She grinned. "Come on, people. Use your ears."


    Her phone vibrated against the desk. Unknown number. Probably another Reddit sleuth
    with a "tip."


    **Catalyst**


    "Ms. Torres? Detective Ramirez, 78th Precinct." That careful pronunciation again.
    "We''re fans. Listen, there''s a situation in your building—woman missing from
    3B. Boyfriend says she left yesterday morning. Got his statement recorded. Thought
    maybe you could—"


    "You want me to fact-check alibis now?" Imani laughed. "What happened to actual
    police work?"


    "You''re good at this. Better than good. And you''re right there."


    She sighed. The flattery was obvious, but hell—it was too hot to go outside anyway.
    "Send it."


    **Fun and Games**


    The boyfriend''s voice came through tinny, rehearsed. Too rehearsed.


    "Made her breakfast. Eggs, toast. She left around nine, meeting friends at Prospect
    Park..."


    Imani caught it immediately—that distinctive beep-beep-beep underneath. Construction
    backup alarms, the soundtrack of gentrification.


    She pulled up her audio archive, the ambient tracks she recorded for atmosphere.
    Most podcasters used stock sounds. Imani refused—Brooklyn had its own rhythm.
    July 8th, 9 AM: backup beeps, jackhammer percussion, someone''s radio bleeding
    Bad Bunny. July 9th, yesterday: nothing. The crew had moved sites.


    She called Mr. Chen first. "Your Tuesday morning delivery—what time?"


    "Eight-thirty, same always. Why, you buying vegetables now?"


    "Thinking about it." She wasn''t. "Mrs. Rodriguez?"


    Her downstairs neighbor picked up on the first ring. "Imani! You hear them fighting
    Tuesday night? Madre de Dios, the screaming."


    "What time?"


    "After midnight. Then nothing Wednesday morning. Usually she slams the door at
    eight, clip-clip-clip in those heels. Yesterday? Silence."


    Imani leaned back, smiling. The boyfriend had pre-recorded his alibi on Tuesday,
    probably right after the fight, before he''d done whatever he''d done. Amateur
    hour.


    **Bad Guys Close In**


    She was emailing Ramirez when she heard the hallway creak—the board outside 4C
    that always groaned, except now it whispered. Someone walking carefully.


    Her apartment door clicked. She''d forgotten the deadbolt. Damn this heat making
    her sloppy.


    Bleach fumes invaded first, sharp enough to sting. Then his cologne, cheap and
    cloying. The boyfriend''s breathing came shallow, panicked.


    "You should''ve minded your business."


    Imani''s hand found her phone—emergency button positioned exactly three inches
    from her keyboard''s right edge. But she needed him talking. Evidence.


    "The backup beeps gave you away," she said, voice steady despite her hammering
    heart. "You recorded your alibi Tuesday, didn''t you? Before you killed her."


    "Clever." His footsteps moved closer. Hardwood, then area rug. Five feet away.
    "But what good is clever when you can''t see what''s coming?"


    Imani pressed record on her editing software. "You''d be surprised what I see."


    She hit SEND on the email to Ramirez, police precinct address, subject line: 3B
    SUSPECT IN MY APARTMENT NOW.


    And waited for the sirens.'

    Imani''s fingers traced the braille display while Episode 47''s waveform pulsed
    through her headphones. July humidity made the keys sticky, carrying the stink
    of hot garbage mixed with halal cart lamb. Below, Mr. Chen''s produce cart scraped
    metal-on-concrete—2:47 PM exactly, hitting that broken sidewalk seam that rang
    like a tuning fork.


    "The husband''s alibi? Dog barking on his phone call," she narrated into her mic.
    "Cute. Except that same dog barked in the exact rhythm of ''Jingle Bells.'' In
    July. His neighbor''s ringtone, playing through the wall."

    courtesy?"

    he could definitely hear. "But I''m bored. Send it."

    nine for Prospect Park..."


    There. Underneath his performance: beep-beep-beep. Construction backup alarm,
    that particular pitch that meant cement mixer, not dump truck.


    Imani pulled up her audio library—Brooklyn''s daily symphony, catalogued by date
    and time. July 8th, 9 AM: backup beep (cement), jackhammer rattle, radio playing
    Daddy Yankee. July 9th, yesterday: silence. The crew had relocated.

    "Same since 1997. Eight-thirty."

    Bleach hit her sinuses first, chemical-sharp. Then his cologne, something trying

    "Couldn''t let it go, could you."


    Not a question. Imani''s hand found her phone—three inches right of her keyboard,
    always. Emergency call queued. But she needed him recorded, talking.
