  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Shifted from nighttime exposition to daytime inciting incident,
    introduced concrete stakes (diabetes meds), replaced passive observation with
    active internal conflict (fingers drumming register, the lie). VERSION 1→3: Deepened
    grandmother scene with visceral physicality (hands shaking, grip like vice, knuckles
    as desert pebbles), added Mrs. Ruiz as the genuine adult confidant who understands
    without judgment, replaced abstract emotional language with sensory details (chile
    dust, queso fresco, rusted screen door breathing). FINAL OUTPUT: Successfully
    executes all constraints—(1) Internal conflict shown through action (avoiding
    gaze, clutching tamale, the lie to Javier) rather than exposition; (2) Grandmother
    moment crystallizes choice through ''*Vete*'' command paired with tamale gift,
    layered with shared history (masa-kneading, graduation tears); (3) Mrs. Ruiz genuinely
    understands Mateo''s dilemma without solving it (''Desert blooms when you stop
    pulling weeds''), offering wisdom rooted in her own loss; (4) Cultural elements
    feel lived-in (prickly pear jam, masa, Spanish code-switching, jade necklace tied
    to his mother''s legacy, not generic); (5) Resolution earned through Mateo''s
    growth—abuela''s independence (unopened meds, nurse steadying her) and his earned
    freedom (canyon edge, river metaphor) show mutual maturation. Beat execution strong:
    exposition establishes stakes clearly, rising action builds tension through competing
    loyalties, climax delivers the blessing as permission rather than release, falling
    action shows no guilt/only relief, resolution mirrors emotional arc with river-as-promise
    imagery. Minor weakness: Mrs. Ruiz''s metaphor (''Desert blooms'') could feel
    slightly more grounded in specific moment rather than delivered wisdom, and the
    final text exchange feels slightly rushed. Overall trajectory demonstrates clear
    refinement in showing vs. telling, specificity, and earned emotional resonance.'
