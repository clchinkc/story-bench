  evidence: 'From V0→V3 the draft preserved its sharp comic images (''Charge you by
    the kiloton'', ''Red Vines like antidepressants'') while adding purposeful emotional
    scaffolding and craft detail. Harper''s voice and savvy were strengthened (no
    longer naïve), the minor-character theme line (Ravi: ''boat wants to sink'') was
    made explicit, and the near-break moment (vending-machine/Red Vines) plus the
    closing authentic laugh were added or deepened. Network notes, emails, and specific
    joke-craft talk (the pause as the laugh, marker/whiteboard beats, hybridizing
    pitches) were expanded to make the writers'' room feel real and to show the mechanics
    of comedy writing. Overall the revisions shifted the piece from primarily quippy
    to a more balanced, emotionally resonant scene while preserving the story''s funniest
    images.'
