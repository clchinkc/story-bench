  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece tightened and focused: early drafts relied
    more on exposition, later versions replaced telling with specific, methodical
    actions (measuring footprints with a steel ruler, photographing under the ruler''s
    edge, using tweezers, noting lividity). The fog was upgraded from atmosphere to
    plot device (visibility collapse, smothering radio signals, hiding silhouettes).
    Eli''s secret is established through physical clues (fresh scratches, motor oil
    scent) rather than blunt statement. The ending was adjusted to a clear decision
    point (finger over the dead radio channel) rather than resolution. Preservation:
    the story kept its procedural voice and tactile details while removing some overt
    exposition. Remaining weakness: the requirement that Sarah''s past case be hinted
    at before being revealed is weakly handled — the text mostly reveals the Baltimore
    connection at the moment of seeing the tattoo; only indirect, emotional cues precede
    it rather than a clear, earlier hint. This is why one of five constraints is marked
    unsatisfied despite strong overall execution.'
