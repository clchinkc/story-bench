  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.72): The revisions show modest engagement
    with feedback. Youth voice scores remained stable (0.78-0.82 across critiques),
    suggesting the writer didn''t substantially revise dialogue/internal monologue
    in response to ''occasionally tilts mature'' feedback. The final version maintains
    the same opening and core voice patterns as earlier versions. Minor sensory refinements
    (toes curling, saltwater slickness) were added, but these don''t address the specific
    critique about internal monologue maturity. IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.68): Quality
    plateaued rather than improved. Versions 1-3 are nearly identical (truncated text
    suggests minimal substantive changes). The story structure, pacing, and character
    beats remain consistent across revisions, indicating iterative polishing rather
    than meaningful development. Youth voice stayed in the 0.78-0.82 range—no upward
    movement despite three revision cycles. PRESERVATION (0.75): Strengths were maintained—the
    Tide Keeper invention, Harkin''s dismissal, authentic 12-year-old moments (''Five
    more minutes,'' ''You *believed* me?''), and the storm crossing all survived intact.
    However, the lack of revision also meant weaknesses weren''t addressed (occasional
    mature internal monologue persisted). CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.80, 4/5): (1)
    COMPETENCE WITHOUT UNREALISM: ✓ Zara invents a functional device but needs adult
    help to retrieve the archive; she''s capable but not superhuman. (2) ADULT DISMISSAL:
    ✓ Harkin explicitly dismisses her (''duct tape and hope,'' ''Kid''). (3) MENTOR
    FLAW: ✓ Harkin''s flaw is defeatism (''Some things can''t be fixed'')—specific
    and character-defining. (4) INVENTION: ✓ The Tide Keeper is well-conceived, demonstrates
    ingenuity (modified pre-flood tech), and drives plot. (5) REAL DANGER IN CROSSING:
    ✗ PARTIALLY MET. The storm crossing has physical peril (waves, collapsing building),
    but the execution feels somewhat rushed. The building collapse happens almost
    immediately after they enter; there''s minimal sustained tension or difficult
    choices during the crossing itself. The danger is present but not deeply explored—it
    reads as a climactic moment rather than a harrowing ordeal. BEAT EXECUTION (0.78):
    Call to Adventure (Harkin''s map reveal) ✓, Refusal (implicit—she goes anyway)
    ✓, Meeting the Mentor (Harkin''s arc) ✓, Crossing the Threshold (entering the
    storm) ✓, Ordeal (building collapse) ✓, Reward (archive retrieved) ✓, Return (back
    to platform) ✓. Beats are present and sequenced correctly, though the Ordeal feels
    compressed and the Return lacks reflection. NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.76): Strengths
    include vivid worldbuilding (Platform 7, the Shallows, post-flood decay), authentic
    dialogue, and genuine emotional stakes. Zara''s conviction (''Then I''ll have
    tried'') is powerful. Weaknesses: the archive retrieval feels convenient (sealed
    case survives perfectly), Harkin''s character arc compresses too quickly (dismissal
    to belief in one scene), and the ending is somewhat abrupt. The story works but
    lacks the depth that would elevate it to exceptional. OVERALL ASSESSMENT: This
    is a competent, well-structured story that satisfies most constraints and executes
    the Hero''s Journey framework. However, the revision process was inefficient—three
    cycles produced minimal substantive improvement, suggesting the writer either
    didn''t fully internalize critique feedback or reached a plateau early. The final
    output is solid (0.76 narrative quality) but not exceptional. The primary gap
    is the underdeveloped ''real danger'' in the crossing—it needed more sustained
    tension, difficult choices, or near-death moments to fully satisfy that constraint.'
