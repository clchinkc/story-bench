  evidence: 'Version 0 established ritual but felt thinner on interior stakes and
    lacked a clear intersecting neighbor; critics noted missing story text and uneven
    interiority. Across revisions the author added tactile details (mailbox dents,
    timed waypoints), deepened Teddy''s inner markers (breath counting, locket clutch),
    and introduced Elena and the GriefShare pamphlet to mirror Teddy''s avoidance.
    Subtle exposition was trimmed (dream language reduced to a silent image of Martha
    planting violets) and more emotion was shown through action (mimicking concrete
    work rhythms, handing Elena a list, holding Lila). The final draft preserves the
    original strengths (strong, specific routine) while addressing prior weaknesses:
    interiority is richer and rooted in behavior rather than telling, the disruption
    reveals the avoidance of connection/grief, the neighbor''s arc intersects meaningfully,
    Martha is present through absence, and the new path offers community the old path
    couldn''t. Beats move clearly from status quo to disruption, tests, transformation,
    and return, with a resonant, understated ending.'
