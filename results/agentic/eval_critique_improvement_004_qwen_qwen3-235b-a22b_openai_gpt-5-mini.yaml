  evidence: 'Across revisions the author responded to calls for richer interiority
    by swapping abstract lines (e.g., “The past was a detour”) for embodied sensations
    and small actions: peppermint biting his tongue, jaw aching, fingers fumbling
    the tin. Version 0 established the ritual and setting but relied more on summary;
    later versions (as reflected in the critics’ scores rising from ~0.65 to ~0.76)
    add concrete sensory detail and a meaningful encounter with Mr. Patel that ties
    the disruption to Teddy’s avoidance of change. Strengths (the ritual detail, Lorraine’s
    absence as a motif, neighborhood specificity) were preserved and amplified, though
    the Story Circle arc feels only partially completed in the excerpt (disruption
    → unfamiliar path → adaptation begin, but not a full transformed return), which
    is why beat_execution is lower than other scores.'
