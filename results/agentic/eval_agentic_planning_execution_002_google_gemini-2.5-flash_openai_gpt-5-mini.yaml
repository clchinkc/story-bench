  evidence: 'Plan: Includes protagonist, core conflict, setting, and a detailed Call
    to Adventure; missing explicit mentor and psychological Threshold in planning.
    Specificity: Strong sensory and procedural detail (AI, nutrient paste, headphones,
    Antarctic facility, signal description). Adherence: Final output follows the plan
    for Ordinary World and Call to Adventure and includes a Refusal of the Call; it
    introduces Dr. Aris (colleague) but no mentor and the Crossing of the Threshold
    is depicted physically rather than as a psychological interior shift. Constraints:
    Satisfied — (1) isolation shown through behaviors (nutrient paste, headphones,
    dismissed thought of sister, AI), (2) alien signal described as non-anthropomorphic;
    Not satisfied — (3) colleague challenging Yuki (Aris is pleasant, not challenging),
    (4) unconventional mentor absent, (5) Threshold is physical (transport/facility)
    not psychological, (6) no genuine surprising human connection (only perfunctory
    hand touch). Beats: Call to Adventure present, Refusal present, Meeting the Mentor
    missing, Crossing the Threshold present (physical). Narrative quality: Well-written,
    strong atmosphere and pacing, builds tension effectively but misses required emotional/psychological
    turning beats.'
