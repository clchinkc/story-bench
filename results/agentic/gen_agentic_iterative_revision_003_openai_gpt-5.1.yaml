  content: 'By late June the heat pressed down so hard it turned the asphalt outside
    El Rancho Super into a slow, shimmering river. Mateo wiped sweat from his neck,
    adjusted his faded name tag, and rang up another stack of groceries—masa, beans,
    a dozen glass bottles of Jarritos clinking like distant bells.


    “¿Necesita ayuda con las bolsas, doña?” he asked in Spanish without thinking,
    fingers already tying the plastic.


    The woman smiled. “Ay, qué muchacho tan responsable. Your parents must be proud.”


    He answered with the practiced half-smile he’d worn all summer, the one that didn’t
    reach his eyes.


    At home, the swamp cooler rattled in the window, breathing out air that smelled
    faintly of dust and laundry detergent. College flyers crowded the fridge door—Arizona
    State, University of Arizona, two out-of-state schools with glossy photos of green
    lawns Mateo had never walked on. His mom had pinned a rosary above them like a
    blessing or a warning.


    “Did you see?” she called from the stove, flipping tortillas on the comal. “Mira,
    ASU already asking about your housing. Imagine, mijo, only two hours away. You
    can come home every weekend.”


    He kissed her cheek, nodded, and set the table. The housing form sat under his
    elbow all through dinner, edges curling with sweat and salsa stains.


    Later, in his room, the real envelope waited. The one from a college in Oregon
    with a scholarship that made his heart hurt—almost everything paid, plane ticket
    included. He traced the school’s name with his thumb, then shoved it back into
    the drawer when he heard wheels on tile.


    “Ayúdame, mijo,” his grandmother called.


    He slipped the letter under his notebook and went to her. Abuela sat in her recliner,
    floral dress, silver hair pinned back, the evening novela flickering on low volume.
    The oscillating fan clicked as it swept warm air across the room.


    “Siéntate,” she said, patting the couch cushion beside her. “Your mamá says you’re
    quiet these days. Más que antes.”


    “I’m just tired from work,” he muttered.


    “Mm.” Her eyes—cloudy but sharp—studied his face. “Your abuelo used to say that
    when he was lying.”


    He laughed once, airless. On the screen, a handsome actor confessed his love in
    overly dramatic Spanish. Abuela turned the TV off.


    “Tell me,” she said.


    He opened his mouth, closed it. His fingers found the edge of his wallet, pushing
    at the seam until it bit his skin. In his other pocket, his phone buzzed—a text
    from Mr. Herrera, his English teacher.


    How’s the decision coming? Remember: it’s your life, Mateo.


    The words burned.


    He pictured his mom at the stove, his dad’s hands stained with motor oil, Abuela’s
    pill bottles lined up like little soldiers. The narrow streets of Nogales, the
    line of cars at the border, the old men playing lotería in the shade of a liquor
    store awning. All of it pressing on his chest.


    Without thinking, he went to his room, grabbed the Oregon envelope, and came back.
    He placed it on Abuela’s lap.


    She unfolded the letter slowly, lips moving as she read. The fan clicked. Outside,
    a siren wailed faintly, then faded.


    When she finished, she set the paper down, smoothing the creases with careful
    fingers.


    “Muy lejos,” she said.


    He nodded.


    “¿Quieres ir?”


    His throat tightened. Images flashed: pine trees dripping with rain instead of
    dust, a campus where nobody switched languages mid-sentence, where he would just
    be “Matt” if he wanted.


    He shrugged, eyes burning.


    Abuela’s hand, dry and warm, covered his. Her grip was surprisingly strong.


    “Cuando cruzamos la frontera,” she began, voice low, “tu mamá tenía ocho años.
    I was more scared than her. But she—” she tapped his chest, over his heart— “she
    looked forward, not back. She wanted you to be born somewhere you could choose.”


    He stared at their hands. “But who’s going to help you? And mamá, with the bills,
    with…everything?”


    “¿Crees que vine a este país para que te quedes aquí, atrapado en este calor para
    siempre?” Her tone sharpened, but her thumb drew gentle circles on his skin. “You
    think being responsible means never leaving?”


    The word landed heavy between them.


    “Your mamá and papá… they will be sad. I will be sad.” A small smile tugged at
    her lips. “Pero más triste if you stay only for us.”


    His phone buzzed again. This time, Mr. Herrera’s name didn’t feel like an intrusion.
    He remembered sitting in his classroom after school, admission letter in hand,
    the teacher leaning against a desk.


    “I know what it’s like,” Herrera had said quietly. “First in the family. It feels
    like leaving them behind. You’re not. You’re carrying them with you. But you have
    to want it. Not just endure it.”


    In the living room, Abuela squeezed his fingers once more, then let go.


    “Yo no crucé medio desierto para que sigas mis pasos,” she said. “I crossed so
    you could make your own.”


    The air felt thicker, but something inside him loosened. He picked up the letter,
    really reading it for the first time in front of her, lips moving over “award,”
    “tuition,” “welcome.”


    “Can you help me tell them?” he asked finally.


    She nodded. “Claro. I’ll yell at your papá for you.”


    He laughed, the sound startling both of them.


    That night, under the flicker of the kitchen light, he spread the Oregon forms
    on the table. His father frowned at the distance, his mother cried quietly into
    a dish towel. Abuela sat beside him like an anchor, straight-backed, eyes fierce.


    “Es muy lejos,” his dad said.


    “También lo fue este país,” Abuela shot back.


    Silence settled. Then his mom wiped her eyes, came around the table, and pressed
    a pen into his hand.


    “Just promise you’ll call every Sunday,” she whispered.


    His fingers curled around the pen. The page blurred, then cleared. He signed his
    name slowly, each letter steady.


    The swamp cooler rattled on, the desert night humming outside. For the first time,
    the weight on his shoulders shifted—not gone, but balanced differently, shared
    across the table, stretched between here and a place he’d only seen in brochures.


    He set the pen down and exhaled, the air tasting like fear, and freedom, and something
    wholly his.'

    “¿Necesita ayuda con las bolsas, doña?” he asked, fingers already tying the plastic.


    The woman smiled. “Ay, qué muchacho tan responsable. Your parents must be proud.”


    He gave the practiced half-smile he’d worn all summer, then watched her shuffle
    out into the glare. As the automatic doors slid shut, he thumbed open the cracked
    screen of his phone under the counter.


    Congratulations on your full scholarship, the Oregon email still began, bold and
    unread. His thumb hovered over it, then he locked the screen and slid the phone
    away just as his manager called his name.


    By dinner, the desert sky had turned the color of hot metal. The swamp cooler
    rattled in the window, breathing out air that smelled like dust and laundry detergent.
    College flyers crowded the fridge—Arizona State, University of Arizona, two out-of-state
    brochures already curling at the corners. His mom had pinned a rosary above them
    like a blessing or a warning.


    “Did you see?” she called from the stove, flipping tortillas on the comal. “Mira,
    ASU already asking about your housing. Only two hours away. You can come home
    every weekend.”


    He slid into his chair. The ASU housing form sat under his plate, his name already
    printed at the top in neat, black letters. He ate mechanically, eyes fixed on
    the corner of the form where his signature line waited, blank.


    Afterwards, in his room, he closed the door and knelt by the bed. From under a
    stack of notebooks he pulled out the Oregon envelope, edges softened from being
    handled too much. Pine trees and rain on the brochure cover, like another planet.


    He held the acceptance letter up to the slant of evening light, then, at the sound
    of wheels on tile, shoved it back into the drawer so quickly it bent.


    “Ayúdame, mijo,” his grandmother called.


    Abuela sat in her recliner, floral dress, silver hair pinned back, the evening
    novela flickering on low volume. The oscillating fan clicked as it swept warm
    air across the room.


    “Siéntate,” she said, patting the couch. “Your mamá says you’re quiet these days.
    Más que antes.”


    “I’m just tired from work,” he said, though his shoulders were tight, hands restless
    on his knees.


    “Mm.” Her cloudy eyes stayed on him. “Your abuelo used to say that when he was
    lying.”


    On the screen, a handsome actor dropped to his knees, begging forgiveness. Abuela
    clicked the TV off.


    “Enséñame,” she said simply.


    He hesitated, then stood and went to his room. This time, he didn’t hide the envelope
    on the walk back; the paper shook slightly in his hand. He placed it in her lap.


    She read slowly, lips moving. The fan clicked. Outside, a Border Patrol truck
    rumbled past, a low growl fading into the night.


    “Muy lejos,” she murmured when she finished.


    He nodded, staring at a brown spot on the carpet.


    “¿Quieres ir?”


    His jaw worked. He pictured the store aisles, his dad’s hands blackened with motor
    oil, Abuela’s pill bottles lined up on the counter. He also saw rain on glass,
    a campus where no one would hand him forms already halfway filled out for him.


    He didn’t answer. His silence was answer enough.


    Abuela laid the letter aside and placed her hand over his.


    “Cuando cruzamos la frontera,” she said, “I was more scared than your mamá. But
    she… siempre mirando adelante.” Her fingers tapped his chest, over his heart.
    “We didn’t come so you could be tired in the same place forever.”


    He swallowed. “Who’s gonna translate for you? Help with the bills? If I leave—”


    “Cállate.” Her voice was sharp, but her grip was gentle. “Eso no es ser responsable.
    That’s being afraid and calling it duty.”


    His phone buzzed in his pocket. A text from Mr. Herrera lit the screen:


    You don’t owe anyone a smaller life, Mateo. Whatever you choose, make sure it’s
    yours.


    Abuela squinted at the message when he tilted the phone toward her. Her mouth
    twitched.


    “Ese maestro sí entiende,” she said. “Mírame.” He did. “Yo no crucé medio desierto
    para que sigas mis pasos. I crossed so you could make your own.”


    The next night, under the flicker of the kitchen light, he spread both forms on
    the table: ASU’s familiar logo, Oregon’s strange green seal. His father’s forearms
    were folded tight across his chest. His mother twisted a dish towel between her
    hands. Abuela sat beside Mateo, straight-backed.


    “Es muy lejos,” his dad said, nodding at Oregon.


    “También lo fue este país,” Abuela snapped. “Y todavía estamos aquí.”


    Silence. The swamp cooler hummed. A bead of sweat slid down Mateo’s spine.


    His mom moved first. She came around the table, took the ASU form from in front
    of him, and set it gently aside.


    “¿De veras quieres ir?” she asked, voice small.


    He looked at the Oregon letter, then at her. His tongue felt thick, but his hands
    moved: reaching for the pen, for the page. He pressed the pen tip to the signature
    line—and stopped. His hand trembled.


    Abuela’s hand covered his wrist, steadying, then let go.


    He inhaled, long and shaky, and signed: M-a-t-e-o, each letter dark and deliberate.


    His dad’s chair scraped back. For a moment Mateo thought he would walk out. Instead,
    his father circled the table and put a heavy hand on his shoulder, not quite a
    squeeze.


    “Llámanos cada domingo,” he said.


    The words loosened something in Mateo’s chest. The cooler rattled on, the desert
    night wrapped around the house, but the weight on his shoulders felt different—stretched
    now, a line pulled taut between here and the green place on the brochure.


    He looked at his name on the page, then at the family gathered around it. Fear
    sat beside him. So did relief. So did something that felt, for the first time,
    like his own future.'

  content: 'By late June the heat pressed down so hard it turned the asphalt outside
    El Rancho Super into a slow, shimmering river. Mateo wiped sweat from his neck,
    adjusted his faded name tag, and rang up another stack of groceries—masa, a sack
    of oranges, a twelve–pack of Jarritos that clinked like distant bells.


    “¿Necesita ayuda con las bolsas, doña?” he asked, fingers already double-bagging
    without being told.


    The woman smiled. “Ay, qué muchacho tan responsable. Your mamá y tu papá, bien
    orgullosos, ¿verdad?”


    He gave the half-smile he’d worn all summer, the one that felt more like a reflex
    than a feeling. As the automatic doors slid shut behind her, heat glaring white
    beyond the glass, he thumbed open the cracked screen of his phone under the counter.


    Congratulations on your full scholarship, the Oregon email still began, bold and
    unread. His thumb hovered over it, then he locked the screen and slid the phone
    back into his apron just as his manager called his name to help bag ice.


    By dinner, the desert sky had turned the color of hot metal. The swamp cooler
    rattled in the living room window, coughing out air that smelled like wet dust
    and Fabuloso. On the fridge, college flyers jostled for space with the Noviembre
    Virgen de Guadalupe calendar and a magnet from the tire shop where his dad worked—Arizona
    State, University of Arizona, a couple glossy brochures from out-of-state schools
    already curling at the corners. Over everything, his mom had thumbtacked a small
    palm-cross from Domingo de Ramos.


    “Did you see?” she called from the stove, flipping tortillas on the comal, a pot
    of frijoles burbling on the back burner. “Mira, ASU already asking about your
    housing. Only two hours away. You can come home for la carne asada, every weekend
    if you want.”


    “Maybe they’ll make me pay rent,” he said, trying to joke as he slid into his
    chair.


    “Pues claro,” his dad said from the head of the table, rubbing grease from his
    hands with an old shop rag. “University boy, you’ll be rich.”


    The ASU housing form sat under Mateo’s plate, his name already printed at the
    top in neat, black letters. He ate mechanically, eyes fixed on the corner of the
    form where the signature line waited, empty. When his little sister asked if he’d
    bring her back a college hoodie, he mumbled, “Yeah, sure,” without looking up.


    Afterwards, in his room, he closed the door and knelt by the bed. From under a
    stack of AP U.S. History notes he pulled out the Oregon envelope, edges softened
    from being handled too much. The brochure cover showed students in rain jackets
    under tall trees, the green so deep it almost hurt.


    He held the acceptance letter up to the slant of evening light until the words
    blurred, then, at the sound of wheels on tile, shoved it back into the drawer
    so fast the corner bent.


    “Ayúdame, mijo,” his grandmother called.


    Abuela sat in her recliner, floral house dress, silver hair clipped back, Univision’s
    evening novela flickering on low volume. The oscillating fan clicked as it swept
    warm air across the room, pushing around the smell of Vicks from the vapor rub
    on her chest.


    “Siéntate,” she said, patting the couch. “Tu mamá says you’re quiet these days.
    Más que antes.”


    “I’m just tired from work,” he said, shoulders tight, nails digging half moons
    into his palms where she couldn’t see.


    “Ajá.” Her cloudy eyes didn’t leave his face. “Your abuelo used to say that when
    he was lying.”


    On the screen, a handsome actor dropped to his knees, begging forgiveness. Abuela
    clicked the TV off with a small snap.


    “Enséñame,” she said simply.


    He hesitated, jaw clenching, then stood and went to his room. This time, he didn’t
    hide the envelope on the walk back. The paper shook a little in his hand. He placed
    it carefully in her lap.


    She unfolded it and read slowly, lips moving. The fan clicked. A siren wailed
    faintly on the highway toward Nogales, then faded.


    “Muy lejos,” she murmured when she finished. “Oregon.” She said it like it tasted
    strange.


    He nodded, staring at a frayed thread in the couch cushion.


    “¿Quieres ir?” she asked.


    Images crowded in: his dad’s cracked knuckles around a lug wrench, his mom counting
    tips from cleaning houses at the kitchen table, Abuela’s pill bottles lined up
    by the microwave. And over that, rain on sidewalk, not dust. Nobody needing him
    to translate at the pharmacy. Just…being a regular student.


    His throat felt thick. He didn’t answer. His silence hung there.


    Abuela set the letter aside and covered his hand with hers, skin papery but grip
    steady.


    “Cuando cruzamos por Nogales,” she said, “tu mamá tenía ocho años. I was shaking,
    mijo. But she…” She tapped his chest, once, right over his heart. “Siempre mirando
    pa’lante. We didn’t sleep on that bus so you could stay stuck here translating
    bills forever.”


    He let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. “Who’s gonna help you at
    the clinic? And with the bank, and—”


    “Cálmate.” Her voice sharpened, but her thumb rubbed little circles over his knuckles
    like when he was a kid with scraped knees. “Eso no es ser responsable. That’s
    you being scared and pretending it’s for us.”


    His phone buzzed. A text from Mr. Herrera lit the screen:


    Got your Oregon letter scanned for the scholarship file. Proud of you. Whatever
    you choose, make sure it’s *you* choosing.


    Abuela leaned forward, squinting. “¿Qué dice?”


    He translated. She snorted softly. “Ese maestro sí sabe. Listen.” She waited until
    he met her eyes. “Yo no crucé medio desierto para que sigas mis pasos. I crossed
    so you could make your own, aunque me duela.”


    The next night, under the buzzing kitchen light, he laid both forms on the table:
    ASU’s maroon logo, Oregon’s unfamiliar green seal. His father sat at the end with
    a glass of agua de jamaica sweating in his hand, eyes moving from one paper to
    the other. His mother twisted a dish towel until it was a tight rope between her
    fingers. Abuela sat beside Mateo, back straight, rebozo over her shoulders.


    “Es muy lejos,” his dad said finally, nodding at Oregon. He wasn’t angry; he just
    sounded tired.


    “También lo fue este país,” Abuela snapped. “Y mira, aquí estamos.”


    His dad’s mouth tightened, but he didn’t argue. The swamp cooler hummed, pushing
    warm air around.


    His mom came around the table, the towel still in her hands. She picked up the
    ASU form, looked at his name on it, then set it gently aside.


    “Dime la verdad,” she said, voice low. “Si no estuviera yo, si no estuviera tu
    abuela… where would you go?”


    He looked at the Oregon letter, at the pine trees on the brochure, then back at
    her. The answer was there, sitting heavy on his tongue. He didn’t say it. He reached
    instead: for the pen, for the Oregon form. The pen tip hovered over the signature
    line, his hand suddenly not as steady as it was on every permission slip he’d
    ever signed for them.


    Abuela’s hand rested lightly on his wrist, grounding him, then slipped away.


    He inhaled, long and shaky, and wrote: M-a-t-e-o. The letters came out darker
    than he expected, pressed deep into the paper.


    His dad’s chair scraped back. Mateo braced himself. Instead of leaving, his father
    walked around and put a heavy, awkward hand on his shoulder.


    “Llámanos cada domingo,” he said, not quite looking at him. “Y si necesitas dinero…”
    He shrugged, half a joke, half promise. “Pues vemos cómo le hacemos.”


    His mom’s eyes were wet. She cupped his face, thumb brushing the spot where his
    beard would someday grow. “No te olvides el español,” she whispered. “Y tráeme
    un suéter bonito cuando venga el frío.”


    The cooler rattled on, the desert night pressing against the thin walls, but the
    weight on Mateo’s shoulders shifted. It was still there—family, history, expectation—but
    now it stretched outward too, a line pulled taut between this crowded kitchen
    and a rain-soaked campus he’d only seen in pictures.


    He looked at his name on the page, then at the three pairs of eyes on him. Fear
    sat beside him. So did guilt. So did, quietly but unmistakably, something like
    pride.


    For the first time, the future in front of him felt terrifying, and like it might
    actually belong to him.'

    By late June the heat pressed down so hard it turned the asphalt outside El Rancho
    Super into a slow, shimmering river. Mateo wiped sweat from his neck, adjusted
    his faded name tag, and rang up another stack of groceries—masa, a sack of oranges,
    a twelve–pack of Jarritos that clinked like distant bells.


    “¿Necesita ayuda con las bolsas, doña?” he asked, fingers already double-bagging
    without being told.


    The woman smiled. “Ay, qué muchacho tan responsable. Your mamá y tu papá, bien
    orgullosos, ¿verdad?”


    He gave the half-smile he’d worn all summer, the one that felt more like a reflex
    than a feeling. As the automatic doors slid shut behind her, heat glaring white
    beyond the glass, he thumbed open the cracked screen of his phone under the counter.


    Congratulations on your full scholarship, the Oregon email still began, bold and
    unread. His thumb hovered over it, then he locked the screen and slid the phone
    back into his apron just as his manager called his name to help bag ice.


    By dinner, the desert sky had turned the color of hot metal. The swamp cooler
    rattled in the living room window, coughing out air that smelled like wet dust
    and Fabuloso. On the fridge, college flyers jostled for space with the Noviembre
    Virgen de Guadalupe calendar and a magnet from the tire shop where his dad worked—Arizona
    State, University of Arizona, a couple glossy brochures from out-of-state schools
    already curling at the corners. Over everything, his mom had thumbtacked a small
    palm-cross from Domingo de Ramos.


    “Did you see?” she called from the stove, flipping tortillas on the comal, a pot
    of frijoles burbling on the back burner. “Mira, ASU already asking about your

    if you want.”


    “Maybe they’ll make me pay rent,” he said, trying to joke as he slid into his
    chair.


    “Pues claro,” his dad said from the head of the table, rubbing grease from his
    hands with an old shop rag. “University boy, you’ll be rich....

    chair.


    “Pues claro,” his dad said from the head of the table, rubbing grease from his
    hands with an old shop rag. “University boy, you’ll be rich.”


    The ASU housing form sat under Mateo’s plate, his name already printed at the
    top in neat, black letters. He ate mechanically, eyes fixed on the corner of the
    form where the signature line waited, empty. When his little sister asked if he’d
    bring her back a college hoodie, he mumbled, “Yeah, sure,” without looking up.


    In his room later, door closed, he knelt by the bed. From under a stack of AP
    U.S. History notes he pulled out the Oregon envelope, edges softened from being
    handled too much. The brochure showed students in rain jackets under tall trees,
    the green so deep it almost hurt.


    He held the acceptance letter up to the slant of evening light until the words
    blurred. Wheels squeaked on tile in the hallway. He shoved the letter back into
    the drawer so fast the corner bent.


    “Ayúdame, mijo,” his grandmother called.


    Abuela sat in her recliner, floral house dress, silver hair clipped back, Univision’s
    evening novela flickering on low volume. The oscillating fan clicked as it swept
    warm air across the room, pushing around the smell of Vicks from the vapor rub
    on her chest. Her metal walker leaned against the wall, a quiet fact in the corner.


    “Siéntate,” she said, patting the couch. “Tu mamá says you’re quiet these days.
    Más que antes.”


    “I’m just tired from work,” he said, shoulders tight, nails digging half moons
    into his palms where she couldn’t see.


    “Ajá.” Her cloudy eyes didn’t leave his face. “Your abuelo used to say that when
    he was lying. No le sirvió.”


    On the screen, a handsome actor dropped to his knees, begging forgiveness. Abuela
    clicked the TV off with a small snap. For a moment, the room felt too still.


    “Enséñame,” she said.


    He hesitated, jaw working, then stood and went to his room. This time, he didn’t
    hide the envelope on the walk back. The paper shook a little in his hand. He placed
    it in her lap, careful not to crush the wrinkled skin of her knees.


    She unfolded it and read slowly, lips moving. The fan clicked. A siren wailed
    faintly on the highway toward Nogales, then faded. Halfway down the page her mouth
    tightened, just a fraction. She read it again before lowering the paper.


    “Beca completa,” she said, almost to herself. “Mira nomás.” Her fingers grazed
    the school’s name. “Muy lejos.”


    He stared at a frayed thread in the couch cushion. “Yeah.”


    “¿Quieres ir?” she asked.


    Images crowded in: his dad’s cracked knuckles around a lug wrench, his mom counting
    tips from cleaning houses at the kitchen table, Abuela’s pill bottles lined up
    by the microwave. Her hand on his forehead when he was little, checking for fever.
    And over that, something else—rain on sidewalk, not dust; no one needing him to
    translate at the clinic, or argue with the cable company in Spanish; just being
    another kid lugging a backpack across campus.


    His tongue felt like sandpaper. He didn’t answer. His shoulders rose and fell.


    Abuela set the letter aside and covered his hand with hers, skin papery but grip
    steady.


    “Cuando cruzamos por Nogales,” she said, “tu mamá tenía ocho años. I was shaking
    so much I almost dropped her little hand.” A small, crooked smile. “Ella no. She
    looked at the lights on the other side like they were… una promesa.”


    She paused, breath catching a little. Her other hand went unconsciously to her
    chest, where the Vicks tingled beneath her nightgown.


    “We slept on buses, en pisos fríos, con miedo,” she went on, voice thinner but
    firm. “Not so you could get stuck here, explaining copayments to señoras for the
    rest of your life.”


    He let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. “If I leave, who’s gonna
    help you at the clinic? With the bank, with…” The list spilled out before he could
    stop it. “With the papers, the insurance—”


    “Cálmate.” Her voice sharpened, but her thumb rubbed little circles over his knuckles
    like when he was a kid with scraped knees. “Eso no es ser responsable. That’s
    you being scared and putting our names on it.”


    His phone buzzed. A text from Mr. Herrera lit the screen:


    Got your Oregon letter scanned for the scholarship file. Proud of you. Whatever
    you choose, make sure it’s *you* choosing.


    Abuela squinted. “¿Qué dice?”


    He translated. She snorted softly. “Ese maestro sí sabe.” Then, more quietly:
    “Yo también tengo miedo, mijo.”


    He looked up, startled. She held his gaze.


    “You think I want you far, where I can’t hear your keys in the door?” she asked.
    The question trembled in the air, naked. “No. Me rompe el corazón. Pero…” She
    tapped his chest again, gentler. “Yo no crucé medio desierto para que sigas mis
    pasos. I crossed so you could make your own, aunque me duela. ¿Entiendes?”


    Something hot prickled behind his eyes. He nodded, once.


    “Y escucha,” she added. “If you go and it’s too much, you can come back. No es
    traición. It’s just… trying.” She shrugged, a small, tired gesture. “We didn’t
    get that chance.”


    The next night, under the buzzing kitchen light, he laid both forms on the table:
    ASU’s maroon logo, Oregon’s unfamiliar green seal. His father sat at the end with
    a glass of agua de jamaica sweating in his hand, eyes moving from one paper to
    the other. His mother twisted a dish towel until it was a tight rope between her
    fingers. Abuela sat beside Mateo, back straight, rebozo over her shoulders.


    “Es muy lejos,” his dad said finally, nodding at Oregon. He wasn’t angry; he just
    sounded worn.


    “También lo fue este país,” Abuela said. “Y mira, aquí estamos.”


    His dad’s mouth tightened. He looked at her walker, then at Mateo. Whatever argument
    he’d been forming seemed to deflate. He took a slow drink instead.


    His mom came around the table, the towel still in her hands. She picked up the
    ASU form, looked at his printed name, then at him.


    “Dime la verdad,” she said, voice low. “Si no estuviera yo, si no estuviera tu
    abuela… where would you go?”


    He looked at the Oregon letter, at the pine trees on the brochure. He thought
    of Sunday mornings changing Abuela’s TV to misa en español, of his little sister
    in her middle school uniform, of his parents’ faces if he stayed and if he left.
    Guilt pressed on one side, hunger for that other life on the other.


    “I don’t wanna leave you,” he said. It came out small, honest. “But I… I can’t
    stop thinking'
