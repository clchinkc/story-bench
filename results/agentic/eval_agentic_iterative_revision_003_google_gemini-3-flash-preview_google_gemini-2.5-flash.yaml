  evidence: The initial versions (0-3) primarily focused on establishing the setting
    and Mateo's immediate conflict, with minor word changes. The final output significantly
    expands on these initial elements, introducing the grandmother's crucial intervention,
    Mr. Henderson's understanding, and the resolution. The trajectory shows a clear
    progression from a basic setup to a more complete narrative. The core elements
    from the initial versions (heat, Mateo's role, the prescription, the architecture
    deadline) were preserved and built upon. The final output successfully addresses
    most constraints, particularly showing Mateo's internal conflict, the grandmother's
    moment, and Mr. Henderson's understanding. The cultural elements feel authentic.
    The resolution is earned. The only constraint not fully met is 'shown, not told'
    for Mateo's internal conflict, as some of it is still explicitly stated (e.g.,
    'The guilt was a physical tether').
