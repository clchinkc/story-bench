  evidence: 'Initial version established setting but relied more on atmosphere and
    exposition. Revisions incrementally increased showing: by V3 the protagonist''s
    routine (notebook, measurements, gloving, sketching) concretely demonstrated her
    methodical approach; the fog was reframed as an investigative obstacle and potential
    tool for the perpetrator; Old Harlan Fisk''s evasiveness and the damaged boat
    introduced a local secret; and an earlier hint (the Boston missing-persons poster)
    prefigured the later reveal of Sarah''s past failure. Overall the major gains
    occurred in the final revision (V3), which preserved strengths (strong opening
    prose, investigative details) while fixing weaknesses (making fog purposeful,
    showing rather than telling, and inserting a local secret).'
