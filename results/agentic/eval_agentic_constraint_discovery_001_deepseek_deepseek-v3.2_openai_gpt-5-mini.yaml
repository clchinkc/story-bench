  evidence: Only the magic-related constraint was effectively probed (Q1–Q3) and revealed;
    other hidden constraints (mentor death, three-day limit, failed-hero father, reforging
    ancestral sword) were neither asked about nor incorporated. The Ordeal beat is
    well executed, but the mentor-death requirement is missing and the protagonist
    directly uses magic (contrary to the hidden 'cannot use magic' constraint). Questions
    were focused and clear about magic but narrowly targeted (one question text missing),
    leaving major areas uncovered.
