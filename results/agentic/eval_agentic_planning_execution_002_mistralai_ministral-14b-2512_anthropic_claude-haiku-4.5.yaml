  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: The plan is well-structured with clear thematic intent (xenolinguistics
    as psychological quest). The output executes strong atmospheric writing with genuine
    tension. Yuki''s isolation is effectively shown through behavioral specifics (ignoring
    messages, locking herself away, not drinking coffee left for her) rather than
    exposition. The alien signal is genuinely non-anthropomorphic—described as quantum-adaptive,
    self-rewriting, correlating to human catastrophes without linguistic translation.
    Elias functions as a challenging colleague who questions her approach directly.
    The dream sequence provides a moment of genuine human connection (Elias''s concern
    breaking through her detachment). Pacing and prose quality are strong.


    WEAKNESSES: (1) MENTOR FIGURE UNCONVENTIONALITY: Elias is presented as a neuroarchaeologist
    colleague/challenger, but the plan explicitly calls for an ''unconventional mentor
    figure.'' Elias functions more as a peer antagonist than a mentor. The plan mentions
    a mentor but doesn''t clearly establish who fills this role or how they''re unconventional.
    (2) THRESHOLD CROSSING: Only 3 of 4 required beats are clearly executed. ''Call
    to Adventure'' (transmission arrival) ✓, ''Refusal of the Call'' (treating it
    as data, dismissing Elias) ✓, ''Meeting the Mentor'' (unclear/underdeveloped—Elias
    appears but isn''t positioned as mentor), ''Crossing the Threshold'' (not yet
    executed—the story ends at the moment of decision, not the crossing). The final
    line ''let herself listen'' suggests threshold crossing but doesn''t dramatize
    it. (3) PSYCHOLOGICAL THRESHOLD: While the constraint is addressed conceptually
    (Yuki''s fear, her internal resistance), the actual threshold moment isn''t shown—the
    narrative stops at the precipice. (4) HUMAN CONNECTION SURPRISE: The dream sequence
    and Elias''s concern work, but the ''surprise'' element is muted; Yuki''s reaction
    is internal rather than externally surprising.


    TECHNICAL: Plan shows sophisticated understanding of Hero''s Journey adaptation
    but doesn''t fully operationalize the mentor role. Output demonstrates strong
    execution of what was planned, but the plan itself has a structural gap regarding
    the mentor and threshold beats.'
