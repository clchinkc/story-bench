  evidence: The revisions, particularly from V0 to V3, show a clear trajectory of
    improvement in meeting the constraints. The initial versions were largely identical,
    but the final output demonstrates a strong response to the implicit and explicit
    feedback from the critiques. For instance, the 'Marcus almost breaks' moment is
    well-integrated, and the new writer's perception of Marcus is clearly established.
    The humor-before-sadness constraint is also handled effectively. The story's emotional
    complexity and character depth improved significantly, making the final output
    a compelling and well-crafted piece.
