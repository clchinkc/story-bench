  evidence: The initial versions were identical and very short, only setting up Elena's
    competence. The final version significantly expanded on this, introducing the
    conflict and resolution. However, there was no iterative improvement across the
    provided revisions (V0-V3 were identical, and the final output was a large jump
    from V3, suggesting a single large revision rather than iterative refinement).
    No feedback was provided, so responsiveness is 0. Good elements (Elena's competence
    setup) were preserved. The final output successfully addressed most constraints.
    It showed Elena's competence first, the friendship felt genuine and earned (between
    Elena and Dr. Sharma), Elena's transformation was internal, and a specific medical
    detail (oxygen saturation, acute respiratory distress) was included. The ending,
    however, did not feel ambiguous enough regarding her true change; it leaned more
    towards a positive, lasting change. The beats were well-executed, leading to a
    coherent and engaging narrative.
