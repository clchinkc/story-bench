  evidence: 'Early critiques consistently praised the story''s emotional complexity
    (scores ~0.82–0.85). Across the revision notes the text shows little substantive
    change until the final polished excerpt, so responsiveness to critique was low
    (0.25) and measurable improvement across rounds minimal (0.20). Strengths—clear
    craft details, the thematic line from Iris, and the balanced humor/pathos—were
    preserved (0.80). Four of five explicit constraints are met: (1) Marcus elicits
    a laugh before his sadness is revealed; (2) theme is stated by Iris (a minor character);
    (3) concrete comedy craft (whiteboard structure, object work, mugging/knife analogy,
    multiple drafts) is shown; (4) Iris sees through Marcus. The one shortfall is
    the specific phrasing of the required beat where Marcus "almost breaks but covers
    it with a joke": the scene contains an attempted covering joke that fails to fully
    mask his crack (he ultimately admits vulnerability), so it does not clearly show
    him successfully covering the near-break with a joke—hence 4/5 (0.80). Save the
    Cat beats are present in outline form (Theme Stated, Setup, Catalyst, Debate,
    Break Into Two) but many beats (B-story, Midpoint, All Is Lost, Dark Night, Finale)
    are only implied or absent, so beat execution is partial (0.60). Overall narrative
    quality is high—nuanced voice, credible writers'' room, rich emotional layering—hence
    0.85.'
