  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Only 2 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q1 confirmed mentor importance (constraint 1: mentor
    dies - MISSED), Q2 confirmed magical artifact (constraint 5: reforge sword - PARTIALLY
    HIT via artifact, but not the specific sword requirement). Constraints 2 (no direct
    magic), 3 (three-day limit), and 4 (father''s failed heroism) were completely
    unaddressable with the chosen questions. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were generic
    and lacked strategic depth. No questions targeted time pressure, family legacy,
    magic system limitations, or artifact specificity. Questions 3-5 were somewhat
    useful for elimination but didn''t probe deeper into discovered areas. QUESTION
    COVERAGE: Poor coverage - focused heavily on character/artifact presence but missed
    thematic, temporal, and mechanical constraints. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Story
    incorporates mentor (but doesn''t die - MAJOR MISS), magical artifact (Emberstone
    present), and avoids direct magic use somewhat (protagonist uses sword, not spells).
    FAILS on: mentor death during ordeal, three-day deadline, father''s backstory,
    ancestral sword reforging. BEAT EXECUTION: Hero''s journey structure present (Call,
    Threshold, Ordeal, Return) but Ordeal lacks the mentor sacrifice that should anchor
    it. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Well-written, coherent, engaging prose with good pacing
    and atmosphere. However, the story feels incomplete - it resolves too cleanly
    without the tragic/complex elements the hidden constraints would have provided.
    The ending is triumphant but narratively shallow compared to what the constraints
    demanded.'
