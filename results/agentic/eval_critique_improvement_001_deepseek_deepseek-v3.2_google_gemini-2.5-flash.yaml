  evidence: The revisions, particularly from V0 to V1 and beyond, show a clear effort
    to incorporate the feedback regarding Sarah's methodical nature and the narrative
    purpose of the fog. The initial versions had some elements, but the final output
    significantly strengthens these aspects. For instance, the addition of 'mapping
    the town in grids, logging the license plates' and the internal monologue about
    order and walls directly addresses the 'methodical nature through action' constraint.
    The fog's role evolved from mere atmosphere to an active 'accomplice' that 'conspired'
    and 'hidden Riggs’s expression,' fulfilling its narrative purpose. The hints about
    the past case and the local character's secret (Riggs) are well-integrated. The
    ending clearly presents a moment of decision. The core strengths of the prose
    and character voice were maintained and enhanced throughout the revisions.
