    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

  content: 'Sarah Chen measured her coffee by weight, not scoops—fifteen grams of
    dark roast per two hundred fifty milliliters of water, exactly. The digital scale
    on her kitchen counter was the first thing she''d unpacked in the rented cottage,
    even before her case files. Those files sat now in precise chronological stacks
    on the table, each corner aligned, each tab labeled in her neat block print. The
    fog outside pressed against her window like a creditor demanding payment, reducing
    the harbor to smears of gray and the distant clang of buoy bells to mournful,
    irregular punctuation.


    Her phone buzzed at 6:47 AM—four minutes earlier than the first call yesterday,
    seven minutes later than the day before. The harbormaster''s voice was a low rasp.
    "Got something on the rocks by the old cannery. You''d better come."


    She arrived at 7:03, having calculated the exact driving time plus a two-minute
    buffer for the fog. The harbormaster, a man named Gabe who wore his suspicion
    like a second coat, stood at the tide line with his arms crossed. The body lay
    sprawled across the barnacled granite, one arm twisted beneath it, the other reaching
    toward the water. The fog curled around the corpse like it was trying to hide
    something.


    "Fisherman spotted him at dawn," Gabe said. "Current must''ve spat him out during
    the tide change."


    Sarah didn''t answer. She was already pulling on gloves, her mind running through
    the checklist: position, lividity, clothing, visible trauma. The man''s face was
    bloated, unrecognizable, but his jacket was expensive—cashmere, not the tough
    wool locals wore. She photographed everything before touching anything, each angle
    methodical, each distance measured in paces. When she lifted the lapel to check
    for ID, she found instead a small tear in the lining. Her fingers probed it by
    instinct, trained by a thousand similar searches.


    Her fingertips found the edge of something stiff and smooth. She pulled it free:
    a business card, laminated against water damage, with a Los Angeles address and
    a name she knew too well. Her hands didn''t shake. They never shook. But her breathing
    changed, just slightly—an intake that caught somewhere between her ribs.


    The card belonged to Marcus Thorne, the defense attorney who''d dismantled her
    last case. The one that had ended with a witness dead and Sarah''s career in smoldering
    ruins. The man whose client had walked free because she''d missed a single detail,
    one tiny inconsistency in an alibi she''d been too exhausted to verify at 3:00
    AM.


    She''d run three thousand miles to escape that mistake. And now it had washed
    ashore with the tide.


    Gabe was watching her. "Recognize him?"


    Sarah slipped the card into an evidence bag, sealing it with a stroke that was
    almost a caress. "No," she said, her voice level as a ruler. "But I recognize
    the work."


    The harbormaster''s jaw tightened. "Lot of strangers pass through in summer. Off-season,
    though—"


    He stopped. The fog between them thickened, as if it had heard something it wanted
    to conceal.


    Sarah noted his hesitation with the same precision she''d noted the body''s position:
    timestamp 7:08, witness Gabe Moray, possible evasion. She''d file it away, one
    more data point in a pattern she couldn''t yet see but knew was there. The fog
    wasn''t just hiding the horizon; it was hiding connections. The same way it had
    hidden the body until the tide chose to reveal it.


    Her phone buzzed again. The station. They wanted an update.


    She could tell them what she knew: that Marcus Thorne had been in Maine, that
    he''d died violently—there were ligature marks on the neck she hadn''t photographed
    yet, hadn''t documented. She could start the machinery of investigation, bring
    in resources, create a trail of paperwork three thousand miles long.


    Or she could tuck this card away in her personal files, let the tide take the
    body back, and keep running.


    The fog swirled. Gabe waited. The buoy bells rang their irregular warning.


    Sarah''s thumb hovered over her phone screen, her other hand still holding the
    evidence bag. The card inside was a ghost, a message from a past she''d tried
    to drown. Methodical logic told her there was no such thing as coincidence. Something
    else—something she''d been ignoring since she arrived—whispered that some patterns
    only emerged when you stopped measuring and started seeing.


    She made the call. But as she spoke the words—"evidence of possible homicide,
    request full forensic team"—she was already calculating the risks of the other
    path, the one that started with a lie of omission and ended who knew where.


    The fog had lifted just enough to see the next step. Not the destination. '

    FEEDBACK: The writing is engaging and precise. Two minor notes: (1) \"the one\

    \ incident needs specificity. Rather than \"something on the rocks,\" Sarah should\
    \ *see* or *learn the identity of* the body—which triggers recognition of its\

    on her kitchen counter was the first thing she''d unpacked in the rented cottage,
    even before her case files. Those files sat now in precise chronological stacks
    on the table, each corner aligned, each tab labeled in her neat block print—the
    same system that had failed her three thousand miles ago. The fog outside pressed
    against her window like a creditor demanding payment, reducing the harbor to smears
    of gray and the distant clang of buoy bells to mournful, irregular punctuation.


    Her phone buzzed at 6:47 AM—four minutes earlier than the first call yesterday,
    seven minutes later than the day before. The early calls used to panic her, before
    her last case taught her that chaos rarely announced itself politely. The harbormaster''s
    voice was a low rasp. "Got something on the rocks by the old cannery. You''d better
    come."


    She arrived at 7:03, having calculated the exact driving time plus a two-minute
    buffer for the fog. The harbormaster, a man named Gabe who wore his suspicion
    like a second coat, stood at the tide line with his arms crossed. The body lay
    sprawled across the barnacled granite, one arm twisted beneath it, the other reaching
    toward the water. The fog curled around the corpse, thick enough that Sarah had
    to take three deliberate steps closer before she could make out the face. The
    smell hit her first—salt and decay and something chemical she couldn''t place,
    made sharper by the cold damp air.


    She pulled on gloves, her mind running through the checklist: position, lividity,
    clothing, visible trauma. The man''s features were bloated, unrecognizable, but
    his jacket was expensive—cashmere, not the tough wool locals wore. She photographed
    everything before touching anything, each angle methodical, each distance measured
    in paces. When she lifted the lapel to check for ID, she found instead a small
    tear in the lining. Her fingers probed it by instinct.


    Her fingertips found the edge of something stiff and smooth. She pulled it free:
    a business card, laminated against water damage, with a Los Angeles address and
    a name she knew too well. Her hands didn''t shake. They never shook. But her breathing
    changed, just slightly—an intake that caught somewhere between her ribs.


    The card belonged to Marcus Thorne, the defense attorney who''d dismantled her
    last case. The one that had ended with a witness dead and Sarah''s career in smoldering
    ruins. The man whose client had walked free because she''d missed a single detail,
    one tiny inconsistency in an alibi she''d been too exhausted to verify at 3:00
    AM.


    She''d run three thousand miles to escape that mistake. And now it had washed
    ashore with the tide.


    Gabe was watching her. "Recognize him?"


    For a moment, her fingers trembled with the urge to slip the card into her jacket

    Gabe''s jaw tightened. "Lot of strangers pass through in summer. Off-season, though—"
    He stopped, his eyes tracking something over her shoulder toward the empty cannery.
    When he looked back, his expression had shuttered closed. "Current''s tricky here.
    Sometimes things wash up from places you''d never expect."


    Sarah noted his hesitation and the careful evasion: timestamp 7:08, witness Gabe
    Moray, possible knowledge of origin. The fog between them seemed to thicken, matching
    the static in her own head. It wasn''t just hiding the horizon; it was hiding
    connections, obscuring the line between what she knew and what she feared.


    Her phone buzzed. The station. They wanted an update.


    She could tell them what she knew: that Marcus Thorne had been in Maine, that
    he''d died violently—there were ligature marks on the neck she hadn''t photographed
    yet, hadn''t documented. She could start the machinery of investigation, bring
    in resources, create a trail of paperwork three thousand miles long.


    Or she could tuck this card away in her personal files, let the tide take the
    body back, and keep running.


    The fog swirled. Gabe waited, his arms still crossed, his posture too deliberate.
    The buoy bells rang their irregular warning. Sarah''s thumb hovered over her phone
    screen, her other hand holding the evidence bag. For a moment, her fingers trembled
    with the urge to slip the card into her jacket pocket instead.


    She looked at Gabe''s closed expression, the fog that hid whatever he wouldn''t
    say, and made her choice. '

output: 'Sarah Chen measured her coffee by weight, not scoops—fifteen grams of dark
  roast per two hundred fifty milliliters of water, exactly. The digital scale on
  her kitchen counter was the first thing she''d unpacked in the rented cottage, even
  before her case files. Those files sat now in precise chronological stacks on the
  table, each corner aligned, each tab labeled in her neat block print—the same system
  that had failed her three thousand miles ago. The fog outside pressed against her
  window like a creditor demanding payment, reducing the harbor to smears of gray
  and the distant clang of buoy bells to mournful, irregular punctuation.


  Her phone buzzed at 6:47 AM—four minutes earlier than the first call yesterday,
  seven minutes later than the day before. She noted the pattern without the old surge
  of adrenaline, then answered. The harbormaster''s voice was a low rasp. "Got something
  on the rocks by the old cannery. You''d better come."


  She arrived at 7:03, having calculated the exact driving time plus a two-minute
  buffer for the fog. The harbormaster, a man named Gabe who wore his suspicion like
  a second coat, stood at the tide line with his arms crossed. The body lay sprawled
  across the barnacled granite, one arm twisted beneath it, the other reaching toward
  the water. The fog curled around the corpse, thick enough that Sarah had to take
  three deliberate steps closer before she could make out the face. The smell hit
  her first—salt and decay and something chemical she couldn''t place, made sharper
  by the cold damp air.


  She pulled on gloves, her mind running through the checklist: position, lividity,
  clothing, visible trauma. The man''s features were bloated, unrecognizable, but
  his jacket was expensive—cashmere, not the tough wool locals wore. She photographed
  everything before touching anything, each angle methodical, each distance measured
  in paces. When she lifted the lapel to check for ID, she found instead a small tear
  in the lining. Her fingers probed it by instinct.


  Her fingertips found the edge of something stiff and smooth. She pulled it free:
  a business card, laminated against water damage, with a Los Angeles address and
  a name she knew too well. Her hands didn''t shake. They never shook. But her breathing
  changed, just slightly—an intake that caught somewhere between her ribs.


  The card belonged to Marcus Thorne, the defense attorney who''d dismantled her last
  case. The one that had ended with a witness dead and Sarah''s career in smoldering
  ruins. The man whose client had walked free because she''d missed a single detail,
  one tiny inconsistency in an alibi she''d been too exhausted to verify at 3:00 AM.


  She''d run three thousand miles to escape that mistake. And now it had washed ashore
  with the tide.


  Gabe was watching her. "Recognize him?"


  "His face is too degraded," she said, her voice level as a ruler. "But the clothing''s
  wrong for this place."


  Gabe''s jaw tightened. "Lot of strangers pass through in summer. Off-season, though—"
  He stopped, his eyes tracking something over her shoulder toward the empty cannery.
