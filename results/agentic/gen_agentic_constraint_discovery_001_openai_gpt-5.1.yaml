  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: 'In the village of Alder Ford, where river mist curled around the anvils
    each dawn, a young blacksmith’s apprentice named Garran knew only the rhythm of
    hammer and bellows. His days were measured in sparks and soot, his nights in the
    ache of arms and the distant tolling of the city’s warning bells. Rumors of encroaching
    darkness drifted in with travelers and iron traders, but they were only stories,
    far away from the comfort of the forge fire.


    The Call to Adventure came on a rainless night, when the sky turned the color
    of extinguished coal. A rider in the king’s livery arrived, horse foam-flecked,
    eyes wide with a fear Garran had never seen in grown men. From his saddlebag he
    drew a blade of ancient make—once bright, now dulled and spider-webbed with black
    cracks. “The Sunsteel is failing,” the rider rasped. “The old smith says only
    his apprentice has hands steady enough to reforge it. Without it, the darkness
    will take the capital by week’s end.”


    Garran backed away from the ruined sword. He was just an apprentice who could
    barely temper horseshoes without burning them. The idea of touching a king’s blade,
    let alone remaking it, seemed madness. He refused, mumbling that the old smith
    exaggerated, that someone else—anyone else—would be better. But that night, as
    he lay awake, he felt the forge’s silence like an accusation. Outside, the warning
    bells tolled on and on.


    By dawn he had surrendered his refusal. He would go to the capital, he told his
    master, just to try. The old blacksmith pressed a calloused hand to Garran’s shoulder,
    eyes shining with pride and sorrow. “Steel remembers the hand that shapes it,”
    he said. “Shape this one true, lad, and may it remember you kindly.” With a small
    pack, a travel hammer at his belt, and the broken Sunsteel wrapped in oilcloth,
    Garran left Alder Ford for the first time in his life.


    Crossing the Threshold was not a single step but a series of them. The road to
    the capital passed beneath arches of dead trees, their branches stripped bare
    though it was high summer. A gray pall hung over the fields; crops shivered without
    wind. At the old stone bridge, where the river ran black and sluggish, the rider
    turned back, his duty done. Garran walked on alone, each step carrying him farther
    from forge-smoke and familiar faces, deeper into a kingdom already surrendering
    to shadow.


    In the capital, daylight had thinned to a weak, colorless wash. The king’s court
    was gathered not in silks but in chain and boiled leather. Garran was brought
    before the Royal Smithy, its furnaces choking on cold air that refused to hold
    heat. With the aid of the old master smith, who had trained Garran’s mentor, he
    set to work. Days bled together in a haze of failing flames and stubborn metal
    that groaned like a living thing. The Sunsteel resisted the hammer, its black
    fractures weeping shadow instead of slag.


    Yet there were allies. The old master guided Garran’s hand when his own trembled.
    Palace guards brought coal from secret stores, risking punishment to feed the
    starving fires. A silent priest of the Dawn Vigil stood watch, murmuring forgotten
    words that kept the shadows from slithering too close to the anvil. None betrayed
    him; none turned away when the forge lights flickered and the darkness outside
    clawed at the shutters.


    At last the Approach to the Inmost Cave came, not in tunnels or catacombs, but
    in the palace’s highest tower, where the air itself stank of fear. The Sunsteel,
    half-reforged, lay on the anvil, its edge a line of dull gray twilight. Below,
    the city screamed. The darkness had breached the walls in a tide of formless black,
    swallowing torches, men, and stone alike. The king demanded a weapon; the priest
    insisted the blade was not yet ready. Garran knew they were both right—and both
    wrong.


    The Ordeal began when Garran lifted the unfinished sword and stepped onto the
    tower’s edge. The shadows below sensed the Sunsteel and surged upward, a living
    void eager to snuff it out. The priest called out that true Sunsteel needed more
    than fire and hammer; it needed a sacrifice to bind light to metal. The old master
    did not argue. He only met Garran’s eyes, and in that gaze Garran found neither
    command nor plea, only trust.


    The darkness rose, licking at the parapets, flooding the courtyard, reaching for
    the tower. Garran understood then that the forge had merely prepared him for this
    final shaping. Steel remembered the hand that shaped it; now the blade would remember
    the life that completed it. He drew the unfinished sword across his palm, letting
    his blood seep into the fractured metal. Pain burst through him as the Sunsteel
    drank, the cracks glowing with a harsh, unforgiving light.


    Light exploded outward, not warm or golden, but white and searing as a star’s
    death. The darkness shrieked, shriveling under its glare, peeling away from stone
    and flesh. The wave rushed across the kingdom, burning shadow from field and forest,
    purging every corner it had touched. The city’s screams turned to stunned silence
    as void-black tendrils crumbled into soot.


    When the light faded, the kingdom was saved. The sky was clear for the first time
    in months, but there was no cheer on the tower. Garran lay on the cold stone,
    the reforged Sunsteel gleaming beside his still hand, its edge now bright as noon.
    The old master knelt, but there was no breath left to catch, no heartbeat to coax
    back.


    They carried Garran’s body to the silent forge, laying him where he had once stood
    as a wide-eyed boy before an anvil. Songs would be written, the priest said. Statues
    would be raised. The darkness was gone, the kingdom secured, the future reclaimed.


    Yet the Sunsteel’s gleam was hard and distant, casting more shadow than warmth
    in the corners of the smithy. The people returned to their lives beneath a cleansed
    sky, but the cost hung over them like a weight that would not lift. The kingdom
    endured, but joy did not return as it had been. And in Alder Ford, each dawn,
    the hammer beat on the anvil with a hollow echo, as if something vital had been
    driven out of the world along with the darkness.'
