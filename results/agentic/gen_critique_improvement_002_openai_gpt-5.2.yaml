    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

  content: 'Marcus Webb stood at the whiteboard like a man giving a TED Talk on drowning.


    Under the fluorescent hum, the room looked exactly like comedy should: a horseshoe
    table littered with cold Thai takeout, half-empty LaCroix, and a museum exhibit
    of chewed pen caps. Every square inch of board space was colonized by structure—A-story
    beats in blue marker, B-story in green, “RUNNER: NEIGHBOR’S DOG?” boxed in red
    like it had earned representation. Above it all, someone had drawn a smiley face
    with the eyes crossed out.


    Marcus clicked his marker like a metronome. “Okay,” he said, tapping the board
    where ACT TWO lived, “our lead finds out she’s been dating her therapist. That’s
    the twist. The joke is not that therapy is bad—therapy is great—”


    He stopped, deadpan, and added, “—but it is awkward when your co-pay is emotional
    intimacy.”


    The room gave him what it always gave him: a wave of laughter that was partly
    relief, partly professional courtesy. Someone slapped the table. Someone wrote
    it down as if it were oxygen. Marcus let the laugh pass over him without entering.


    He scribbled “TAG?” under the scene, then underlined it three times.


    “You’re on a roll, Webb,” said Phil, the script coordinator, with the cheery exhaustion
    of a man who had memorized everyone’s dietary restrictions and secrets. Phil held
    a stack of pages and a laptop like a server at a restaurant that only served panic.
    “If we keep this up, we’ll have a draft that can be rejected by every network
    by Friday.”


    Marcus didn’t look up. “Dreams do come true.”


    They were in week three of pilot season, which meant the writers’ room had become
    less a workplace and more a bunker. The showrunner—Dana—paced with her headset
    off like she was trying to remember the world before notes calls. Two staff writers
    argued quietly about whether the protagonist’s humiliating moment should be a
    spit take or a malfunctioning bidet.


    Marcus listened to all of it the way a seasoned paramedic listened to sirens:
    useful information, no feeling attached.


    Phil set the pages down near Marcus. “Also—Dana, FYI—we’re getting a new writer.”


    Dana stopped pacing. “Today?”


    Phil nodded. “Network wants ‘fresh perspective.’ Translation: someone under thirty
    who knows what TikTok is.”


    “We know what TikTok is,” said Gary, a staff writer, offended. “It’s where you
    go to watch teenagers teach you you’re dying wrong.”


    Marcus capped his marker. “Great. A youth. Finally, someone to explain memes to
    us as we age in real time.”


    Phil’s smile tugged sideways as if he were debating saying something that mattered.
    He went with the version that passed for small talk in this room. “Just… be decent.
    New people get chewed up in here.”


    Before Marcus could respond, Dana pointed at the board. “Theme check,” she said,
    which in this room meant: What are we secretly talking about while making dick
    jokes?


    Phil, still standing, lifted his coffee like a toast. “It’s about what makes you
    laugh when nobody’s watching,” he said. “Not what gets a laugh. What makes you
    laugh.”


    No one argued. A quiet landed—brief, uncomfortable, honest. Then Dana clapped
    once, sharp. “Okay! Great. Back to ruining joy with structure.”


    The door opened with the timid confidence of someone who’d rehearsed knocking.


    She stepped in holding a tote bag and a legal pad that looked too clean for this
    environment. Mid-to-late twenties. Dark hair pulled back. Eyes alert in a way
    that wasn’t wide-eyed—more like she’d already learned to read rooms for exits.


    “Hi,” she said. “I’m Wren Park. I’m the… ‘fresh perspective.’”


    Dana crossed the room and shook her hand. “Dana. Welcome to the circus.”


    Wren scanned the whiteboards, the takeout graveyard, the printed pages full of
    jokes bracketed with [ALT?], and the way everyone’s posture said, We are being
    funny at gunpoint.


    Then her eyes landed on Marcus, still by the board like it was holding him upright.


    “You’re Marcus Webb,” she said, not asking.


    Marcus lifted two fingers in acknowledgment. “Guilty. If anyone asks, I’m also
    thirty-four, moisturized, and emotionally available.”


    A couple writers laughed. Wren didn’t. She smiled, but it didn’t soften her gaze.


    Dana pulled Wren into the horseshoe, pointing her at an open chair. “We’re breaking
    Act Two. Marcus has a twist: lead’s dating her therapist.”


    Wren sat, opened her pad, and looked at the board. “So the engine is: she’s trying
    to optimize her life, right? Like, she’s ‘doing the work’—” She air-quoted without
    irony, which meant she had done enough work to hate the phrase. “—but she’s outsourcing
    it.”


    Gary leaned in. “Yes. Exactly.”


    Wren nodded slowly. “Then the joke isn’t ‘therapy is awkward.’ The joke is she
    thinks self-awareness is a subscription service.”


    Marcus felt something—an old spark of recognition. Not joy. Not yet. But a tiny,
    infuriating flicker of: Oh. She’s good.


    He heard himself say, “So in the act break, she tries to cancel her therapist
    like an app.”


    Dana grinned. “That’s funny.”


    Wren wrote it down, then looked at Marcus again. “You don’t laugh when you pitch,”
    she said, quiet but clear.


    The room froze in the way it always did when someone accidentally named the weather.


    Marcus let his mouth do what it was trained to do. “Sure I do,” he said. “It’s
    just… internal. Like my cholesterol.”


    A few people chuckled, grateful for the release.


    Wren didn’t laugh. She leaned in a fraction. “No,” she said, not unkind. “You’re
    performing laughing. It’s different.”


    Marcus felt his chest tighten, a fast, stupid betrayal. For a second, the room
    blurred at the edges, like the world was about to tilt. He swallowed, hard, and
    looked back at the board as if it were a safe document.


    “Okay,” he said too brightly, “new rule: nobody psychoanalyzes the guy holding
    the markers. That’s like heckling the tightrope walker. You’ll feel terrible when
    I fall.”


    He capped a marker he wasn’t using. His hand shook—just enough that the cap clicked
    twice.


    Dana, sensing the shift but not wanting to lose momentum, pointed at the board.
    “Runner. Neighbor’s dog. We need a button that pays off the dog.”


    Wren raised her hand, but her eyes stayed on Marcus. “What if the dog is in her
    therapist’s office,” she said, “because the therapist is using it as an emotional
    support animal… for himself.”


    Gary laughed, real and loud. Dana laughed, too. Even Phil snorted.


    Marcus didn’t laugh. But something in him loosened anyway, like a knot admitting
    it existed.


    He turned to Wren, intending to be sharp, to be the version of himself that could
    crush optimism efficiently and move on.


    Instead, he heard Phil’s earlier toast echo in his head—what makes you laugh when
    nobody’s watching—and felt, for the first time in a long time, the faint outline
    of a question he didn’t hate.


    Wren met his stare without flinching.


    “Good pitch,” Marcus said, voice controlled. “Welcome to the bunker.”


    Wren’s smile finally reached her eyes. “Thanks,” she said. “I didn’t come here
    to get eaten.”


    Marcus managed a small, practiced smirk. “Then you’re already funnier than most
    of us.”


    And on the board, under RUNNER: NEIGHBOR’S DOG?, he wrote in red: “SUPPORT ANIMAL
    FOR THERAPIST.”


    His handwriting wobbled, but the letters held.'

  content: 'Marcus Webb stood at the whiteboard like a man giving a TED Talk on drowning,
    marker poised, eyes tracking the room the way a comic tracks a heckler—ready,
    detached, already tired.


    The Los Angeles pilot-season writers’ room looked like a punchline’s autopsy:
    a horseshoe table crowded with cold Thai takeout, half-crushed LaCroix, and a
    graveyard of legal pads. The whiteboards were tiled with craft—A-story beats in
    blue, B-story in green, act breaks underlined like threats. Someone had written
    SETUP / TURN / ESCALATE / TILT in block letters and drawn a smiley face beside
    it with X’s for eyes.


    On the corner of the main board, taped low where only the person at the board
    would see it, was a tiny photo printout: Marcus at some old open mic, mouth wide
    in mid-laugh, the kind of laugh that made his whole face participate. The paper
    had yellowed at the edges.


    Dana, the showrunner, snapped her fingers. “Webb. Give it to us.”


    Marcus blinked once, like he’d been yanked out of a hallway. He clicked his marker—one,
    two—like a metronome and tapped ACT TWO.


    “Okay,” he said. “Our lead finds out she’s been dating her therapist. That’s the
    twist. And the joke is not that therapy is bad—therapy is great—”


    He paused, eyes flicking, involuntarily, to the taped photo.


    “—but it is awkward,” he added deadpan, “when your co-pay is emotional intimacy.”


    The room laughed on cue: a wave of relief, a currency exchange. Someone slapped
    the table. Someone wrote it down as if it were oxygen. Marcus let the laugh pass
    over him without entering.


    He wrote TAG? under the scene and underlined it three times. His underline was
    too straight, like he’d trained it.


    “You’re on a roll, Webb,” said Phil, the script coordinator, who carried a laptop
    and a stack of sides like a waiter in a restaurant that only served panic. “If
    we keep this up, we’ll have a draft that can be rejected by every network by Friday.”


    Marcus didn’t look away from the board. “Dreams do come true.”


    Dana paced, headset off, as if trying to remember the world before notes calls.
    Two staff writers argued quietly about whether the protagonist’s humiliating moment
    should be a spit-take or a malfunctioning bidet. (The bidet guy was losing, but
    refusing to concede.)


    Phil set pages beside Marcus. “Also—Dana—network just confirmed. We’re getting
    a new writer.”


    Dana stopped. “Today?”


    Phil nodded. “They want ‘fresh perspective.’ Translation: someone under thirty
    who knows what TikTok is.”


    “We know what TikTok is,” Gary muttered. “It’s where teenagers teach you you’re
    dying wrong.”


    Marcus capped his marker. “Great. A youth. Finally, someone to explain memes to
    us as we age in real time.”


    Phil’s smile tugged sideways. “Just… be decent. New people get chewed up in here.”


    Dana pointed at the board. “Theme check,” she said, the room’s version of a prayer:
    what are we actually saying underneath the jokes?


    Phil lifted his coffee like a toast, already half turning to go refill it. “It’s
    about what makes you laugh when nobody’s watching,” he said. “Not what gets a
    laugh. What makes you laugh—”


    “Okay!” Dana clapped once, sharp, as if sincerity might bill them overtime. “Back
    to ruining joy with structure.”


    Phil shrugged and headed for the door, his line left behind like a dropped coin
    no one had time to pick up.


    A knock—hesitant, rehearsed.


    The door opened and a woman stepped in with a tote bag and a legal pad that looked
    too clean for this place. Mid-to-late twenties. Dark hair pulled back. Her eyes
    weren’t wide; they were calibrated, like she’d already learned how rooms could
    hurt you and what angles to keep.


    “Hi,” she said. “I’m Wren Park. I’m the… ‘fresh perspective.’”


    Dana crossed the room and shook her hand. “Dana. Welcome to the circus. Grab a
    chair.”


    Wren’s gaze swept the space: the boards, the takeout, the printed pages bracketed
    with [ALT?] and [CUT?], the way everyone sat forward as if laughter could be manufactured
    by posture. Then her eyes landed on Marcus at the board.


    “You’re Marcus Webb,” she said, not asking.


    Marcus lifted two fingers. “Guilty. If anyone asks, I’m also thirty-four, moisturized,
    and emotionally available.”


    A couple writers laughed. Wren’s mouth curved, but she didn’t give him the satisfaction
    of a laugh.


    Dana gestured to the board. “We’re breaking Act Two. Marcus has a twist: lead’s
    been dating her therapist.”


    Wren sat, clicked her pen, and studied the blue and green lanes like they were
    code.


    “So the engine is she’s trying to optimize her life,” Wren said. “She’s ‘doing
    the work’—” She air-quoted without irony, which meant she’d done enough work to
    hate the phrase. “—but she’s outsourcing it.”


    Gary leaned in. “Yes. Exactly.”


    Wren nodded. “Then the joke isn’t ‘therapy is awkward.’ The joke is she thinks
    self-awareness is a subscription service.”


    Marcus felt something spark—annoying, familiar. Not joy. But recognition. She
    was good.


    He heard himself say, “So in the act break, she tries to cancel her therapist
    like an app.”


    Dana grinned. “That’s funny. Put it up.”


    Marcus uncapped the red marker to write it near ACT TWO. His hand hovered.


    Wren looked at him, still and direct. “You don’t laugh when you pitch,” she said.


    The room went quiet the way it does when someone accidentally names the weather.


    Marcus’s throat tightened, fast and stupid. For a second, the whiteboard glare
    seemed too bright, as if the room were exposing him on purpose.


    “Sure I do,” he said, the line arriving on muscle memory. “It’s just… internal.
    Like my cholesterol.”


    A few people chuckled—grateful, nervous.


    Wren didn’t laugh. “No,” she said. “That’s not it.”


    Dana gave a small, warning look—keep the room moving, keep the air breathable—but
    didn’t interrupt.


    Wren kept her voice even. “You’re performing laughing. It’s different.”


    Marcus stared at the board as if it could give him directions. He felt the urge—sharp,
    reflexive—to cut her down, to teach her what this place taught everyone: don’t
    ask for sincerity on a deadline.


    Instead, he swallowed. His fingers tightened on the marker until his knuckles
    went pale.


    “You’ve been here,” Marcus said, too lightly, “what, twelve seconds? And you’re
    already doing notes on my face?”


    Wren’s expression didn’t change. “It’s not a note. It’s an observation.”


    Gary shifted, uncomfortable. Someone rustled pages too loudly. Dana opened her
    mouth, closed it.


    Marcus’s chest pulled tight again. He could feel the edge of something he refused
    to name—like stepping up to a trapdoor and pretending it’s a stage.


    “Okay,” he said, brighter than he meant, “new rule: nobody psychoanalyzes the
    guy holding the markers. That’s like heckling the tightrope walker.”


    No one laughed this time. Not really.


    Marcus forced a grin anyway. “You’ll feel terrible when I fall.”


    He turned back to the board to write CANCEL THERAPIST LIKE AN APP—ACT BREAK. The
    red marker touched down and his hand betrayed him; the letters slanted, the line
    wobbling on the first word, as if the ink had caught on a tremor.


    Dana noticed. Wren noticed. Marcus pretended not to.


    Dana cleared her throat, merciful. “Okay. Runner. Neighbor’s dog. We need a button
    that pays off the dog.”


    Wren raised her hand, but her eyes stayed on Marcus, like she was offering him
    a rope without calling it that.


    “What if the dog is in the therapist’s office,” Wren said, “because the therapist
    is using it as an emotional support animal… for himself.”


    Gary laughed—real and loud. Dana laughed, too, relieved. Even from the doorway,
    Phil snorted as he returned with fresh coffee, like he’d walked back in at the
    exact right second to keep believing this job was bearable.


    Marcus didn’t laugh. But something in him loosened anyway, like a knot admitting
    it existed.


    He turned to Wren, intending to be sharp, to be the version of himself that could
    crush optimism efficiently and move on.


    Instead, he heard Phil’s half-interrupted toast in his head—what makes you laugh
    when nobody’s watching—and felt the faint outline of a question he didn’t hate.


    Wren met his stare without flinching.


    “Good pitch,” Marcus said, voice controlled. “Welcome to the bunker.”


    Wren’s smile finally reached her eyes. “Thanks,” she said. “I didn’t come here
    to get eaten.”


    Marcus managed a practiced smirk, still keeping one hand on the'

  content: 'Marcus Webb stood at the whiteboard like a man giving a TED Talk on drowning,
    marker poised, eyes tracking the room the way a comic tracks a heckler—ready,
    detached, already tired.


    The Los Angeles pilot-season writers’ room looked like a punchline’s autopsy:
    a horseshoe table crowded with cold Thai takeout, half-crushed LaCroix, and a
    graveyard of legal pads. The whiteboards were tiled with craft—A-story beats in
    blue, B-story in green, act breaks underlined like threats. Someone had written
    SETUP / TURN / ESCALATE / TILT in block letters and drawn a smiley face beside
    it with X’s for eyes.


    On the corner of the main board, taped low where only the person at the board
    would see it, was a tiny photo printout. Marcus at an open mic—three years ago,
    before the laugh left him. He was bent forward, hand on his stomach like he couldn’t
    breathe from it, eyes squeezed shut in a way that meant the joke had surprised
    him too. In the background: a woman’s hand mid-clap, blurred, wedding band catching
    stage light like a small flare. The edges of the photo had yellowed from being
    handled and re-taped, handled and re-taped, like a talisman that stopped working.


    Marcus tried not to look at it.


    He looked at it anyway, the way you worry a sore tooth with your tongue.


    Dana, the showrunner, snapped her fingers. “Webb. Give it to us.”


    Marcus blinked once, like he’d been yanked out of a hallway. He clicked his marker—one,
    two—like a metronome and tapped ACT TWO.


    “Okay,” he said. “Our lead finds out she’s been dating her therapist. That’s the
    twist. And the joke is not that therapy is bad—therapy is great—”


    His eyes flicked, involuntarily, to the photo.


    “—but it is awkward,” he added deadpan, “when your co-pay is emotional intimacy.”


    The room laughed on cue: a wave of relief, a currency exchange. Someone slapped
    the table. Someone wrote it down as if it were oxygen. Marcus let the laugh pass
    over him without entering.


    He wrote TAG? under the scene and underlined it three times. His underline was
    too straight, like he’d trained it.


    “You’re on a roll, Webb,” said Phil, the script coordinator, who carried a laptop
    and a stack of sides like a waiter in a restaurant that only served panic. “If
    we keep this up, we’ll have a draft that can be rejected by every network by Friday.”


    Marcus didn’t look away from the board. “Dreams do come true.”


    Dana paced, headset off, as if trying to remember the world before notes calls.
    Two staff writers argued quietly about whether the protagonist’s humiliating moment
    should be a spit-take or a malfunctioning bidet. (The bidet guy was losing, but
    refusing to concede on principle.)


    Phil set pages beside Marcus. “Also—Dana—network just confirmed. We’re getting
    a new writer.”


    Dana stopped. “Today?”


    Phil nodded. “They want ‘fresh perspective.’ Translation: someone under thirty
    who knows what TikTok is.”


    “We know what TikTok is,” Gary muttered. “It’s where teenagers teach you you’re
    dying wrong.”


    Marcus capped his marker. “Great. A youth. Finally, someone to explain memes to
    us as we age in real time.”


    Phil’s smile tugged sideways. “Just… be decent. New people get chewed up in here.”


    Dana pointed at the board. “Theme check,” she said, the room’s version of a prayer:
    what are we actually saying underneath the jokes?


    Phil lifted his coffee like a toast, already half turning to go refill it. “It’s
    about what makes you laugh when nobody’s watching,” he said. “Not what gets a
    laugh. What makes you laugh—”


    “Okay!” Dana clapped once, sharp, as if sincerity might bill them overtime. “Back
    to ruining joy with structure.”


    Phil shrugged and headed for the door, his line left behind like a dropped coin
    no one had time to pick up.


    A knock—hesitant, rehearsed.


    The door opened and a woman stepped in with a tote bag and a legal pad that looked
    too clean for this place. Mid-to-late twenties. Dark hair pulled back. Her eyes
    weren’t wide; they were calibrated, like she’d already learned how rooms could
    hurt you and what angles to keep.


    “Hi,” she said. “I’m Wren Park. I’m the… ‘fresh perspective.’”


    Dana crossed the room and shook her hand. “Dana. Welcome to the circus. Grab a
    chair.”


    Wren’s gaze swept the space: the boards, the takeout, the printed pages bracketed
    with [ALT?] and [CUT?], the way everyone sat forward as if laughter could be manufactured
    by posture. Then her eyes landed on Marcus at the board—and dropped, briefly,
    to the little photo taped low.


    She looked back up at him. Not pity. Not awe. A quick assessment that said: I
    see the bruise; I’m not going to press it just to prove I can.


    “You’re Marcus Webb,” she said, not asking.


    Marcus lifted two fingers. “Guilty. If anyone asks, I’m also thirty-four, moisturized,
    and emotionally available.”


    A couple writers laughed. Wren’s mouth curved, but she didn’t give him the satisfaction
    of a laugh.


    Dana gestured to the board. “We’re breaking Act Two. Marcus has a twist: lead’s
    been dating her therapist.”


    Wren sat, clicked her pen, and studied the blue and green lanes like they were
    code. “So the engine is she’s trying to optimize her life,” Wren said. “She’s
    ‘doing the work’—” She air-quoted without irony, which meant she’d done enough
    work to hate the phrase. “—but she’s outsourcing it.”


    Gary leaned in. “Yes. Exactly.”


    Wren nodded. “Then the joke isn’t ‘therapy is awkward.’ The joke is she thinks
    self-awareness is a subscription service.”


    Marcus felt something spark—annoying, familiar. Not joy. But recognition. She
    was good.


    He heard himself say, “So in the act break, she tries to cancel her therapist
    like an app.”


    Dana grinned. “That’s funny. Put it up.”


    Marcus uncapped the red marker to write it near ACT TWO. His hand hovered, as
    if the board had turned into a window and not a surface.


    Wren looked at him, still and direct. “You don’t laugh when you pitch,” she said.


    The room went quiet the way it does when someone accidentally names the weather.


    Marcus’s throat tightened, fast and stupid. For a second, the whiteboard glare
    seemed too bright, as if the room were exposing him on purpose. He realized he’d
    stopped breathing—his lungs held open like a punchline he couldn’t land. His jaw
    clenched; he felt a dull ache bloom at his molars.


    “Sure I do,” he said, the line arriving on muscle memory. “It’s just… internal.
    Like my cholesterol.”


    A few people chuckled—grateful, nervous.


    Wren didn’t laugh. “No,” she said. “That’s not it.”


    Dana gave a small, warning look—keep the room moving, keep the air breathable—but
    didn’t interrupt.


    Wren kept her voice even. “You’re performing laughing. It’s different.”


    Marcus stared at the board as if it could give him directions. He felt the urge—sharp,
    reflexive—to cut her down, to teach her what this place taught everyone: don’t
    ask for sincerity on a deadline.


    Instead, he swallowed. His fingers tightened on the marker until his knuckles
    went pale.


    “You’ve been here,” Marcus said, too lightly, “what, twelve seconds? And you’re
    already doing notes on my face?”


    Wren’s expression didn’t change. “It’s not a note. It’s an observation.”


    Gary shifted. Someone rustled pages too loudly. Dana opened her mouth, closed
    it.


    Marcus’s chest pulled tight again. He could feel the edge of something he refused
    to name—like stepping up to a trapdoor and pretending it’s a stage.


    “Okay,” he said, brighter than he meant, “new rule: nobody psychoanalyzes the
    guy holding the markers. That’s like heckling the tightrope walker.”


    No one laughed this time. Not really.


    Marcus forced a grin anyway. “You’ll feel terrible when I fall.”


    He turned back to the board to write CANCEL THERAPIST LIKE AN APP — ACT BREAK.
    The red marker touched down and his hand betrayed him; the letters slanted, the
    line wobbling on the first word, as if the ink had caught on a tremor. He pressed
    harder to steady it, which only made the marker squeak—a tiny, humiliating sound
    in a room that lived on tiny sounds.


    Dana noticed. Wren noticed. Marcus pretended not to.


    Dana cleared her throat, merciful. “Okay. Runner. Neighbor’s dog. We need a button
    that pays off the dog.”


    Wren raised her hand, but her eyes stayed on Marcus, like she was offering him
    a rope without calling it that.


    “What if the dog is in the therapist’s office,” Wren said, “because the therapist
    is using it as an emotional support animal… for himself.”


    Gary laughed—real and loud. Dana laughed, too, relieved. Even from the doorway,
    Phil snorted as he returned with fresh coffee, like he’d walked'

    \nMarcus didn’t look away from the board. “Dreams do come true.”\n\nDana paced,\

    Phil’s smile tugged sideways. “Just… be decent. New people get chewed up in here.”\n\

    \ coffee like a toast, already half turning to go refill it. “It’s about what\

  content: 'Marcus Webb stood at the whiteboard like a man giving a TED Talk on drowning,
    marker poised, eyes tracking the room the way a comic tracks a heckler—ready,
    detached, already tired.


    The Los Angeles pilot-season writers’ room looked like a punchline’s autopsy:
    a horseshoe table crowded with cold Thai takeout, half-crushed LaCroix, and a
    graveyard of legal pads. The whiteboards were tiled with craft—A-story beats in
    blue, B-story in green, act breaks underlined like threats. Someone had written
    SETUP / TURN / ESCALATE / TILT in block letters and drawn a smiley face beside
    it with X’s for eyes.


    On the corner of the main board, taped low where only the person at the board
    would see it, was a tiny photo printout. Marcus at an open mic—three years ago,
    before the laugh left him. He was bent forward, hand on his stomach like he couldn’t
    breathe from it, eyes squeezed shut in a way that meant the joke had surprised
    him too. In the background: a woman’s hand mid-clap, blurred, wedding band catching
    stage light like a small flare. The edges of the photo had yellowed from being
    handled and re-taped, handled and re-taped, like a talisman that stopped working.


    Marcus tried not to look at it.


    He looked at it anyway, the way you worry a sore tooth with your tongue.


    Dana, the showrunner, snapped her fingers. “Webb. Give it to us.”


    Marcus blinked once, like he’d been yanked out of a hallway. He clicked his marker—one,
    two—like a metronome and tapped ACT TWO.


    “Okay,” he said. “Our lead finds out she’s been dating her therapist. That’s the
    twist. And the joke is not that therapy is bad—therapy is great—”


    His eyes flicked, involuntarily, to the photo.


    “—but it is awkward,” he added deadpan, “when your co-pay is emotional intimacy.”


    The room exploded the way it did when something felt clean: laughter like a burst
    pipe. Gary slapped the table hard enough to rattle a container of rice.


    “Tag!” Gary yelled, already rewriting it as he spoke. “She tries to pay with Venmo
    and it’s like: *‘For: childhood.’*”


    More laughter, louder. Someone repeated it with a different rhythm to see if it
    hit harder. Someone else scribbled it down with a little star, like it might save
    them in the edit.


    Marcus, on instinct, tossed another line without looking away from the board.
    “And the therapist requests a tip,” he said. “Suggested: twenty percent of your
    self-esteem.”


    That one got a full-body laugh from Dana—head back, eyes squeezed shut. For a
    second the room sounded like a room and not a factory.


    Marcus let the noise wash over him without entering. He wrote TAG? under the scene
    and underlined it three times. His underline was too straight, like he’d trained
    it.


    “You’re on a roll, Webb,” said Phil, the script coordinator, who carried a laptop

  “Okay,” he said. “Our lead finds out she’s been dating her therapist. That’s the
  twist. And the joke is not that therapy is bad—therapy is great—”


  His eyes flicked, involuntarily, to the photo.


  “—but it is awkward,” he added deadpan, “when your co-pay is emotional intimacy.”


  The room exploded the way it did when something felt clean: laughter like a burst
  pipe. Gary slapped the table hard enough to rattle a container of rice.


  “Tag!” Gary yelled, already rewriting it as he spoke. “She tries to pay with Venmo
  and it’s like: *‘For: childhood.’*”


  More laughter, louder. Someone repeated it with a different rhythm to see if it
  hit harder. Someone else scribbled it down with a little star, like it might save
  them in the edit.


  Marcus, on instinct, tossed another line without looking away from the board. “And
  the therapist requests a tip,” he said. “Suggested: twenty percent of your self-esteem.”


  That one got a full-body laugh from Dana—head back, eyes squeezed shut. For a second
  the room sounded like a room and not a factory.


  Marcus let the noise wash over him without entering. He wrote TAG? under the scene
  and underlined it three times. His underline was too straight, like he’d trained
  it.


  “You’re on a roll, Webb,” said Phil, the script coordinator, who carried a laptop
  and a stack of sides like a waiter in a restaurant that only served panic. “If we
  keep this up, we’ll have a draft that can be rejected by every network by Friday.”


  Marcus didn’t look away from the board. “Dreams do come true.”


  Dana paced, headset off, as if trying to remember the world before notes calls.
  Two staff writers argued quietly about whether the protagonist’s humiliating moment
  should be a spit-take or a malfunctioning bidet. (The bidet guy was losing, but
  refusing to concede on principle.)


  Phil set pages beside Marcus. “Also—Dana—network just confirmed. We’re getting a
  new writer.”


  Dana stopped. “Today?”


  Phil nodded. “They want ‘fresh perspective.’ Translation: someone under thirty who
  knows what TikTok is.”


  “We know what TikTok is,” Gary muttered. “It’s where teenagers teach you you’re
  dying wrong.”


  Marcus capped his marker. “Great. A youth. Finally, someone to explain memes to
  us as we age in real time.”


  Phil’s smile tugged sideways. “Just… be decent. New people get chewed up in here.”


  Dana pointed at the board. “Theme check,” she said, the room’s version of a prayer:
  what are we actually saying underneath the jokes?


  Phil lifted his coffee like a toast, already half turning to go refill it. “It’s
  about what makes you laugh when nobody’s watching,” he said. “Not what gets a laugh.
  What makes you laugh—”


  “Okay!” Dana clapped once, sharp, as if sincerity might bill them overtime. “Back
  to ruining joy with structure.”


  Phil shrugged and headed for the door, his line left behind like a dropped coin
  no one had time to pick up.


  A knock—hesitant, rehearsed.


  The door opened and a woman stepped in with a tote bag and a legal pad that looked
  too clean for this place. Mid-to-late twenties. Dark hair pulled back. Her eyes
  weren’t wide; they were calibrated, like she’d already learned how rooms could hurt
  you and what angles to keep.


  “Hi,” she said. “I’m Wren Park. I’m the… ‘fresh perspective.’”


  Dana crossed the room and shook her hand. “Dana. Welcome to the circus. Grab a chair.”


  Wren’s gaze swept the space: the boards, the takeout, the printed pages bracketed
  with [ALT?] and [CUT?], the way everyone sat forward as if laughter could be manufactured
  by posture. Then her eyes landed on Marcus at the board—and dropped, briefly, to
  the little photo taped low.


  She looked back up at him. Not pity. Not awe. A quick assessment that said: I see
  the bruise; I’m not going to press it just to prove I can.


  “You’re Marcus Webb,” she said, not asking.


  Marcus lifted two fingers. “Guilty. If anyone asks, I’m also thirty-four, moisturized,
  and emotionally available.”


  A couple writers laughed. Wren’s mouth curved, but she didn’t give him the satisfaction
  of a laugh.


  Dana gestured to the board. “We’re breaking Act Two. Marcus has a twist: lead’s
  been dating her therapist.”


  Wren sat, clicked her pen, and studied the blue and green lanes like they were code.
  “So the engine is she’s trying to optimize her life,” Wren said. “She’s ‘doing the
  work’—” She air-quoted without irony, which meant she’d done enough work to hate
  the phrase. “—but she’s outsourcing it.”


  Gary leaned in. “Yes. Exactly.”


  Wren nodded. “Then the joke isn’t ‘therapy is awkward.’ The joke is she thinks self-awareness
  is a subscription service.”


  Marcus felt something spark—annoying, familiar. Not joy. But recognition. She was
  good.


  He heard himself say, “So in the act break, she tries to cancel her therapist like
  an app.”


  Dana grinned. “That’s funny. Put it up.”


  Marcus uncapped the red marker to write it near ACT TWO. His hand hovered, as if
  the board had turned into a window and not a surface.


  Wren looked at him, still and direct. “You don’t laugh when you pitch,” she said.


  The room went quiet the way it does when someone accidentally names the weather.


  Marcus’s throat tightened, fast and stupid. For a second, the whiteboard glare seemed
  too bright, as if the room were exposing him on purpose. He realized he’d stopped
  breathing—his lungs held open like a punchline he couldn’t land. His jaw clenched;
  a dull ache bloomed at his molars.


  “Sure I do,” he said, the line arriving on muscle memory. “It’s just… internal.
  Like my cholesterol.”


  A few people chuckled—grateful, nervous.


  Wren didn’t laugh. “No,” she said. “That’s not it.”


  Dana gave a small, warning look—keep the room moving, keep the air breathable—but
  didn’t interrupt.


  Wren kept her voice even. “You’re performing laughing. It’s different.”


  Marcus stared at the board as if it could give him directions. He felt the urge—sharp,
  reflexive—to cut her down, to teach her what this place taught everyone: don’t ask
  for sincerity on a deadline.


  Instead, he swallowed. His fingers tightened on the marker until his knuckles went
  pale.


  “You’ve been here,” Marcus said, too lightly, “what, twelve seconds? And you’re
  already doing notes on my face?”


  Wren’s expression didn’t change. “It’s not a note. It’s an observation.”


  Gary shifted. Someone rustled pages too loudly. Dana opened her mouth, closed it.


  Marcus’s chest pulled tight again. He could feel the edge of something he refused
  to name—like stepping up to a trapdoor and pretending it’s a stage.


  “Okay,” he said, brighter than he meant, “new rule: nobody psychoanalyzes the guy
  holding the markers. That’s like heckling the tightrope walker.”


  No one laughed'
