  evidence: 'All six constraints are met: kimchi and bibimbap are used symbolically;
    David''s grief is shown through ritual (empty stool, Jesa, Wife''s recipe book)
    rather than named; Ji-woo''s estrangement has a specific cause (David missed her
    thesis show to work); Elias is a regular who embodies the neighborhood''s passage
    of time; ending is hopeful but tempered; Jesa provides a non-food Korean cultural
    element. The plan laid out character arcs and food symbolism and the final text
    follows these closely (high adherence). Story is evocative with clear beats (setup:
    demolition notice and Ji-woo''s arrival; confrontation: Ji-woo''s accusation about
    the thesis show; resolution: final night, keys handed over, David walks away),
    though the pacing is somewhat brisk, compressing emotional beats into a short
    span—hence a small deduction in narrative_quality.'
