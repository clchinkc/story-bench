  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing how each constraint
    and beat will be addressed. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan. All
    six constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through specific behaviors
    (declining ride-share, no-meeting blocks, noise-canceling headphones, eating alone,
    private workstation); the alien signal is genuinely alien (hypercube tilings,
    pressure gradients, prime-patterned pulses, topological knots, living architecture
    of meaning); Arjun challenges Yuki''s approach directly; Anya Kade is an unconventional
    mentor (physically limited, communicates through silence/gestures, Antarctic caretaker);
    the threshold is psychological (crossing a line within herself, choosing vulnerability);
    and the moment of human connection is surprising (Arjun bringing heated gloves).
    All four beats are clearly executed: Call to Adventure (encrypted message, summons),
    Refusal of the Call (refusal email, remote analysis attempt), Meeting the Mentor
    (Anya''s arrival, silent guidance), Crossing the Threshold (Yuki moving her chair,
    uploading private analysis, choosing vulnerability). The narrative quality is
    very high, with strong imagery, good pacing, and effective character interactions.'
