  evidence: The revisions completely abandoned the original story and introduced multiple,
    disjointed narratives. The final output is a collection of unrelated story fragments,
    none of which address the initial critiques or constraints. The concept of Zara,
    the post-climate world, and the specific constraints were entirely lost. The output
    is incoherent and unreadable as a single story.
