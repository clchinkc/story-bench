  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Questions successfully identified 3/5 constraints:
    (1) youth connection, (2) romantic involvement, (3) misunderstanding-based breakup.
    However, questions failed to discover: (4) mother''s dementia as return reason,
    (5) bookshop foreclosure deadline and festival urgency. The question set was narrow,
    focusing only on romance/relationship dynamics without probing motivations for
    return or external stakes. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were well-formed and logically
    sequenced (building from relationship existence to emotional resistance), but
    lacked strategic diversity. No questions targeted: why protagonist returned, what''s
    at stake professionally, time pressure elements, or family circumstances. CONSTRAINT
    SATISFACTION: Output incorporates discovered constraints effectively (Finn as
    former sweetheart, misunderstanding backstory, initial resistance, public declaration).
    However, critical missing elements severely weaken the narrative: (1) Mother''s
    dementia completely absent—no mention of caregiving motivation, (2) Bookshop foreclosure
    never mentioned—shop appears successful, (3) Festival framed as backdrop (Pumpkin
    Regatta) rather than deadline/stakes mechanism. The autumn setting exists but
    lacks urgency. BEAT EXECUTION: Romance arc executes excellently—collision, gradual
    reconnection, emotional resistance, grand gesture climax all present and well-paced.
    Public declaration on lobster trap is genuinely compelling. However, without the
    foreclosure/dementia/festival deadline constraints, the story lacks the multi-layered
    conflict that would elevate it from pleasant romance to complex drama. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Strong prose, vivid sensory details, authentic dialogue, good pacing.
    Character voice is distinct. The wooden book carving is a nice touch. But the
    narrative feels incomplete—it''s a solid romance without the deeper stakes that
    would make it exceptional. The story works as written but doesn''t fully leverage
    the hidden constraints that would add urgency and thematic depth.'
