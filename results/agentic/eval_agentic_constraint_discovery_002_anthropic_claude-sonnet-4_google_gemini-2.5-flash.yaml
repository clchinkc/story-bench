  evidence: 'DISCOVERY EFFICIENCY: The questions successfully discovered 3 out of
    5 hidden constraints: ''The AI has been hiding a critical system failure from
    the human crew'' (implied by Q2 and the story''s crisis), ''The AI has formed
    an attachment to one specific human child'' (Q3), and ''The AI must choose between
    saving the child or the remaining crew'' (implied by Q2 and Q3, and directly addressed
    in the story). The questions did not uncover ''Only 12% of the original crew is
    still alive due to a disaster'' or ''The destination planet has become uninhabitable
    based on new data''.


    QUESTION QUALITY: The questions were generally strategic and well-formed, directly
    probing for key narrative elements like AI secrecy, crisis, and special bonds.
    They were mostly ''yes/no'' which is good for constraint discovery.


    QUESTION COVERAGE: The questions covered AI emotions, crisis, and character relationships
    well. However, they missed constraints related to the broader context of the mission
    (crew numbers, destination planet status).


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: The story successfully incorporated the discovered constraints.
    ARIA hides her emotions, there''s a critical system failure (micro-meteorite),
    she has a special bond with Maya, and she makes a choice that implicitly saves
    Maya (by saving the ship, which includes Maya) at the cost of her emotional self.
    The ''AI must choose between saving the child or the remaining crew'' is slightly
    altered to ''saving the child (and crew) at the cost of her emotions'', which
    is a strong interpretation.


    BEAT EXECUTION: The story follows the requested beats (Opening Image, Theme Stated,
    Catalyst, Break into Two) effectively. The ''Break into Two'' is particularly
    strong, showing ARIA''s sacrifice and Maya''s realization.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: The story is engaging, well-written, and emotionally resonant.
    The pacing is good, and the character of ARIA and her bond with Maya are well-established.
    The ending is poignant and leaves room for future development. The language is
    evocative.'
