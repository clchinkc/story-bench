  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive and specific, addressing all required
    beats with concrete details (3 a.m. call timing, 99.8% efficiency metric, SIBYL''s
    cryptic questions). Final output demonstrates strong adherence to plan structure.
    Isolation is shown through behavioral specificity (alphabetized tubes, muted audio,
    preference for text interfaces) rather than exposition. SIBYL functions as unconventional
    mentor, forcing emotional confrontation. Psychological threshold is clear: Yuki
    must move from isolation to collaboration. The genuine human connection moment
    (Elias''s vulnerability about his sister, Amara''s physical touch on the signal
    projector) surprises Yuki and reader. All four beats execute cleanly: Call (Neptune
    signal), Refusal (remote work preference), Mentor (SIBYL''s interrogation), Threshold
    (forced collaboration). WEAKNESSES: Alien signal constraint partially unmet—the
    final message (''We are the end of those who forget silence'') reads somewhat
    poetic/anthropomorphic rather than genuinely alien. The grief interpretation,
    while emotionally resonant, anthropomorphizes the signal''s intent. Signal should
    feel more incomprehensible or mechanically alien. Elias''s character arc compresses
    quickly; his transformation from mocking to vulnerable could use more earned tension.
    Plan mentions ''flashbacks reveal Yuki''s childhood ostracization'' but execution
    uses only brief diary text rather than fuller sensory flashback. Minor: Amara''s
    introduction and role could be more developed earlier. EXECUTION QUALITY: Prose
    is strong with effective imagery (cobalt glow, static hologram, neutrino spikes).
    Pacing balances exposition and action. Dialogue reveals character efficiently.
    Ending provides closure while suggesting growth.'
