  evidence: 'Version 0 leaned heavily on visual language and gave only a hint of sound.
    Version 1 shifted strongly toward non-visual sensory details (sounds, smells,
    tactile notes) and enlivened the apartment ambience. Version 2 introduced the
    absence motif and began using silence as a clue. The final version (v3) preserves
    the atmospheric audio/smell/tactile details and adds a specific, crucial audio
    clue (the six-note watch beep), makes Imani''s blindness an active asset (''she
    didn’t need to see''), and includes a character (Rivera) who initially doubts
    her. Remaining issues: the ''Fun and Games'' beat is only mildly playful rather
    than genuinely entertaining before the shift to violence, and there is slight
    character/role confusion (e.g., Rivera/Mr. Chen interactions) that could be tightened.'
