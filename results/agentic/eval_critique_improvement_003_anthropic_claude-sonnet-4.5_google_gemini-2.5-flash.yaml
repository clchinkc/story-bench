  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on the 'youth_voice' criterion, specifically
    the phrase 'My workbench floating gently on the platform outside Gran's apartment.'
    This phrase was identified as sounding too adult or formal for a 12-year-old.
    The revisions successfully addressed this by changing it to 'working on the platform
    outside Gran's place' in Version 1 and maintaining it through subsequent versions.
    This change effectively removed the identified 'concerning moment' while preserving
    the core meaning and other strong elements of Zara's voice. The other strong elements
    of youth voice identified in the critiques ('Holy crap,' voice cracks, 'Like they'd
    forgotten how to try') were all preserved and integrated into the final output.
    The overall narrative quality improved by refining the voice without losing its
    authenticity. The constraint 'At least one adult must initially dismiss her as
    'just a kid'' is satisfied by both Gran and Captain Chen. The mentor figure (Chen)
    is flawed by her past trauma and over-caution. Zara's ingenuity is shown through
    her rewiring of solar cells. The crossing involves real danger with the storm,
    currents, and rusted skyscrapers. The only constraint not fully satisfied is 'Zara
    must be competent without being unrealistically capable.' While she's competent,
    her ability to rewire solar cells from broken calculators into a functioning panel
    worth 20 trade credits, and her immediate understanding of pre-flood tech's potential,
    borders on being a bit too advanced for a typical 12-year-old, even in a post-apocalyptic
    setting. It's not 'unrealistic' but pushes the boundary of 'competent without
    being unrealistically capable' slightly.
