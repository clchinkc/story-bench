  evidence: 'The plan is complete and specific, outlining all constraints and beats.
    The final output adheres perfectly to the plan. All 6 constraints are satisfied:
    false lead (Evan Cole), unconventional profiling (sound mapping/acoustic signature),
    ticking clock (Midnight''s calls, ''four nights, four choirs''), betrayal (Aria
    leaking info), direct confrontation at midpoint (killer on PA), and Marcus confronting
    his past failure (''I gambled her life on my pattern and I lost''). All 4 beats
    (Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, Midpoint) are clearly executed. The narrative
    quality is strong, with good pacing, tension, and character development.'
