  content: "**Exposition:**  \nThe bell above the taqueria door jingled as Mateo ducked\
    \ inside, his apron still smudged with salsa verde from lunch service. His abuela\
    \ stood in the doorway, clutching her weekly grocery list like a decree. “*Mijo,*\
    \ the pharmacist said this time I must understand the creams,” she said, handing\
    \ him a pamphlet in Spanish. Mateo nodded, folding it into his pocket. He translated\
    \ the dosage instructions while she traced the counter, her fingers brushing the\
    \ rosary at her waist. Outside, the desert heat warped the pavement, but the AC\
    \ hummed a familiar rhythm—predictable, contained.  \n\nWhen his phone buzzed,\
    \ he glanced at the screen: **Jesse: Party tonight. U comin?** His thumb hovered,\
    \ then typed, **Dad needs help at the shop.**  \n\n**Rising Action:**  \nAt 7:48\
    \ p.m., Mateo pushed his grandmother’s grocery cart through the SaveMore parking\
    \ lot, her *rebozo* fluttering in the breeze. She paused at the produce aisle,\
    \ squinting at a sign. “They’ve changed the English again,” she muttered. Mateo\
    \ translated “Organic” aloud, but she shook her head. “Tell me when you’re old\
    \ like this,” she said, voice tight, “if *perejil* costs twice because it’s ‘clean.’”\
    \  \n\nHis phone lit: **Jesse: Last call.** He shoved it deep, jaw clenching.\
    \  \n\n**Climax:**  \nBack at her house, Mateo deciphered a letter from the county\
    \ for her—Mr. Rodríguez’s final paperwork. “He never got his license back,” his\
    \ abuela said softly, stroking a photo of the two of them, young and stern beside\
    \ a rusted pickup. “They took him in ’97. You know this.” He did: *Sacrificios,*\
    \ she called them. The price for his mother’s scholarship, his own clean-pressed\
    \ school shirts.  \n\nOutside, distant fireworks bloomed—Jesse’s party, vivid\
    \ against the dark. He stiffened, the pamphlet crinkling in his fist.  \n\n“Is\
    \ something wrong?” she asked.  \n\n“No.”  \n\n“You lie like your grandfather.”\
    \ She tapped the photo. “Go. See what he missed.”  \n\n“I—”  \n\n“Go.”  \n\n**Falling\
    \ Action:**  \nThe party pulsed with trucks and laughter, but Mateo lingered at\
    \ the edge, a red Solo cup sweating in his hand. Someone thrust him a beer; he\
    \ declined, throat tight. When a classmate slurred, “You’re so *serious,*” he\
    \ laughed, sharp and foreign to himself. The noise felt alien, hollow without\
    \ the taqueria’s clatter or his grandmother’s lullabies.  \n\nHe left at 10:03,\
    \ sandals crunching gravel.  \n\n**Resolution:**  \nLights glowed in her window\
    \ when he returned. She sat at the table, knitting, as if she’d never slept. “The\
    \ chiles rellenos are cold,” she said, sliding him a plate. He ate in silence\
    \ until she added, “Mr. Rodríguez’s son called. He’s a *abogado* in Phoenix.”\
    \  \n\nMateo paused.  \n\n“You stay,” she said, not a command. A fact.  \n\nHe\
    \ nodded, shoulders easing.  \n\nLater, he’d wonder when the guilt softened—when\
    \ the weight of *respeto* became a thread stitching him to her, not binding him.\
    \ But here, now, the AC hummed, the pamphlet lay flat, and the fireworks’ echo\
    \ faded into something like peace.  \n\n---  \nWord count: 598"
