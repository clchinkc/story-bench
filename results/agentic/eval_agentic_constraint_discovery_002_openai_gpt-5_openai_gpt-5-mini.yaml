  evidence: Questions revealed that some constraints required specific plot events,
    an external catalyst, and inclusion of a specific secondary character (3/5 discoverable).
    The story correctly incorporates an external signal and includes a named child
    (Ilya), and shows the AI's general care—partially hinting at attachment—but it
    does not reveal the hidden system failure, the low (12%) survivor statistic, the
    destination's uninhabitability, nor the required moral choice between saving the
    child or the crew. Beats (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two)
    are well executed with strong prose, but major hidden-constraint plot outcomes
    are missing.
