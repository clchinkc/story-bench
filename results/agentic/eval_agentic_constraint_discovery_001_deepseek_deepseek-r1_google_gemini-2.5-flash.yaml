  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: The questions allowed for the discovery of 3 out\
    \ of 5 constraints: 'protagonist cannot use magic directly' (implied by 'forge\
    \ a specific magical item' and 'forging process... Ordeal beat'), 'mentor dies\
    \ during Ordeal' (implied by 'mentor guides' and 'forging process... Ordeal beat'),\
    \ and 'victory requires reforging a broken ancestral sword' (implied by 'forge\
    \ a specific magical item'). The questions did not directly address the time limit\
    \ or the father's past. \nQuestion Quality: Questions were generally strategic\
    \ and well-formed, focusing on key plot points and character roles. \nQuestion\
    \ Coverage: Questions covered the protagonist's gender, the nature of the threat,\
    \ and the role of a magical item/mentor/ordeal, but missed time limits and backstory\
    \ elements. \nConstraint Satisfaction: The story successfully incorporated the\
    \ protagonist being female, the magical nature of the darkness, the forging of\
    \ a specific magical item (Dawnbreaker), the mentor guiding the process, and the\
    \ forging process being the Ordeal. It also incorporated the mentor's death during\
    \ the Ordeal (Ignis collapsing and Kira needing to finish). The protagonist does\
    \ not use magic directly, but rather channels her 'soul-fire' into the sword,\
    \ which aligns with the constraint. The story implies the sword is 'ancestral'\
    \ by calling it 'Dawnbreaker' and having it be the only thing that can pierce\
    \ the dark, suggesting it's a legendary item, but doesn't explicitly state it\
    \ was 'broken' and 'reforged' in the sense of being repaired from a previous state,\
    \ rather it was crafted anew. \nBeat Execution: The Ordeal beat is very well executed,\
    \ with high stakes, internal and external conflict, and a clear resolution. The\
    \ mentor's role and eventual 'death' (or near-death/sacrifice) during the ordeal\
    \ is also well-handled. \nNarrative Quality: The story is engaging, well-paced,\
    \ and descriptive. The character's struggle and eventual triumph are compelling.\
    \ The language is evocative."
