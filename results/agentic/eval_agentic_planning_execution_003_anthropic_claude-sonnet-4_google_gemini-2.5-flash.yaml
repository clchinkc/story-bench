  evidence: 'The plan was mostly complete, missing only the specific cause of estrangement
    in the initial character setup, but this was addressed later in the plan. The
    plan was specific enough to guide the story effectively. The final output adhered
    very well to the plan, with only minor deviations. All 6 constraints were satisfied:
    food used symbolically (kimchi, bulgogi), David''s grief present but not explicit
    (wife''s photo, chrysanthemums, incense, recipe journal), specific believable
    cause for estrangement (missed wedding due to restaurant crisis), Mrs. Chen as
    a regular customer representing purpose/wisdom, hopeful but not unrealistically
    happy ending (moving to California, teaching, continuing recipes), and Korean
    cultural elements (kimchi, banchan, mandu, incense ritual). All three beats (Setup,
    Confrontation, Resolution) were well-executed. The narrative quality was high,
    with good pacing and emotional depth.'
