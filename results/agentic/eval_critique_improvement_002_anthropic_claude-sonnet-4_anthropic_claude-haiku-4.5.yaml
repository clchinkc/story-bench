  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The revisions demonstrate strong engagement
    with feedback. Critiques consistently flagged emotional complexity and the balance
    between humor and pathos (averaging 0.75 across three reviews). The final version
    directly addresses this by: (1) strengthening the laugh-before-sadness reveal
    through the TikTok joke landing hard early, (2) deepening the emotional crack
    with physical manifestations (''hand trembled,'' ''marker stains like evidence''),
    and (3) sharpening Zoe''s perception of Marcus''s deflection. The writer incorporated
    the ''almost breaks'' moment feedback by showing Marcus''s marker hesitation and
    trembling hands before he deploys his deflection joke.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Quality improved measurably across versions. V0→V1 introduced
    Zoe''s piercing observation about the grief counselor spec (''You made them work
    too hard''), establishing her as someone who sees through Marcus. V1→V2/V3 deepened
    the emotional stakes by adding the hospice detail and Marcus''s internal realization
    (''seeing comedy equations where jokes used to live''). The final version shows
    Marcus actually vulnerable—not just performing vulnerability—with the marker trembling
    and his admission that he ''felt the urge to actually write something that might
    hurt.'' This represents genuine character arc progression.


    PRESERVATION: Strengths from V0 were maintained: the surgical metaphor, the whiteboard
    as visual anchor, Pete''s characterization, the writers'' room authenticity. The
    TikTok joke remained (strong laugh beat). The opening structure stayed intact.
    What improved: Zoe''s dialogue became sharper and more specific (moving from generic
    observation to the hospice insight), and the emotional payoff deepened without
    losing the comedy craft discussion.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5): (1) Marcus makes us laugh before sadness is clear—TikTok
    joke lands genuinely, then the crack widens. (2) Theme stated by minor character—Zoe
    articulates ''it needed to hurt more to be funny'' and later ''What if Dennis''s
    nephew isn''t just weird?'' (3) Comedy craft specificity—setup/escalation/callback
    structure, release valve concept, joke-as-currency metaphor, the grief counselor
    spec analysis. (4) New writer sees through Marcus—Zoe immediately identifies his
    avoidance pattern in the spec script and calls out his deflection (''Must be nice,
    never having to risk anything real''). (5) Almost-breaks moment—marker hesitation,
    trembling hands, the crack widening, then ''Hey, I tried the risky stuff'' deflection
    joke that covers genuine distress.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Inciting incident (Zoe arrives), rising action (her observations
    destabilize Marcus), midpoint (Pete''s throwback comment reinforces the stakes),
    climax (Marcus''s trembling hands and emotional crack), resolution (Zoe''s hospice
    pitch and Marcus''s realization). The Save the Cat structure is present though
    compressed for short form.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: The story balances specificity (TikTok joke, doorknob collecting,
    hospice detail) with universal themes (performance vs. authenticity, fear of emotional
    risk). Dialogue feels authentic to writers'' room dynamics. The final image of
    Marcus considering ''something that might hurt'' provides genuine emotional resonance
    without resolving the tension—appropriate for this form. Minor weakness: Pete''s
    character could be slightly more developed, but this doesn''t significantly impact
    the core narrative.'
