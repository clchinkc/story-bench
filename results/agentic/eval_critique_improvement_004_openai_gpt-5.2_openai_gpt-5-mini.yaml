  evidence: 'Early critiques praised Teddy''s interiority; revisions preserved and
    amplified that interior life (examples: repeated pocket-patting, the empty hook
    for Lena, the thermos/ritual timing). The final version adds the construction
    disruption and a concrete alternate path (the alley) that yields new social contact
    (Mara, Devon) and forces Teddy into interaction—fulfilling the constraint about
    the new path offering what the old couldn''t (connection vs. isolation). Sensory
    specifics (kettle click, sidewalk sounds, smell of alley, sunflowers in a paint
    bucket) increase show-don''t-tell subtlety. Weakness: the Story Circle arc is
    only partly resolved—the story sets up You/Need/Go/Search/Find beats but cuts
    off before a clear Take/Return/Change; the ending is abrupt (sentence trailing
    off), which lowers beat execution and overall polish.'
