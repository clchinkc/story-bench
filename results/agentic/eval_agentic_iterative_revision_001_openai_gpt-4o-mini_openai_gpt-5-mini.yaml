  evidence: 'Early versions (V0–V2) were truncated and merely established Elena''s
    competence in a hectic hospital setting. By Version 3 and the Final output the
    prose is expanded and polished: the initial image of competence (clipboard, orchestration
    of staff, respect) is preserved, then a clear flaw (gnawing loneliness, overwork)
    is introduced. The friendship with Dr. Malik is made explicit and feels earned
    through prior familiarity, warm dialogue, and a shared confidant moment over coffee.
    A specific medical detail — ''flu season'' with overflowing waiting rooms and
    dwindling resources — drives the plot conflict and grounds the story in a realistic
    clinical pressure. Elena''s change is shown as internal (a ''small shift within''
    and questions about balancing duties and desires), not external, and the ending
    leaves ambiguity (''Had she truly changed...''), satisfying the required ambiguous
    close. Overall quality rose from incomplete drafts to a cohesive scene that preserves
    initial strengths while adding emotional beats; minor weakness: the friendship
    and internal turn are somewhat compressed and could be deepened further for maximal
    impact.'
