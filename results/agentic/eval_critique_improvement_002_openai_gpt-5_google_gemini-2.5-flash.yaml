  evidence: The revisions consistently improved the emotional complexity and constraint
    satisfaction. The initial versions were good, but the final version truly nailed
    the balance of humor and pathos, and the specific constraints. For instance, the
    'almost breaks but covers with a joke' moment was subtly integrated and impactful
    in the final version, building on earlier attempts. The theme statement by a minor
    character (Drea) was also refined to be more natural and impactful. The craft
    of comedy writing was evident throughout, and Elena's character was consistently
    portrayed as perceptive, not naive. The humor was preserved and even enhanced
    with each iteration, while the underlying sadness of Marcus became more poignant.
