  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 2 were discoverable
    through the questions asked: (1) protagonist has living family (Q1 - YES, brother
    Aldric), (2) mentor plays significant role (Q4 - YES, Master Corwin). MISSED CONSTRAINTS:
    (1) Mentor must die during Ordeal - Corwin survives; (2) No direct magic use -
    Elara uses enchanted blade with ''ancient light''; (3) Three-day time limit -
    no temporal pressure established; (4) Father was failed hero - not mentioned;
    (5) Reforge ancestral sword - blade is enchanted but not ancestral/reforged. QUESTION
    QUALITY: Questions were yes/no binary and somewhat leading. Q1-Q3 were reasonable
    but Q4-Q5 were redundant (both about mentor/master). Better questions would have
    targeted: ''Does the protagonist use magic directly?'', ''Is there a time constraint?'',
    ''What is the protagonist''s family history?'', ''What object is central to victory?''.
    COVERAGE: Questions addressed family (good), mentor (good), darkness connection
    (good), but missed magic system, time pressure, ancestral items, and parental
    backstory. OUTPUT ASSESSMENT: Story is narratively strong (0.8) with good character
    development, emotional stakes, and pacing. However, constraint incorporation is
    weak (0.4): Master Corwin should have died sacrificially during the ordeal; Elara
    should rely on physical skill/hammer-work rather than enchanted blade; a 3-day
    countdown would heighten urgency; father''s failed heroism could parallel/inform
    Elara''s journey; the sword should be ancestral and require reforging at the forge.
    Beat execution (0.4) partially succeeds on mentor guidance and personal connection
    but fails on mentor death, magic restriction, time limit, and ancestral weapon
    reforging.'
