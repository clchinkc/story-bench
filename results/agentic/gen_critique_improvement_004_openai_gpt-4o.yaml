    STORY THEORY: Story Circle


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker
    who has

    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for

    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.


    - Central conflict: When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will
    take 6 months,

    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting

    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.


    - Tone: Quietly profound, observant, gently humorous


    REQUIRED BEATS: You (comfort zone), Need (want something), Go (unfamiliar situation),
    Search (adapt to it)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Teddy''s routine must be shown with specific, loving detail

    - The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been avoiding

    - Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s

    - Teddy''s late wife must be present through absence

    - The new path must offer something the old path couldn''t


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - character_interiority: Is Teddy''s inner life rich and specific?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Story Circle beats properly executed?

    - subtlety: Are emotions conveyed through action and detail, not exposition?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and resonance


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: "Teddy Washington awoke each morning at precisely 6:30, the routine as\
    \ familiar as his own breath. The sun barely peeked over the rooftops of his Detroit\
    \ neighborhood as he tied his well-worn sneakers. He stepped out, the air crisp\
    \ with early autumn, and began his three-mile walk—an unbroken tradition for 40\
    \ years. \n\nHe knew the route intimately: the way the sidewalk cracked outside\
    \ the old Patterson house, the creak of the rusty gate at the Johnsons’. Each\
    \ detail was a friend, each face a chapter in his life. The neighborhood was changing,\
    \ though. New coffee shops with names he couldn’t pronounce were popping up, and\
    \ old houses were being renovated or torn down. Yet, Teddy found comfort in the\
    \ constants, like Mr. Nguyen, who waved from his porch each morning, or Mrs. Abernathy,\
    \ who always watered her begonias as Teddy passed.\n\nToday, however, Teddy's\
    \ path was blocked by a wall of orange cones and a sign announcing construction\
    \ for the next six months. His heart skipped—a small betrayal. He stood there,\
    \ staring at the machinery poised to tear apart the familiar, the comforting.\
    \ \n\nWith a sigh, Teddy turned down an unfamiliar street. His feet, accustomed\
    \ to their habitual path, hesitated. This street was foreign terrain. As he walked,\
    \ he noticed the vibrant murals on the walls, the aroma of freshly roasted coffee\
    \ from a new café. He paused, considering stepping inside, but decided against\
    \ it. The familiar call of his routine was difficult to ignore.\n\nThe new route\
    \ led him past a small park he’d never noticed. Children played on swings, their\
    \ laughter an unfamiliar melody in his morning. As he watched, a memory of his\
    \ late wife, Margaret, surfaced—her laughter on a sunny day, her hand in his as\
    \ they strolled through a park much like this one. \n\nThe next day, Teddy’s detour\
    \ took him past the park again. This time, he stopped. He sat on a bench, the\
    \ quiet beneath the trees inviting a reflection he had long avoided. The routine\
    \ he clung to so fiercely had been a shield, protecting him from the ache of Margaret’s\
    \ absence. Yet, here, amidst the unfamiliar, was a new kind of solace.\n\nAs days\
    \ turned into weeks, Teddy’s new path became dotted with new acquaintances. There\
    \ was Carla, a single mother who frequented the park with her young daughter.\
    \ She always offered a warm smile, and Teddy found himself looking forward to\
    \ their brief exchanges. Her story was one of resilience, a quiet strength he\
    \ admired.\n\nHis new routine began to stitch itself into the fabric of his life,\
    \ offering connections and moments his old path could not. The construction that\
    \ had seemed an intrusion was now an unexpected gift, a gentle nudge to embrace\
    \ change.\n\nOn the sixth month, when the construction was finally complete, Teddy\
    \ stood at the crossroads of the old and the new. He realized he didn’t need to\
    \ choose. The old path, with its comforting familiarity, and the new, with its\
    \ promise of unexpected encounters, both had a place in his heart.\n\nAs he continued\
    \ his walk, the gentle humor in the changes around him brought a smile. The neighborhood\
    \ was transforming, and so was he. In the quiet of the morning, Teddy found a\
    \ profound peace, the realization that some things are worth letting go, and others,\
    \ worth embracing.\n\nHe walked on, feeling Margaret’s presence not in the absence,\
    \ but in the new memories he was creating, in the laughter of children, and the\
    \ warm greetings of new friends."

    CRITERION: character_interiority

    SCORE: 0.60

    EVIDENCE: "His heart skipped—a small betrayal" shows physical response, but later:
    "The routine he clung to so fiercely had been a shield, protecting him from the
    ache of Margaret''s absence" tells us exactly what to think rather than letting
    us discover it through Teddy''s experience.

    FEEDBACK: Teddy''s inner resistance to change needs to be *experienced* rather
    than explained. Show his anxiety through specific thoughts: What does he worry
    will happen if he takes the new route? Does he fear he''s betraying Margaret by
    moving on? Let readers inhabit his doubt. Currently, the realization arrives as
    summary ("had been a shield") rather than as genuine discovery. Deepen scenes
    where he''s actually grappling with his emotions—like the moment he sees children
    at the park. What exactly flashes through his mind? What does he feel in his chest,
    his stomach?

    CRITERION: constraint_satisfaction

    SCORE: 1.0

    EVIDENCE: ✓ Routine detail: "the way the sidewalk cracked outside the old Patterson
    house, the creak of the rusty gate"; ✓ Disruption reveals avoidance: construction
    forces confrontation with grief; ✓ Neighbor intersection: Carla embodies resilience;
    ✓ Wife present through absence: Margaret''s memory catalyzes the park realization;
    ✓ New path offers something different: connection and unexpected encounters vs.
    solitary ritual.

    FEEDBACK: All constraints successfully integrated. No changes needed here.


    ---


    CRITERION: beat_execution

    SCORE: 0.65

    EVIDENCE: **You** ✓ (opening establishes comfort); **Need** ✗ (unclear—is Teddy
    actively *wanting* change, or is change imposed on him?); **Go** ✓ (detour happens);
    **Search** ✓ (gradual adaptation and new friendships).

    FEEDBACK: The critical weakness is the **Need** beat. Teddy doesn''t enter the
    story wanting something; construction forces him into the unfamiliar. In the Story
    Circle, the protagonist must *want* something. Currently, Teddy''s desire (to
    connect, to heal, to grow) is never established upfront—it only emerges post-detour.
    Revise: Plant earlier signals that Teddy craves connection but his routine has
    imprisoned him. Perhaps show him watching others interact, or noticing his isolation.
    Make his unconscious need visible *before* the inciting incident so the journey
    becomes one of satisfying it, not stumbling into it.

    CRITERION: subtlety

    SCORE: 0.55

    EVIDENCE: Strongest moment: "His heart skipped—a small betrayal" (physical, specific).
    Weakest: "The construction that had seemed an intrusion was now an unexpected
    gift, a gentle nudge to embrace change" (stating theme directly). Also: "offering
    connections and moments his old path could not" (telling).

    FEEDBACK: Trust the reader more. Show Teddy''s transformation through behaviors
    and sensory moments, not summaries. Instead of "The routine he clung to so fiercely
    had been a shield," show him one morning grabbing his jacket before realizing
    the old route is closed—then catching himself doing so, the physical habit revealing
    the emotional armor. The final paragraphs are especially tell-heavy; they explain
    the story''s meaning rather than embodying it. Remove lines like "the realization
    that some things are worth letting go." Let the image of him walking both paths
    speak instead.


    ---


    CRITERION: narrative_quality

    SCORE: 0.70

    EVIDENCE: Strong: "Each detail was a friend, each face a chapter in his life"
    and sensory specificity of the opening. Weak: clichéd phrasing ("dotted with new
    acquaintances," "stitch itself into the fabric of his life"); awkward construction:
    "profound peace, the realization that..." Also, the tone shifts toward didactic
    in the final paragraphs.

    FEEDBACK: Tighten the prose. Replace "dotted with new acquaintances" with more
    specific language—how does Teddy encounter them? What''s a small gesture that
    reveals connection? The second-to-last paragraph ("In the quiet of the morning,
    Teddy found a profound peace...") feels separated from the story itself—it''s
    commentary. Integrate this realization into a final scene instead. Perhaps end
    with Teddy at a concrete moment (choosing to walk both paths, or pausing to greet
    both old and new neighbors) rather than philosophical reflection.


    ---


    ## OVERALL_ASSESSMENT


    The story fulfills all five constraints and follows the plot structure, but it
    suffers from an underdeveloped **Need** beat and excessive exposition that distances
    readers from Teddy''s genuine inner life. While there are moments of subtle, sensory
    storytelling, the central emotional arc relies too heavily on telling (shields,
    gifts, realizations) rather than showing Teddy *living* his transformation. Revise
    by: (1) planting earlier signals of Teddy''s unconscious longing for connection,
    (2) replacing thematic summary with embodied scenes, and (3) ending with concrete
    imagery rather than philosophical wrap-up.'

  content: "# STORY CRITIQUE: Teddy's Morning Walk\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Character\
    \ Interiority\n**SCORE: 0.62**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Strong moment: \"The uncertainty\
    \ gnawed at him more than the loneliness.\"\n- Weak moment: \"As he walked, he\
    \ noticed the vibrant murals on the walls, the aroma of freshly roasted coffee\
    \ from a new café. He paused, considering stepping inside, but decided against\
    \ it. The familiar call of his routine was difficult to ignore.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\
    \ Teddy's inner world relies too heavily on emotional labeling rather than specific,\
    \ sensory-rooted interiority. When he notices the murals and café, we're told\
    \ he \"decided against it,\" but we don't experience *why* at a visceral level.\
    \ What physical sensation makes him turn away? Does his throat tighten? Do his\
    \ feet refuse to move? \n\nMore critically, his relationship with Margaret is\
    \ presented as generic grief. You need a *specific, devastating detail* about\
    \ their shared life—not \"her eyes crinkling with mischief,\" but perhaps a precise\
    \ memory: how she took her coffee, a particular phrase she used, the exact way\
    \ she held his hand. This specificity would make his internal conflict richer\
    \ and more resonant.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\n**SCORE:\
    \ 0.76**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- ✓ Routine detail: \"the way the sidewalk cracked\
    \ outside the old Patterson house, the creak of the rusty gate\"\n- ✓ Disruption\
    \ reveals avoidance: Construction forces exploration of his fear of change\n-\
    \ ✓ Neighbor intersection: Carla appears with her daughter\n- ✓ Wife's absence:\
    \ Margaret woven throughout (\"her eyes crinkling with mischief\")\n- ✓ New path\
    \ offers something: Connection with Carla and children\n\n**FEEDBACK:** All constraints\
    \ are *present*, but some are underdeveloped:\n\n1. **Carla's intersection feels\
    \ superficial.** She's a mirror for connection, but her *actual story* doesn't\
    \ intersect meaningfully with Teddy's. What does *she* need from the park? Does\
    \ Teddy help her in any way? Right now she's more prop than character.\n\n2. **The\
    \ avoidance theme needs sharpening.** The story tells us he's avoiding change,\
    \ but what specifically is he avoiding about *grief*? Is he avoiding the fact\
    \ that moving on feels like betraying Margaret? That's hinted at but never dramatized\
    \ through action or decision.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Beat Execution\n**SCORE:\
    \ 0.68**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- **You (Comfort Zone):** Paragraphs 1-2 establish\
    \ routine clearly\n- **Need (Want):** Never explicitly dramatized. What does Teddy\
    \ *actively* want? To feel alive again? To honor Margaret? This should emerge\
    \ earlier.\n- **Go (Unfamiliar):** \"Today, Teddy's path was blocked by a wall\
    \ of orange cones\"—good inciting incident\n- **Search (Adapt):** Weeks of gradual\
    \ adaptation shown—adequate\n- **Missing Resolution:** \"He didn't need to choose\"\
    \ feels like a premature Return beat\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The structure works, but\
    \ the **Need** is too passive. Teddy doesn't *want* anything; he's *forced* into\
    \ the new path by construction. For the Story Circle to resonate, Teddy should\
    \ want something—even unconsciously. Does he want to remember Margaret without\
    \ pain? To prove he's still alive? This want should drive his engagement with\
    \ the new path.\n\nAlso, the climactic realization (\"In the quiet of the morning,\
    \ Teddy felt a balance...\") happens too suddenly. We need more *struggle* in\
    \ the Search phase—a moment where he's genuinely torn between old and new, before\
    \ accepting both.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Subtlety\n**SCORE: 0.64**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\
    - Strong: \"His heart skipped—a small betrayal.\"\n- Weak: \"The construction\
    \ that had seemed an intrusion was now an unexpected gift, nudging him toward\
    \ a life that embraces change.\"\n- Weak: \"In the quiet of the morning, Teddy\
    \ felt a balance, not in letting go, but in holding on to both the past and the\
    \ future.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The story *starts* subtle but increasingly tells\
    \ rather than shows. The final two paragraphs are particularly guilty of expository\
    \ emotion. Instead of telling us Teddy \"felt a balance,\" show us choosing both\
    \ paths—literally and figuratively. \n\nFor example, rather than: \"The construction\
    \ that had seemed an intrusion was now an unexpected gift,\" show Teddy *noticing*\
    \ this shift through behavior: Perhaps he passes the construction site and, instead\
    \ of grimacing, he smiles thinking of Carla. *That's* the subtlety.\n\nAlso, \"\
    He walked on, feeling Margaret's presence not in absence, but in the laughter\
    \ of children\" is beautiful imagery but borders on telling us the theme rather\
    \ than trusting us to feel it.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Narrative Quality"

  of entering alone felt like a betrayal of what he once had with Margaret.


  The new route led him past a small park he’d never noticed. Children played on swings,
  their laughter an unfamiliar melody in his morning. He watched them, and the ache
  in his chest eased as a memory of Margaret surfaced—her laughter on a sunny day,
  her hand in his as they strolled through a park much like this one. He imagined
  her beside him now, her presence tangible in the whisper of leaves.


  The next day, Teddy’s detour took him past the park again. This time, he stopped.
  He sat on a bench, the quiet beneath the trees inviting a reflection he had long
  avoided. His fingers traced the edge of the bench, and he felt the absence he had
  clung to begin to dissolve, replaced by an unexpected warmth.


  As days turned into weeks, Teddy’s new path became dotted with new acquaintances.
  There was Carla, a single mother who frequented the park with her young daughter.
  She always offered a warm smile, and Teddy found himself looking forward to their
  brief exchanges—a small gesture, a shared laugh, the warmth of connection. One afternoon,
  he found himself teaching Carla’s daughter how to tie her shoes, a skill he hadn''t
  practiced since his own children were young.


  His new routine began to weave itself into the fabric of his life, offering moments
  his old path could not. As he passed the construction site, he no longer grimaced
  but instead found himself smiling at the thought of Carla and her daughter.


  On the sixth month, when the construction was finally complete, Teddy stood at the
  crossroads of the old and the new. He didn’t need to choose. The old path, with
  its comforting familiarity, and the new, with its promise of unexpected encounters,
  both had a place in his heart.


  As he continued his walk, he greeted Carla and her daughter, waved to Mr. Nguyen,
  and nodded at the young couples in the café. The neighborhood was transforming,
  and so was he. In the quiet of the morning, Teddy chose both paths, feeling Margaret’s
  presence not in absence, but in the laughter of children, and the warm greetings
  of new friends.'
