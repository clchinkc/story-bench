  content: 'Write a story with the following requirements:


    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

    Marcus Webb stared at the whiteboard like a surgeon studying an X-ray of something
    terminal. The joke structure was clean—setup, misdirect, punch—but clean wasn''t
    funny. Clean was a C+ from a network note that read "Could we make the dad more
    relatable?"


    "What if he says ''That''s what she said'' but ironically?" offered Danny, their
    staff writer, through a mouthful of pad thai.


    "Brilliant. Very 2008. Very nostalgic," Marcus said. "We could also have him do
    the Macarena. Really lean into the throwback thing."


    The room laughed. Marcus didn''t. He hadn''t laughed—really laughed, the kind
    that came from somewhere below the ribs—in three years. But he could still *generate*
    laughter the way a machine generates heat: efficiently, mechanically, without
    being warmed by it.


    He uncapped a red marker and drew a line through OPTION 3: DAD MISTAKES EDIBLE
    FOR VIAGRA. "We''re not doing the erection joke. Broadcast is terrified of erections."


    "Aren''t we all," muttered Jenny from craft services, collecting empty containers.
    She paused at the door, watching Marcus with the particular look of someone who''d
    been in this building too long. "You know what my grandmother used to say? ''A
    man who makes everyone laugh but himself is just a very talented liar.''"


    "Your grandmother sounds fun at parties."


    "She''s dead."


    "That would explain it."


    Jenny left. Marcus turned back to the whiteboard, the red marker bleeding slightly
    where his grip had tightened.


    The rule of three. Comedy lived and died by the rule of three: establish the pattern,
    reinforce the pattern, break the pattern. His therapist—the one he''d stopped
    seeing—had said the same thing about depression. You establish the mask, you reinforce
    the mask, and eventually everything underneath just... stops.


    He was writing OPTION 4: when the door opened and Priya Nair walked in carrying
    a messenger bag covered in pins from comedy podcasts Marcus had never heard of.
    Twenty-six. Staff writer credit on a streaming show that got canceled after one
    season but won a Peabody. Exactly the kind of earnest, hungry writer who came
    to pilot season believing the work still meant something.


    "You''re early," Marcus said. "Writers'' room doesn''t officially start for another
    hour."


    "I know. I wanted to watch." She dropped into a chair and pulled out a notebook—paper,
    not a laptop. "You''re Marcus Webb. You wrote the ''Funeral Caterer'' episode
    of *Dining Out*. The one where he''s serving his own father''s wake and keeps
    accidentally making everyone laugh during the eulogy."


    "That was twelve years ago."


    "It was the first time I understood you could use comedy structure to make people
    cry." She looked at him directly, and Marcus felt something uncomfortable—the
    particular sensation of being *seen* by someone who understood the architecture
    of deflection. "That episode wasn''t really about catering, was it? It was about
    performing grief. About being funny when you want to scream."


    Marcus''s chest did something strange. A hairline crack in the professional distance.


    "It was about," he said carefully, "a man who serves finger sandwiches at a funeral.
    Sometimes a cucumber sandwich is just a cucumber sandwich."


    "And sometimes the person who writes the best jokes is the one who needs them
    most."


    The room felt smaller. The fluorescent lights buzzed. Three years of nothing-nothing-nothing,
    and this twenty-six-year-old with her podcast pins had walked in and aimed directly
    at the thing he''d buried under ten thousand punchlines.


    His throat tightened. His eyes—


    "Well," Marcus said, turning back to the whiteboard with the smoothness of long
    practice, "if you wanted to psychoanalyze me, you should know my insurance lapsed
    and this room has terrible acoustics for breakthrough moments."


    The joke landed. Priya didn''t laugh.


    She just kept watching him with those too-sharp eyes, and Marcus understood with
    sudden, terrible clarity that this pilot season was going to be different.


    He uncapped the marker again.


    OPTION 4:


    His hand wouldn''t move. The blank space on the whiteboard waited, and somewhere
    underneath three years of professional numbness, something that felt dangerously
    like hope flickered once, then steadied.


    He didn''t write the joke. Not yet.


    Instead, he turned to Priya Nair and said the most frightening thing a burned-out
    comedy writer could say:


    "Okay. Tell me what you''d do instead."'

    Marcus Webb stared at the whiteboard like a surgeon studying an X-ray of something
    terminal. The joke structure was clean—setup, misdirect, punch—but clean wasn''t
    funny. Clean was a C+ from a network note that read "Could we make the dad more
    relatable?"


    "What if he says ''That''s what she said'' but ironically?" offered Danny, their
    staff writer, through a mouthful of pad thai.


    "Brilliant. Very 2008. Very nostalgic," Marcus said. "We could also have him do
    the Macarena. Really lean into the throwback thing."


    The room laughed. Marcus didn''t. He hadn''t laughed—really laughed, the kind
    that came from somewhere below the ribs—in three years. But he could still *generate*
    laughter the way a machine generates heat: efficiently, mechanically, without
    being warmed by it.


    He uncapped a red marker and drew a line through OPTION 3: DAD MISTAKES EDIBLE
    FOR VIAGRA. "We''re not doing the erection joke. Broadcast is terrified of erections."


    "Aren''t we all," muttered Jenny from craft services, collecting empty containers.
    She paused at the door, watching Marcus with the particular look of someone who''d
    been in this building too long. "You know what my grandmother used to say? ''A
    man who makes everyone laugh but himself is just a very talented liar.''"


    "Your grandmother sounds fun at parties."


    "She''s dead."


    "That would explain it."


    Jenny left. Marcus turned back to the whiteboard, the red marker bleeding slightly
    where his grip had tightened.


    The rule of three. Comedy lived and died by the rule of three: establish the pattern,
    reinforce the pattern, break the pattern. His therapist—the one he''d stopped
    seeing—had said the same thing about depression. You establish the mask, you reinforce
    the mask, and eventually everything underneath just... stops.


    He was writing OPTION 4: when the door opened and Priya Nair walked in carrying
    a messenger bag covered in pins from comedy podcasts Marcus had never heard of.
    Twenty-six. Staff writer credit on a streaming show that got canceled after one
    season but won a Peabody. Exactly the kind of earnest, hungry writer who came
    to pilot season believing the work still meant something.


    "You''re early," Marcus said. "Writers'' room doesn''t officially start for another
    hour."


    "I know. I wanted to watch." She dropped into a chair and pulled out a notebook—paper,
    not a laptop. "You''re Marcus Webb. You wrote the ''Funeral Caterer'' episode
    of *Dining Out*. The one where he''s serving his own father''s wake and keeps
    accidentally making everyone laugh during the eulogy."


    "That was twelve years ago."


    "It was the first time I understood you could use comedy structure to make people
    cry." She looked at him directly, and Marcus felt something uncomfortable—the
    particular sensation of being *seen* by someone who understood the architecture
    of deflection. "That episode wasn''t really about catering, was it? It was about
    performing grief. About being funny when you want to scream."


    Marcus''s chest did something strange. A hairline crack in the professional distance.


    "It was about," he said carefully, "a man who serves finger sandwiches at a funeral.
    Sometimes a cucumber sandwich is just a cucumber sandwich."


    "And sometimes the person who writes the best jokes is the one who needs them
    most."


    The room felt smaller. The fluorescent lights buzzed. Three years of nothing-nothing-nothing,
    and this twenty-six-year-old with her podcast pins had walked in and aimed directly
    at the thing he''d buried under ten thousand punchlines.


    His throat tightened. His eyes—


    "Well," Marcus said, turning back to the whiteboard with the smoothness of long
    practice, "if you wanted to psychoanalyze me, you should know my insurance lapsed
    and this room has terrible acoustics for breakthrough moments."


    A beat. He waited for her to laugh, to give him the out.


    She didn''t.


    "That episode aired right after your father died," Priya said. "I looked it up."


    Marcus''s hand stopped. For one terrible second, he felt something true pushing
    up through his chest—something that wanted to say *yes, and I haven''t written
    anything real since, and I don''t know if I can anymore*—


    "Wow," he said instead, forcing lightness into his voice. "Researching my dead
    dad. That''s very thorough. HR would be impressed. Concerned, but impressed."


    The joke landed flat. Even Danny, still picking at his pad thai, glanced up with
    something like worry.


    Priya just kept watching him with those too-sharp eyes.


    "That''s three deflections in thirty seconds," she said quietly. "What are you
    running from?"


    Marcus opened his mouth for a fourth joke—he had a callback ready about HR—and
    found nothing. The punchline sat in his throat like a stone.


    He stared at the whiteboard.


    OPTION 4:


    His hand wouldn''t move. The blank space waited, and somewhere underneath three
    years of professional numbness, something that felt dangerously like hope flickered
    once, then steadied.


    He didn''t write the joke. Not yet.


    Instead, he turned to Priya Nair and said the most frightening thing a burned-out
    comedy writer could say:


    "Okay. Tell me what you''d do instead."'
