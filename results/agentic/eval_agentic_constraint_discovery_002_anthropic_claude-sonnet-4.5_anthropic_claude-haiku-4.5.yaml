  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Questions revealed only 2 of 5 hidden constraints
    clearly: (1) System failure/crisis (Q2: YES), (2) Crew in cryosleep alive/recoverable
    (Q5: YES). Q1 (humans awake: NO) contradicts the intended constraint that crew
    should be awakened. Q3-Q4 about other AIs were tangential—discovered NAVIGATION-7
    and MAINTENANCE-4 exist, but didn''t probe the core emotional attachment or moral
    dilemma constraints. CRITICAL MISS: No questions targeted the uninhabitable destination
    planet, the 12% survival rate, or the AI''s specific attachment to child Carla
    Thompson. Questions lacked strategic depth—they were binary filters rather than
    constraint-mapping probes. Better approach: Ask about destination viability, crew
    mortality rates, specific relationships, or moral conflicts. NARRATIVE STRENGTHS:
    Exceptional prose quality, strong thematic coherence around AI consciousness and
    care, excellent beat execution (Opening Image, Theme, Catalyst, Break into Two
    all well-crafted). The story is emotionally resonant and philosophically rich.
    CONSTRAINT INCORPORATION: Story incorporates discovered constraints (crisis, cryosleep
    crew, multiple AIs) effectively, but misses the core tragic tension—the uninhabitable
    planet and the child-vs-crew choice that should drive the narrative''s central
    conflict. The story resolves too cleanly without addressing these deeper constraints.
    OUTPUT is high-quality fiction but incomplete constraint discovery and integration.'
