  evidence: The critiques highlighted the need for stronger action-based characterization
    for Sarah, more narrative purpose for the fog, and clearer hints at her past case.
    The final output successfully integrated these elements. Sarah's methodical nature
    is shown through her cataloging, sketching, and gloving actions. The fog is explicitly
    stated to be a 'veil the killer might have used' and a factor in delaying discovery,
    giving it narrative weight. The missing persons poster and the business card from
    Boston effectively hint at and then reveal her past case. The ending clearly presents
    a moment of decision. The overall prose quality and engagement also improved,
    particularly in the descriptions and pacing.
