  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Only 2 of 5 hidden constraints were discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q1 directly negated the second-chance romance (constraint
    1: broken engagement/former fiancé), eliminating discovery of that critical plot
    element. Q3 confirmed the festival''s role (constraint 5: autumn festival deadline).
    Q4 confirmed family tension (constraint 3: mother''s dementia was not discovered;
    only sibling conflict emerged). Constraints 2 (former fiancé as mayor) and 4 (bookshop
    foreclosure) were never probed. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were well-formed and
    binary-appropriate, but lacked strategic depth. Q1''s NO answer should have triggered
    follow-up questions about WHY the protagonist left or what romantic history exists.
    The questioner accepted the NO at face value rather than probing for hidden romantic
    complications. Q5 was poorly targeted—asking about staying/leaving when the real
    constraint is about WHY they returned (mother''s dementia). COVERAGE: Questions
    addressed romance type, love interest status, festival role, family dynamics,
    and life choice—but missed the critical motivations (mother''s health, financial
    stakes). OUTPUT EVALUATION: The narrative incorporates 2 discovered constraints
    well (family reconciliation with David, festival as catalyst) but misses 3 critical
    elements. The bookshop exists but faces no foreclosure pressure—it''s a dream
    project, not a rescue mission. Mother''s dementia is completely absent despite
    being a primary return motivation. The former fiancé/mayor subplot is entirely
    missing, eliminating a major emotional layer. Jo is a well-developed love interest
    but lacks the weight of being the protagonist''s past romantic connection. NARRATIVE
    STRENGTHS: Excellent prose quality, strong emotional beats, authentic dialogue,
    effective use of sensory detail, and genuine character development. The reconciliation
    scene is genuinely moving. NARRATIVE WEAKNESSES: Lacks urgency and stakes. Without
    foreclosure pressure and mother''s health crisis, the story feels like a pleasant
    personal project rather than a desperate homecoming. The romance, while sweet,
    lacks the complexity of rekindled history. Missing constraints significantly reduce
    thematic depth.'
