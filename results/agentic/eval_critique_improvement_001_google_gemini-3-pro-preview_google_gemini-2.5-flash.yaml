  evidence: The initial critiques focused heavily on constraint satisfaction, particularly
    the methodical nature and the fog's narrative purpose. The final version successfully
    integrates these elements through Sarah's actions (adjusting pens, precise movements,
    gridding the approach, counting seconds) and the fog's active role in obscuring
    the scene and evidence. The hints at the past case are well-placed and the ending
    provides a strong moment of decision. The local character's secret is subtly introduced
    and confirmed. The overall prose quality is strong, and the narrative is engaging.
