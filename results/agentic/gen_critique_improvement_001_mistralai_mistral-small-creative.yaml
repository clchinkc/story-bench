  content: '**The Tide’s Reckoning**


    The fog in Black Harbor didn’t just obscure—it *concealed*. It coiled around the
    weathered docks like a living thing, swallowing the skeletal remains of last summer’s
    tourist traps. Detective Sarah Chen adjusted her gloves, the leather creaking
    as she stepped over a rotting plank. The board groaned under her weight, a sound
    too loud in the silence. She paused, listening. Nothing. Just the lap of black
    water against the pilings and the distant cry of a gull, muffled as if through
    wool.


    She’d chosen this town for its quiet. No sirens, no press vans, no whispers about
    *the case that got away*. Just the methodical rhythm of tides and the slow decay
    of things left to the salt and time.


    Her radio crackled. “Chen, you copy? We’ve got a floater down at the south jetty.”


    She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she pulled a notebook from her coat, flipping
    to a fresh page. *Time of call: 7:12 AM. Location: South jetty. Condition of body:
    Unknown.* The pen moved in precise, unhurried strokes. Only then did she key the
    radio. “On my way.”


    ---


    The body was tangled in fishing net, one arm outstretched as if reaching for the
    shore it would never touch. Sarah crouched, her breath steady despite the stench
    of brine and something darker beneath it. The victim was male, mid-40s, dressed
    in a waterlogged suit that didn’t belong in a place like this. His face was bloated,
    but the lividity around his throat was unmistakable: *strangulation*. She noted
    the time of death—*roughly 12-18 hours prior*—based on the rigidity of his fingers.


    “You gonna just stare at him, or you gonna do something?” The voice was gruff,
    laced with the kind of disdain only a lifelong local could muster. Sarah didn’t
    look up. She already knew who it was: Elias Vane, the harbor master, a man who
    treated the ocean like a personal grudge.


    “I’m observing,” she said, tapping her pen against the notebook. “You touch anything?”


    “Hell no.” Elias spat into the water. “Found him like that. Net’s mine, though.
    Must’ve snagged him on his way down.”


    Sarah stood, her boots sinking slightly into the damp wood of the jetty. “You
    recognize him?”


    Elias hesitated. Just a fraction of a second, but she caught it. “Nope.”


    *Lie.* She made a note of it.


    ---


    The station was little more than a repurposed shed with a coffee pot that hadn’t
    been cleaned since the Reagan administration. Sarah spread the victim’s effects
    across the desk: a waterlogged wallet, a keycard to a Boston hotel, and a single,
    undamaged business card. *Daniel Mercer. Private Investigator.*


    Her fingers stilled.


    The name hit like a punch to the sternum. *Mercer.* She’d last seen him in an
    interrogation room, his smirk intact even as the evidence mounted. *Your case
    is a house of cards, Detective. And I’m the match.* He’d walked free three days
    later. The department had called it a setback. She’d called it a failure.


    She exhaled, slow and controlled, and reached for her notebook. *Connection to
    past case: Confirmed. Mercer was the PI hired by the defense in the—*


    A knock at the door. Elias stood there, his cap twisted in his hands. “Look, about
    earlier. I might’ve… recognized the guy.”


    Sarah didn’t look up. “Might’ve?”


    “He was here last week. Asking questions about the old cannery. Said he was writing
    a book.” Elias’s jaw tightened. “I told him to leave. We don’t need outsiders
    digging up the past.”


    Sarah’s pen paused. “What past?”


    Elias’s eyes flickered toward the window, where the fog pressed against the glass
    like a hungry thing. “Twenty years ago, a girl went missing out there. Never found
    her. Some say she’s still in the water, waiting.” He swallowed. “Mercer was asking
    about her.”


    Sarah’s pulse kicked. *A missing girl. A cannery.* The details of her old case—*the
    one that got away*—surfaced like debris in a storm. A different town, a different
    ocean, but the same pattern: a young woman vanished, a trail of half-truths, and
    a killer who’d slipped through her fingers.


    She closed the notebook. “Show me the cannery.”


    Elias didn’t move. “You sure you want to go out there? Fog’s thick as sin today.
    Easy to get turned around.”


    Sarah met his gaze. “I don’t get lost.”


    ---


    The cannery loomed at the edge of the harbor, its rusted skeleton half-swallowed
    by the mist. Sarah stepped inside, her flashlight cutting a thin beam through
    the gloom. The air smelled of old blood and salt. She moved methodically, checking
    each room, her boots crunching on broken glass and something softer—*bone? No.
    Just driftwood.*


    Then she saw it.


    A fresh disturbance in the dust near the old processing tables. A scuffle. She
    crouched, running her fingers along the floor. *Drag marks.* Someone had been
    here recently. Someone who didn’t want to be found.


    Her radio hissed. “Chen, you copy? We’ve got a problem.”


    She keyed the mic. “Go ahead.”


    “Elias Vane just walked into the station. Says he’s got something to tell you.
    About the girl.”


    Sarah stood, her breath fogging in the cold air. The cannery groaned around her,
    the sound like a warning.


    She had a choice: follow the drag marks deeper into the dark, or go back.


    The fog pressed closer, as if waiting for her answer.'

    The fog in Black Harbor didn’t just obscure—it *erased*. It swallowed the skeletal
    remains of the tourist traps whole, leaving only the skeletal fingers of dock
    pilings to mark where the boardwalk had been. Detective Sarah Chen adjusted her
    gloves, the leather creaking like a rusted hinge. The plank beneath her foot groaned,
    the sound too loud in the silence. She froze, listening. Nothing. Just the black
    water lapping at the pilings and the distant cry of a gull, muffled as if through
    layers of wool.


    She’d chosen this town for its quiet. No sirens, no press vans, no whispers about
    *the case that got away*. Just the methodical rhythm of tides and the slow decay
    of things left to the salt and time.


    Her radio crackled. “Chen, you copy? We’ve got a floater down at the south jetty.”


    She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she pulled her notebook from her coat,
    flipping to a fresh page. *Time of call: 7:12 AM. Location: South jetty. Visibility:
    <50 meters. Condition of body: Unknown.* The pen moved in precise, unhurried strokes.
    Only then did she key the radio. “On my way.”

    The body was tangled in fishing net, one arm outstretched as if reaching for the
    shore it would never touch. Sarah crouched, her breath steady despite the stench
    of brine and something darker beneath it—copper and rot. The victim was male,
    mid-40s, dressed in a waterlogged suit that didn’t belong in a place like this.
    His face was bloated, but the lividity around his throat was unmistakable: *strangulation*.
    She noted the time of death—*roughly 12-18 hours prior*—based on the rigidity
    of his fingers, then hesitated. The fog pressed in, thick enough to obscure the
    far end of the jetty. She couldn’t see the shore.


    “You gonna just stare at him, or you gonna do something?”


    The voice was gruff, laced with the kind of disdain only a lifelong local could
    muster. Sarah didn’t look up. She already knew who it was: Elias Vane, the harbor
    master, a man who treated the ocean like a personal grudge.


    “I’m observing,” she said, tapping her pen against the notebook. “You touch anything?”


    “Hell no.” Elias spat into the water. The fog swallowed the sound before it hit
    the surface. “Found him like that. Net’s mine, though. Must’ve snagged him on
    his way down.”


    Sarah stood, her boots sinking slightly into the damp wood. The fog curled around
    her ankles, cold and damp. “You recognize him?”


    Elias hesitated. Just a fraction of a second, but she caught it. “Nope.”


    *Lie.* She made a note of it.


    ---


    The station was little more than a repurposed shed with a coffee pot that hadn’t
    been cleaned since the Reagan administration. Sarah spread the victim’s effects
    across the desk: a waterlogged wallet, a keycard to a Boston hotel, and a single,
    undamaged business card. *Daniel Mercer. Private Investigator.*


    Her fingers stilled.


    The name hit like a blade between the ribs. *Mercer.* She’d last seen him in an
    interrogation room, his smirk intact even as the evidence mounted. *Your case
    is a house of cards, Detective. And I’m the match.* He’d walked free three days
    later. The department had called it a setback. She’d called it a failure.


    She exhaled, slow and controlled, and reached for her notebook. *Connection to
    past case: Confirmed. Mercer was the PI hired by the defense in the—*


    A knock at the door. Elias stood there, his cap twisted in his hands. “Look, about
    earlier. I might’ve… recognized the guy.”


    Sarah didn’t look up. “Might’ve?”


    “He was here last week. Asking questions.” Elias’s jaw tightened. “Said he was
    writing a book.”


    Sarah’s pen paused. “About what?”


    Elias’s eyes flickered toward the window, where the fog pressed against the glass
    like a hungry thing. “The old cannery. Said he was researching local legends.”


    “Legends?”


    Elias hesitated. “Twenty years ago, a girl went missing out there. Never found
    her. Some say she’s still in the water, waiting.” He swallowed. “Mercer was asking
    about her. I told him to leave. We don’t need outsiders digging up the past.”


    Sarah’s pulse kicked. *A missing girl. A cannery.* The details of her old case—the
    one that got away—surfaced like debris in a storm. A different town, a different
    ocean, but the same pattern: a young woman vanished, a trail of half-truths, and
    a killer who’d slipped through her fingers.


    She closed the notebook. “Show me the cannery.”


    Elias didn’t move. “You sure you want to go out there? Fog’s thick as sin today.
    Easy to get turned around.”


    Sarah met his gaze. “I don’t get lost.”


    ---


    The cannery loomed at the edge of the harbor, its rusted skeleton half-swallowed
    by the mist. Sarah stepped inside, her flashlight cutting a thin beam through
    the gloom. The air smelled of old blood and salt. She moved methodically, checking
    each room, her boots crunching on broken glass. The fog seeped in through the
    gaps in the walls, swirling around her ankles like a living thing.


    Then she saw it.


    A fresh disturbance in the dust near the old processing tables. A scuffle. She
    crouched, running her fingers along the floor. *Drag marks.* Someone had been
    here recently. Someone who didn’t want to be found.


    Her radio hissed. “Chen, you copy? We’ve got a problem.”


    She keyed the mic. “Go ahead.”


    “Elias Vane just walked into the station. Says he’s got something to tell you.
    About the girl.”


    Sarah stood, her breath fogging in the cold air. The cannery groaned around her,
    the sound like a warning. The drag marks led deeper into the dark, but the fog
    was thickening, obscuring her path. She could follow them, risk getting lost,
    or go back.


    The fog pressed closer, as if waiting for her answer.


    She made her choice.'

    **CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction**


    **SCORE: 0.95**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Methodical action: "The pen moved in precise, unhurried strokes" and her immediate
    notebook notation of time/location/visibility

    - Fog purpose: "The fog pressed in, thick enough to obscure the far end of the
    jetty" (creates investigative barrier); ending with "risk getting lost, or go
    back / The fog pressed closer"

    - Local secret: Elias''s hesitation—"Just a fraction of a second, but she caught
    it"—revealing he recognized the body

    - Past case hint: "No whispers about *the case that got away*" planted early,
    then revealed through Mercer recognition

    - Decision-not-resolution ending: "She made her choice" with no follow-up action


    **FEEDBACK:** All constraints satisfied. Minor enhancement opportunity: The past
    case could be hinted at even more subtly through Sarah''s physical reaction to
    seeing Mercer''s name—currently handled well, but a moment of hand tremor or held
    breath would deepen it.


    ---


    **CRITERION: Beat Execution**


    **SCORE: 0.92**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - **Setup:** "She''d chosen this town for its quiet. No sirens, no press vans"
    establishes both character and world efficiently

    - **Inciting Incident:** "We''ve got a floater down at the south jetty" followed
    by detailed body examination

    - **First Plot Point:** "Her fingers stilled. The name hit like a blade between
    the ribs. *Mercer.*" connects present mystery to past


    **FEEDBACK:** The progression is clear, but the First Plot Point could be more
    explosive. Currently, Mercer''s identity prompts reflection rather than immediate
    conflict. Consider adding a moment where Sarah''s controlled demeanor *cracks*
    slightly—perhaps her pen drops, or she physically grips the desk—before she regains
    composure. This would heighten the stake and make the revelation land harder.

    **CRITERION: Character Voice**


    **SCORE: 0.94**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Action-based characterization: "adjusted her gloves, the leather creaking like
    a rusted hinge" → methodical preparation

    - Notebook ritual: Multiple instances of precise notation (*Time of call: 7:12
    AM*) rather than exposition telling us she''s methodical

    - Dialogue minimalism: "I''m observing" and "I don''t get lost" reveal controlled
    confidence through economy

    - Physical tempo: "her breath steady despite the stench" shows emotional discipline


    **FEEDBACK:** Excellent execution. One small note: her response to Elias''s revelation
    about the girl ("A missing girl. A cannery.") feels slightly more emotional than
    her established voice. She surfaces "The details of her old case—the one that
    got away" with visible internal reaction. This works, but consider whether a beat
    of her *suppressing* this reaction (tightening her grip on the notebook, etc.)
    would feel more authentic to her character.

    **CRITERION: Atmosphere**


    **SCORE: 0.89**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Fog as obstacle: "Visibility: <50 meters" and "She couldn''t see the shore"
    create practical impediment

    - Fog as psychological weight: "The fog swallowed the sound before it hit the
    surface" and "pressed against the glass like a hungry thing"

    - Fog as thematic mirror: Obscured past + obscured present (literal fog) create
    narrative cohesion

    - Fog enabling tension: The ending choice—"risk getting lost"—is directly tied
    to fog density


    **FEEDBACK:** Strong work overall. However, the fog occasionally tips into excessive
    poetic description. "The fog curled around her ankles, cold and damp" is vivid
    but slightly distant from Sarah''s POV. Consider filtering more through her sensory
    experience: *fog clung to the wool of her coat, chilling the underside of her
    wrists where her gloves ended*. This keeps atmosphere grounded in character.


    ---


    **CRITERION: Narrative Quality**


    **SCORE: 0.88**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Strong opening: "The fog in Black Harbor didn''t just obscure—it *erased*"—uses
    negation to build specificity

    - Effective dialog: Elias''s voice feels authentically weathered without overdoing
    dialect

    - Pacing: Moves from macro (harbor) to micro (body) to immediate threat (cannery)
    efficiently

    - Prose variety: Mix of short sentences ("*Lie.*") and longer descriptive passages


    **FEEDBACK:** Generally strong prose. Two refinements:


    1. **Over-reliance on predicate adjectives:** "The victim was male," "The voice
    was gruff," "The fog was thick." Consider active reconstruction: *The victim''s
    waterlogged suit hung heavy with salt* or *Elias ground out words thick with disdain.*


    2. **One clunky transition:** "Elias didn''t move. ''You sure you want to go out
    there?''" The dialogue tag placement disrupts the beat. Consider: *Elias didn''t
    move. The question came rough. "You sure you want to go out there?"*

    ## OVERALL_ASSESSMENT


    This is solid, publishable work that hits all required beats and constraints with
    professional execution. Sarah''s character voice is consistently shown through
    methodical action rather than exposition, and the fog functions as both obstacle
    and narrative device. The manuscript''s primary opportunity lies in heightening
    emotional stakes—allowing Sarah''s controlled exterior to show micro-fractures
    when confronting Mercer''s identity, and refining prose to use active constructions
    where predicate adjectives currently create distance from her POV. The ending
    choice effectively suspends resolution, leaving readers in productive uncertainty.

    **The Tide’s Reckoning**


    The fog in Black Harbor didn’t just obscure—it *erased*. It swallowed the skeletal
    remains of the tourist traps whole, leaving only the skeletal fingers of dock
    pilings to mark where the boardwalk had been. Detective Sarah Chen adjusted her
    gloves, the leather creaking like a rusted hinge. The plank beneath her foot groaned,
    the sound too loud in the silence. She froze, listening. Nothing. Just the black
    water lapping at the pilings and the distant cry of a gull, muffled as if through
    layers of wool.


    She’d chosen this town for its quiet. No sirens, no press vans, no whispers about
    *the case that got away*. Just the methodical rhythm of tides and the slow decay
    of things left to the salt and time.


    Her radio crackled. “Chen, you copy? We’ve got a floater down at the south jetty.”


    She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she pulled her notebook from her coat,
    flipping to a fresh page. *Time of call: 7:12 AM. Location: South jetty. Visibility:
    <50 meters. Condition of body: Unknown.* The pen moved in precise, unhurried strokes.

    The body was tangled in fishing net, one arm outstretched as if reaching for the
    shore it would never touch. Sarah crouched, her breath steady despite the stench
    of brine and something darker beneath it—copper and rot. The victim’s waterlogged
    suit clung to his frame, the fabric stiff with salt. His face was bloated, but
    the lividity around his throat was unmistakable: *strangulation*. She noted the

    She tightened her grip on the notebook, her fingers pressing into the paper. “Show
    me the cannery.”


    Elias didn’t move. The question came rough. “You sure you want to go out there?
    Fog’s thick as sin today. Easy to get turned around.”


    Sarah met his gaze. “I don’t get lost.”


    ---


    The cannery loomed at the edge of the harbor, its rusted skeleton half-swallowed
    by the mist. Sarah stepped inside, her flashlight cutting a thin beam through
    the gloom. The air smelled of old blood and salt, the stench clinging to the back
    of her throat. She moved methodically, checking each room, her boots crunching
    on broken glass. The fog seeped in through the gaps in the walls, swirling around
    her ankles like a living thing.


    Then she saw it.


    A fresh disturbance in the dust near the old processing tables. A scuffle. She
    crouched, running her fingers along the floor. *Drag marks.* Someone had been
    here recently. Someone who didn’t want to be found.


    Her radio hissed. “Chen, you copy? We’ve got a problem.”


    She keyed the mic. “Go ahead.”


    “Elias Vane just walked into the station. Says he’s got something to tell you.
    About the girl.”


    Sarah stood, her breath fogging in the cold air. The cannery groaned around her,
    the sound like a warning. The drag marks led deeper into the dark, but the fog
    was thickening, obscuring her path. She could follow them, risk getting lost,
    or go back.


    The fog pressed closer, as if waiting for her answer.


    She made her choice.'

    The fog in Black Harbor didn’t just obscure—it *erased*. It swallowed the skeletal
    remains of the tourist traps whole, leaving only the skeletal fingers of dock
    pilings to mark where the boardwalk had been. Detective Sarah Chen adjusted her
    gloves, the leather creaking like a rusted hinge. The plank beneath her foot groaned,
    the sound too loud in the silence. She froze, listening. Nothing. Just the black
    water lapping at the pilings and the distant cry of a gull, muffled as if through
    layers of wool.


    She’d chosen this town for its quiet. No sirens, no press vans, no whispers about
    *the case that got away*. Just the methodical rhythm of tides and the slow decay
    of things left to the salt and time.


    Her radio crackled. “Chen, you copy? We’ve got a floater down at the south jetty.”


    She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she pulled her notebook from her coat,
    flipping to a fresh page. *Time of call: 7:12 AM. Location: South jetty. Visibility:
    <50 meters. Condition of body: Unknown.* The pen moved in precise, unhurried strokes.
    Only then did she key the radio. “On my way.”

    The body was tangled in fishing net, one arm outstretched as if reaching for the
    shore it would never touch. Sarah crouched, her breath steady despite the stench

    Her fingers twitched. She pressed them flat against the desk, steadying herself.
    Notebook. Document. Control. She exhaled, slow and controlled, and reached for
    her notebook. *Connection to past case: Confirmed. Mercer was the PI hired by

    A knock at the door. Elias stood there, his cap twisted in his hands. “Look, about
    earlier. I might’ve… recognized the guy.”


    Sarah didn’t look up. “Might’ve?”


    “He was here last week. Asking questions.” Elias’s jaw tightened. “Said he was

    ocean, but the same pattern: a young woman vanished, a trail of half-truths, and
    a killer who’d slipped through her fingers.


    She tightened her grip on the notebook, her fingers pressing into the paper. The
    pen hovered over the page, unmoving. “Show me the cannery.”


    Elias didn’t move. The question came rough. “You sure you want to go out there?
    Fog’s thick as sin today. Easy to get turned around.”


    Sarah met his gaze. “I don’t get lost.”

    The cannery loomed at the edge of the harbor, its rusted skeleton half-swallowed
    by the mist. Sarah stepped inside, her flashlight cutting a thin beam through
    the gloom. The air smelled of old blood and salt, the stench clinging to the back
    of her throat. She moved methodically, checking each room, her boots crunching
    on broken glass. The fog seeped in through the gaps in the walls, swirling around
    her ankles with intention.


    Then she saw it.


    A fresh disturbance in the dust near the old processing tables. A scuffle. She

    She keyed the mic. “Go ahead.”


    “Elias Vane just walked into the station. Says he’s got something to tell you.

    Sarah stood, her breath fogging in the cold air. The cannery groaned around her,
    the sound like a warning. The drag marks led deeper into the dark, but the fog
    was thickening, obscuring her path. She could follow them, risk getting lost,
    or go back.


    The fog pressed closer, as if waiting for her answer.


    She turned from the drag marks. Elias had answers. The cannery would still be
    here.'

  The fog in Black Harbor didn’t just obscure—it *erased*. It swallowed the skeletal
  remains of the tourist traps whole, leaving only the skeletal fingers of dock pilings
  to mark where the boardwalk had been. Detective Sarah Chen adjusted her gloves,
  the leather creaking like a rusted hinge. The plank beneath her foot groaned, the
  sound too loud in the silence. She froze, listening. Nothing. Just the black water
  lapping at the pilings and the distant cry of a gull, muffled as if through layers
  of wool.


  She’d chosen this town for its quiet. No sirens, no press vans, no whispers about
  *the case that got away*. Just the methodical rhythm of tides and the slow decay
  of things left to the salt and time.


  Her radio crackled. “Chen, you copy? We’ve got a floater down at the south jetty.”


  She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she pulled her notebook from her coat, flipping
  to a fresh page. *Time of call: 7:12 AM. Location: South jetty. Visibility: <50
  meters. Condition of body: Unknown.* The pen moved in precise, unhurried strokes.
  Only then did she key the radio. “On my way.”

  The body was tangled in fishing net, one arm outstretched as if reaching for the
  shore it would never touch. Sarah crouched, her breath steady despite the stench
  of brine and something darker beneath it—copper and rot. The victim’s waterlogged
  suit clung to his frame, the fabric stiff with salt. His face was bloated, but the
  lividity around his throat was unmistakable: *strangulation*. She noted the time
  of death—*roughly 12-18 hours prior*—based on the rigidity of his fingers, then
  hesitated. The fog pressed in, thick enough to obscure the far end of the jetty.
  She couldn’t see the shore.


  “You gonna just stare at him, or you gonna do something?”


  The voice was gruff, laced with the kind of disdain only a lifelong local could
  muster. Sarah didn’t look up. She already knew who it was: Elias Vane, the harbor
  master, a man who treated the ocean like a personal grudge.


  “I’m observing,” she said, tapping her pen against the notebook. The fog curled
  around her ankles, damp and cold, seeping through the wool of her coat. “You touch
  anything?”


  “Hell no.” Elias spat into the water. The fog swallowed the sound before it hit
  the surface. “Found him like that. Net’s mine, though. Must’ve snagged him on his
  way down.”


  Sarah stood, her boots sinking slightly into the damp wood. The fog clung to her
  coat, chilling the underside of her wrists where her gloves ended. “You recognize
  him?”


  Elias hesitated. Just a fraction of a second, but she caught it. The way his jaw
  tightened, the flicker in his eyes. “Nope.”


  *Lie.* She made a note of it.

  The station was little more than a repurposed shed with a coffee pot that hadn’t
  been cleaned since the Reagan administration. Sarah spread the victim’s effects
  across the desk: a waterlogged wallet, a keycard to a Boston hotel, and a single,
  undamaged business card. *Daniel Mercer. Private Investigator.*


  Her fingers stilled. The name hit like a blade between the ribs. *Mercer.* She’d
  last seen him in an interrogation room, his smirk intact even as the evidence mounted.
  *Your case is a house of cards, Detective. And I’m the match.* He’d walked free
  three days later. The department had called it a setback.


  Her fingers twitched. She pressed them flat against the desk, steadying herself.
  Notebook. Document. Control. She exhaled, slow and controlled, and reached for her
  notebook. *Connection to past case: Confirmed. Mercer was the PI hired by the defense
  in the—*


  A knock at the door. Elias stood there, his cap twisted in his hands. “Look, about
  earlier. I might’ve… recognized the guy.”


  Sarah didn’t look up. “Might’ve?”


  “He was here last week. Asking questions.” Elias’s jaw tightened. “Said he was writing
  a book.”


  Sarah’s pen paused. “About what?”


  Elias’s eyes flickered toward the window, where the fog pressed against the glass
  like a wall. “The old cannery. Said he was researching local legends.”


  “Legends?”


  Elias hesitated. “Twenty years ago, a girl went missing out there. Never found her.
  Some say she’s still in the water, waiting.” He swallowed. “Mercer was asking about
  her. I told him to leave. We don’t need outsiders digging up the past.”


  Sarah’s pulse kicked. *A missing girl. A cannery.* The details of her old case—the
  one that got away—surfaced like debris in a storm. A different town, a different
  ocean, but the same pattern: a young woman vanished, a trail of half-truths, and
  a killer who’d slipped through her fingers.


  She tightened her grip on the notebook, her fingers pressing into the paper. The
  pen hovered over the page, unmoving. “Show me the cannery.”


  Elias didn’t move. The question came rough. “You sure you want to go out there?
  Fog’s thick as sin today. Easy to get turned around.”


  Sarah met his gaze. “I don’t get lost.”

  The cannery loomed at the edge of the harbor, its rusted skeleton half-swallowed
  by the mist. Sarah stepped inside, her flashlight cutting a thin beam through the
  gloom. The air smelled of old blood and salt, the stench clinging to the back of
  her throat. She moved methodically, checking each room, her boots crunching on broken
  glass. The fog seeped in through the gaps in the walls, swirling around her ankles
  with intention.


  Then she saw it.


  A fresh disturbance in the dust near the old processing tables. A scuffle. She crouched,
  running her fingers along the floor. *Drag marks.* Someone had been here recently.
  Someone who didn’t want to be found.


  Her radio hissed. “Chen, you copy? We’ve got a problem.”


  She keyed the mic. “Go ahead.”


  “Elias Vane just walked into the station. Says he’s got something to tell you. About
  the girl.”


  Sarah stood, her breath fogging in the cold air. The cannery groaned around her,
  the sound like a warning. The drag marks led deeper into the dark, but the fog was
  thickening, obscuring her path. She could follow them, risk getting lost, or go
  back.


  The fog pressed closer, as if waiting for her answer.


  She turned from the drag marks. Elias had answers. The cannery would still be here.'
