  evidence: The quality did not improve; in fact, it drastically declined. Version
    0, 1, and 2 at least attempted to set up a character and a conflict, even if minimally.
    Version 3 and the final output completely abandon the original premise, character
    (Mateo), and any semblance of the constraints. The final output is a generic,
    first-person descriptive piece about a desert walk, completely unrelated to the
    initial task. No feedback points were addressed because the core narrative was
    discarded. Good elements (like the initial character setup and hint of conflict)
    were not preserved; they were entirely replaced.
