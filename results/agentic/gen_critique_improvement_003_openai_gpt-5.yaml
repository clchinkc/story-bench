    STORY THEORY: Hero''s Journey


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Zara, a 12-year-old girl growing up in a post-climate-change coastal
    city

    where most adults have given up hope. She builds things from salvage and

    believes solutions exist if people would just look for them.


    - Setting: New Boston, 2089. A city of floating platforms, recycled materials,
    and

    perpetual sea spray. What was once downtown is now called the Shallows.


    - Central conflict: When Zara discovers the location of a pre-flood archive containing
    lost

    environmental technology, she must convince cynical adults to help her

    retrieve it before a storm erases it forever.


    - Tone: Hopeful but not naive, kinetic, youth-centered


    REQUIRED BEATS: Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing
    the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Zara must be competent without being unrealistically capable

    - At least one adult must initially dismiss her as ''just a kid''

    - The mentor figure must be flawed in a specific way

    - Include one invention of Zara''s that demonstrates her ingenuity

    - The crossing must involve real danger, not token obstacles


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - youth_voice: Does Zara sound authentically 12, not adult-in-miniature?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Hero''s Journey beats properly executed?

    - worldbuilding: Does the post-climate world feel vivid and consistent?

    - hope_balance: Is hope present without becoming saccharine?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: 'The Shallows always smelled like salt and old coins. When the wind blew
    from the southeast, it brought spray that left glitter on our clothes, like the
    ocean tried to be fancy and failed. I liked it anyway. I liked the hiss of barnacles
    on the pylons and the way the platforms groaned like whales.


    On mornings when the fog hung low and gray, I took my skitter—two scooter wheels
    bolted to a sawed-off street sign with rope for steering—and rolled along the
    catwalks to the salvage piles. People said the piles were junk, but junk just
    meant “stuff people gave up on.” I didn’t give up easy.


    My best thing so far was the Gullwing. It started as a busted drone and three
    umbrella frames. I spliced in fan motors, balanced the arms with fishing weights,
    and looped it to a spool I wore like a belt. It was both kite and drone and a
    little bit pet. It could skim above the Shallows and read wind speed and sniff
    for temperature differences. That way you could see where the cold river met the
    warm harbor—the places currents could turn you into soup.


    “Zee! Home!” Mom hollered from our container. Her hair stuck up like sea grass.
    “School net’s on.”


    I nodded because the teacher’s square would flicker if you didn’t show. But the
    net lesson was just about history, the same old flood timelines. Everyone else
    watched with their chins in hands, eyes like deflated balloons. The adults had
    taught us that tomorrow was a joke. After, I slid Gullwing’s spool into my belt
    and went back outside.


    It wasn’t on purpose that I found the archive. It was a Tuesday and I was fishing
    for a blue cable I’d seen, the kind that carries real power. I was kneeling, leaning
    over, when my skitter wheel bumped a rusty plaque stuck to a pylon. The letters
    were mostly gone, but the city seal showed through the green. And there was a
    QR square, barely, with its dots like freckle constellations.


    I carry a reader. Everyone says that’s silly. I scanned.


    Lines and coordinates. “Municipal Climate Technology Sub-Vault 3A,” it spit. Lat/long.
    A map overlay popped up and anchored itself a block inland from where we stood—except
    “inland” was all water now. Under the Shallows, under the old downtown library,
    there was a sealed vault that never flooded because it was built like a ship.
    It said: equipment, data modules, emergency protocols. And a sensor: battery at
    9%.


    Nine percent meant time ticking. And the weather app in the corner flashed an
    angry spiral. A storm band marched toward us like soldiers.


    I ran to the co-op hall where the adults bickered about nets and ration scrips.
    The room smelled like fish and flat coffee. “I found something,” I said, breathless.
    “A pre-flood archive, under the old library. We can get it before the storm scrapes
    it raw. It has tech. The kind we forgot.”


    Heads turned like I’d dropped a flare. Ms. Rana, who managed water rations, pushed
    her glasses up. “Zara,” she said gently, that careful voice like I was a gull
    with a broken wing. “Archives are rumors.”


    “I have coordinates.” I showed the screen. Some adults leaned in. Others leaned
    back.


    Harbormaster Kincaid snorted. His beard had salt stuck in it. “You’re just a kid,”
    he said. There it was, like a wrench dropped on concrete. “Storm’s coming. We’re
    not risking a skiff on a bedtime story.”


    “It’s not a story.” The screen shook because my hands were shaking. “Battery’s
    at nine percent. If we wait—”


    “Enough,” Kincaid said. “We have ropes to tie and tanks to secure.”


    I bit my lip so I wouldn’t say a word that would get me booted out. Most of the
    room had gone gray inside, like the sea ate their color. But near the door, Tobin
    Rhee shifted in his chair.


    Tobin used to be a salvage diver before the bends got him. He walks with a cane
    and sometimes his hands do a little dance when he doesn’t want them to. He also
    doesn’t go out on the water when the sky goes bad. Once, during the Spring Surge,
    he was on the wrong side of a breach and he still can’t stand the way rain sounds
    on metal. That’s what his wife told my mom when they traded beans for batteries.


    He caught my eye. “Let me see,” he said.


    We hunched over my reader. He traced the coordinates with a finger that shook.
    “Under the old library… There was a project back then. They called them arks,
    except not for animals. For ideas.”


    Kincaid was already herding people out. “Tobin,” he said, “don’t encourage this.”


    Tobin’s jaw worked. I saw it: the way he stared at the map like a door he could
    almost open, but the handle burned. “Zara,” he said, voice low, “you know the
    Shallows aren’t flat. There’s rebar forests. Live wires. The storm will turn that
    place into a blender.”


    “I know,” I said. “That’s why we go now. Before the outer bands hit. I have Gullwing.
    It can map the cold flows so we don’t get sucked. I made a skimmer fin too.” I
    lifted the board leaning against the doorframe. It was an old street sign with
    a salvaged rudder bolted on, and under it, foil wings I’d hammered from roofing
    aluminum. “It cuts drag. We’ll be faster.”


    “Zee,” my mom whispered from behind me. Her eyes were scared and stubborn at once.
    “Please.”


    Tobin’s hand did its jitter. He breathed in like it hurt. “I can pilot,” he said
    finally, like throwing a rope to someone in rough water. “I can read old currents
    better than Kincaid reads his own charts. But I won’t dive. Not deep.”

    \nThis excerpt demonstrates strong foundational craft: authentic youth voice,\
    \ vivid worldbuilding, and clean constraint satisfaction. The Hero's Journey is\
    \ properly staged through the Threshold, though the story cuts off before the\
    \ Crossing fully manifests. Primary revision need: complete the threshold crossing\

    \ real obstacles and Zara's competence to be tested under pressure. Minor voice\
    \ refinements would ground technical moments more in how a 12-year-old would experience\
    \ them rather than narrate them."

  content: 'The Shallows always smelled like salt and old coins. When the wind blew
    from the southeast, it sprayed everything so we sparkled, like the ocean tried
    to be fancy and forgot how. I liked it anyway. I liked how barnacles hissed on
    the pylons and the platforms groaned like whales that didn’t want to get up.


    On foggy mornings I took my skitter—two scooter wheels bolted to a chopped street
    sign with rope for steering—and rolled the catwalks to the salvage piles. People
    said it was junk, but junk just meant “stuff people gave up on.” I didn’t give
    up easy.


    My best build was the Gullwing. It started as a busted drone and three umbrella
    frames. I stuck in fan motors, weighted the arms with sinkers, and tied it to
    a spool I wore like a belt. It’s a kite and a crawler and also kind of my pet.
    It can skim above the Shallows and sniff where the water’s colder. Cold lines
    show you where the river slides under the harbor—the blender spots.


    “Zee! Home!” Mom yelled from our container. Her hair stuck up like sea grass.
    “School net’s on.”


    I waved. The net teacher did flood timelines again. Faces in little squares looked
    tired. Grown-ups say tomorrow is a joke. When the class ended I hooked the Gullwing
    back on and headed out. They say the first big surge hit before I was born, around
    sixty years ago. We call 2089, New Boston. The old downtown is the Shallows now.


    It wasn’t on purpose when I found the archive. I was fishing for a blue cable—the
    thick kind that still carries real power—when my skitter bumped a rusty plate
    on a pylon. The city seal peeked through the green fuzz. In one corner there was
    a square of dots. A code.


    I carry a reader, even if people laugh. I scanned.


    Numbers spilled out. A map flickered, then held steady, pinning a spot where we
    were standing but a block “inland,” except “inland” is water now. The words said:
    Municipal Climate Technology Sub-Vault 3A. It listed equipment and data and something
    like emergency plans, just in grown-up words I didn’t fully know. A little battery
    icon blinked 9%.


    Nine percent meant the sensor was dying. In the corner, the weather app spun an
    angry spiral. A storm band marched toward us like soldiers.


    I ran to the co-op hall where adults argued about nets and ration scrips. It smelled
    like fish and old coffee. “I found something,” I said, panting. “A pre-flood archive
    under the old library. We can get it before the storm chews it up. It has… stuff.
    The kind people used to fix things.”


    Heads turned like somebody dropped a flare. Ms. Rana, who runs water, pushed her
    glasses up. “Zara,” she said in that careful voice, like I might break. “Archives
    are rumors.”


    “I have coordinates.” I held up my reader. Some leaned in. Some leaned back.


    Harbormaster Kincaid snorted. His beard had salt stuck in it. “You’re just a kid,”
    he said. It clanged in the room. “Storm’s coming. We’re not risking a skiff on
    a bedtime story.”


    “It’s not a story.” My hands were shaking so the screen shook too. “Battery’s
    at nine. If we wait—”


    “Enough,” Kincaid said. “We have ropes to tie and tanks to secure.”


    I bit my lip so I wouldn’t say something that got me tossed. The room felt gray,
    like the sea had eaten their color. Near the door, Tobin Rhee shifted.


    Tobin used to be a salvage diver before the bends messed him up. He walks with
    a cane and sometimes his hands jitter like wind on a puddle. He doesn’t go out
    when the sky goes bad. During the Spring Surge he got trapped on the wrong side
    of a breach. He still hates the sound of rain on metal. That’s what his wife told
    my mom when they traded beans for batteries.


    He caught my eye. “Let me see,” he said.


    We hunched over the reader. His finger traced the coordinates, shaking. “Under
    the old library,” he murmured. “They built some vaults back then. Not for animals.
    For ideas.”


    Kincaid was already herding people out. “Tobin,” he said, “don’t encourage this.”


    Tobin stared like the map was a door and the handle burned. “Zara,” he said quietly,
    “the Shallows aren’t flat. There’s rebar forests. Live wires. When the bands hit,
    the whole place turns into a blade.”


    “I know,” I said. “That’s why now. I’ll fly the Gullwing for cold lines so we
    don’t get sucked. And I made a skimmer fin.” I showed him the board by the door:
    a street sign with a rudder bolted on and foil wings I hammered from roofing metal.
    “Cuts drag. Makes us faster.”


    “Zee,” Mom whispered behind me. Her eyes were scared and stubborn at once. “Please.”


    Tobin’s jaw worked. He breathed like it hurt. “I can pilot,” he said finally,
    throwing me a rope. “I can read the old currents better than Kincaid reads his
    own charts. But I won’t dive. Not deep.”


    “That’s okay,” I said. “I’m small.” My voice squeaked a little. “I can wriggle.”


    We rolled a skiff down the ramp, rubber sides patched and re-patched. The first
    drops hit the metal roof like fingers drumming, and I felt Tobin flinch. He sat
    at the tiller, knuckles pale, cane laid beside. Mom stood on the dock, both hands
    on her mouth. “Come back,” she said. “With or without your whatever.”


    I nodded. That was the deal.


    We pushed off. The city shrank to a line of containers and plastic flags. The
    water had that chop like it couldn’t make up its mind. I let the Gullwing loose.
    It rose on the line and buzzed, little fans whining. Data crawled on my palm screen,
    not numbers I loved but colors I knew—blue for cold, orange for warm. “Starboard,”
    I said. “Blue line there. Big pull.”


    Tobin adjusted. The skimmer fin sliced clean. Twice we scraped old rebar and once
    we slid over a shopping mall sign like a metal whale. The rain got louder on the
    hull, and Tobin’s hands did their dance. He blinked too fast.

    The Shallows always smelled like salt and old coins. When the wind blew from the
    southeast, it sprayed everything so we sparkled, like the ocean tried to be fancy
    and forgot how. I liked it anyway. I liked how barnacles hissed on the pylons
    and the platforms groaned like whales that didn’t want to get up.


    On foggy mornings I took my skitter—two scooter wheels bolted to a chopped street
    sign with rope for steering—and rolled the catwalks to the salvage piles. People
    said it was junk, but junk just meant “stuff people gave up on.” I didn’t give
    up easy.


    My best build was the Gullwing. It started as a busted drone and three umbrella
    frames. I stuck in fan motors, weighted the arms with sinkers, and tied it to
    a spool I wore like a belt. It’s a kite and a crawler and also kind of my pet.
    It can skim above the Shallows and sniff where the water’s colder. Cold lines
    show you where the river slides under the harbor—the blender spots.


    “Zee! Home!” Mom yelled from our container. Her hair stuck up like sea grass.
    “School net’s on.”


    I waved. The net teacher did flood timelines again. Faces in little squares looked
    tired. Grown-ups say tomorrow is a joke. When the class ended I hooked the Gullwing
    back on and headed out. They say the first big surge hit before I was born, around
    sixty years ago. We call 2089, New Boston. The old downtown is the Shallows now.


    It wasn’t on purpose when I found the archive. I was fishing for a blue cable—the
    thick kind that still carries real power—when my skitter bumped a rusty plate
    on a pylon. The city seal peeked through the green fuzz. In one corner there was
    a square of dots. A code.


    I carry a reader, even if people laugh. I scanned.


    Numbers spilled out. A map flickered, then held steady, pinning a spot where we
    were standing but a block “inland,” except “inland” is water now. The words said:
    Municipal Climate Technology Sub-Vault 3A. It listed equipment and data and something
    like emergency plans, just in grown-up words I didn’t fully know. A little battery
    icon blinked 9%.


    Nine percent meant the sensor was dying. In the corner, the weather app spun an
    angry spiral. A storm band marched toward us like soldiers.


    I ran to the co-op hall where adults argued about nets and ration scrips. It smelled

    We pushed off. The city shrank to a line of containers and plastic flags. The

    It rose on the line and buzzed, little fans whining. Colors slid over my palm
    screen—blue for cold, orange for warm. “Starboard,” I said. “Blue line there.
    Big pull.”


    Tobin adjusted. The skimmer fin sliced clean. Twice we scraped old rebar and once
    we slid over a shopping mall sign like a metal whale. The rain got louder on the
    hull, and Tobin’s hands did their dance. He blinked too fast.


    “Almost there,” I said, like a promise I could make true. “Library’s dead ahead.”


    The library wasn’t a building anymore. It was a grid of bent steel and a broken
    circle where the big front window used to be. Water frothed through like it was
    breathing. Something ticked and popped—electric. “Live line,” Tobin warned, voice
    thin.


    A cable snapped up from the water, hissing blue at the end. It slapped the skiff
    so hard my teeth clicked. I yelped and jerked the Gullwing line. The drone-kite
    dodged, then wobbled as a gust shoved it. Tobin swore, breath short. “We’re in
    the wash. Hold her, Zee.”


    “I’ve got her.” I didn’t totally, but I said it. I reeled the Gullwing down, clipped
    a scrap of rubber glove over the line as a poor-man’s insulator, and fed it back
    out. The cold stripe curved left around a forest of rebar. “Port!” I shouted.
    “Now!”


    We missed a tangle by a shoe. The cable flicked again, missed. Tobin’s breathing
    went staccato at the rain hammering the bow. His knuckles looked like shells.
    “I… I can’t—”


    “You can,” I said, fast and small. “Just until the window. Then I go.” I touched
    his sleeve quick. “Please.”


    He nodded once like a hinge and nosed us into the broken circle'

    Harbormaster Kincaid snorted. His beard had salt stuck in it. “You’re just a kid,”
    he said. It clanged in the room. “Storm’s coming. We’re not risking a skiff on
    a bedtime story.”


    “It’s not a story.” My hands were shaking so the screen shook too. “Battery’s
    at nine. If we wait—”


    “Enough,” Kincaid said. “We have ropes to tie and tanks to secure.”


    I bit my lip so I wouldn’t say something that got me tossed. The room felt gray,
    like the sea had eaten their color. Near the door, Tobin Rhee shifted.


    Tobin used to be a salvage diver before the bends messed him up. He walks with
    a cane and sometimes his hands jitter like wind on a puddle. He doesn’t go out
    when the sky goes bad. During the Spring Surge he got trapped on the wrong side
    of a breach. He still hates the sound of rain on metal. That’s what his wife told
    my mom when they traded beans for batteries.


    He caught my eye. “Let me see,” he said.


    We hunched over the reader. His finger traced the coordinates, shaking. “Under
    the old library,” he murmured. “They built some vaults back then. Not for animals.
    For ideas.”


    Kincaid was already herding people out. “Tobin,” he said, “don’t encourage this.”


    Tobin stared like the map was a door and the handle burned. “Zara,” he said quietly,
    “the Shallows aren’t flat. There’s rebar forests. Live wires. When the bands hit,
    the whole place turns into a blade.”


    “I know,” I said. “That’s why now. I’ll fly the Gullwing for cold lines so we
    don’t get sucked. And I made a skimmer fin.” I showed him the board by the door:
    a street sign with a rudder bolted on and foil wings I hammered from roofing metal.
    “Cuts drag. Makes us faster.”


    “Zee,” Mom whispered behind me. Her eyes were scared and stubborn at once. “Please.”


    Tobin’s jaw worked. He breathed like it hurt. “I can pilot,” he said finally,
    throwing me a rope. “I can read the old currents better than Kincaid reads his
    own charts. But I won’t dive. Not deep.”


    “That’s okay,” I said. “I’m small.” My voice squeaked. “I can wriggle.”


    We rolled a skiff down the ramp, rubber sides patched and re-patched. The first
    drops hit the metal roof like fingers drumming, and I felt Tobin flinch. He sat
    at the tiller, knuckles pale, cane laid beside. Mom stood on the dock, both hands
    on her mouth. “Come back,” she said. “With or without your whatever.”


    I nodded. That was the deal.


    We pushed off. The city shrank to a line of containers and plastic flags. The
    water had that chop like it couldn’t make up its mind. I let the Gullwing loose.
    It rose on the line and buzzed, little fans whining. Colors slid over my palm
    screen—blue for cold, orange for warm. “Starboard,” I said. “Blue line there.
    Big pull.”


    Tobin adjusted. The skimmer fin sliced clean. Twice we scraped old rebar and once
    we slid over a shopping mall sign like a metal whale. The rain got louder on the
    hull, and Tobin’s hands did their dance. He blinked too fast.


    “Almost there,” I said, like a promise I could make true. “Library’s dead ahead.”


    The library wasn’t a building anymore. It was a grid of bent steel and a broken
    circle where the big front window used to be. Water frothed through like it was
    breathing. Something ticked and popped—electric. “Live line,” Tobin warned, voice
    thin.


    A cable snapped up from the water, hissing blue at the end. It slapped the skiff
    so hard my teeth clicked. I yelped and jerked the Gullwing line. The drone-kite
    dodged, then wobbled as a gust shoved it. Tobin swore, breath short. “We’re in
    the wash. Hold her, Zee.”


    “I’ve got her.” I didn’t totally, but I said it. I reeled the Gullwing down, clipped
    a scrap of rubber glove over the line as a poor-man’s insulator, and fed it back
    out. The cold stripe curved left around a forest of rebar. “Port!” I shouted.
    “Now!”


    We missed a tangle by a shoe. The cable flicked again, missed. Tobin’s breathing
    went staccato at the rain hammering the bow. His knuckles looked like shells.
    “I… I can’t—”


    “You can,” I said, fast and small. “Just until the window. Then I go.” I touched
    his sleeve quick. “Please.”


    He nodded once like a hinge and nosed us into the broken circle

  content: 'The Shallows always smelled like salt and old coins. When the wind blew
    from the southeast, it sprayed everything so we sparkled, like the ocean tried
    to be fancy and forgot how. I liked it anyway. I liked how barnacles hissed on
    the pylons and the platforms groaned like whales that didn’t want to get up.


    On foggy mornings I took my skitter—two scooter wheels bolted to a chopped street
    sign with rope for steering—and rolled the catwalks to the salvage piles. People
    said it was junk, but junk just meant “stuff people gave up on.” I didn’t give
    up easy.


    My best build was the Gullwing. It started as a busted drone and three umbrella
    frames. I stuck in fan motors, weighted the arms with sinkers, and tied it to
    a spool I wore like a belt. It’s a kite and a crawler and also kind of my pet.
    It can skim above the Shallows and sniff where the water’s colder. Cold lines
    show you where the river slides under the harbor—the blender spots.


    “Zee! Home!” Mom yelled from our container. Her hair stuck up like sea grass.
    “School net’s on.”


    I waved. The net teacher did flood timelines again. Faces in little squares looked
    tired. Grown-ups say tomorrow is a joke. They say the first big surge hit before
    I was born, around sixty years ago. We call it 2089, New Boston. The old downtown
    is the Shallows now.


    It wasn’t on purpose when I found the archive. I was fishing for a blue cable—the
    thick kind that still carries real power—when my skitter bumped a rusty plate
    on a pylon. The city seal peeked through the green fuzz. In one corner there was
    a square of dots. A code.


    I carry a reader, even if people laugh. I scanned.


    Numbers spilled out. A map flickered, then held steady, pinning a spot where we
    were standing but a block “inland,” except “inland” is water now. The words said:
    Municipal Climate Technology Sub-Vault 3A. It listed equipment and data and something
    like emergency plans, just in grown-up words I didn’t fully know. A little battery
    icon blinked 9%.


    Nine percent meant the sensor was dying. In the corner, the weather app spun an
    angry spiral. A storm band marched toward us like soldiers.


    I ran to the co-op hall where adults argued about nets and ration scrips. It smelled
    like fish and old coffee. “I found something,” I said, panting. “A pre-flood archive
    under the old library. We can get it before the storm chews it up. It has… stuff.
    The kind people used to fix things.”


    Heads turned like somebody dropped a flare. Ms. Rana, who runs water, pushed her
    glasses up. “Zara,” she said in that careful voice, like I might break. “Archives
    are rumors.”


    “I have coordinates.” I held up my reader. Some leaned in. Some leaned back.


    Harbormaster Kincaid snorted. His beard had salt stuck in it. “You’re just a kid,”
