  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→1 refined sensory layering (cold coffee, metallic
    tang). Versions 1→2 deepened audio specificity (Mr. Chen''s uneven gait rhythm,
    squeaking cart wheels). Versions 2→3 crystallized the crucial audio clue (car
    door creak/thump in voicemail) and integrated it into plot mechanics. Final version
    demonstrates sophisticated progression from atmospheric setup to plot-critical
    audio evidence. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Non-visual sensory details PROMINENT—coffee
    temperature/aroma, radiator hissing, squeaking wheels, coin clinks, basketball
    thuds, car door creaks, gunfire pings. Sensory language dominates every scene.
    (2) Imani''s blindness RESPECTFUL & STRENGTH—explicitly framed as superior listening
    ability (''answers aren''t in what was said. They''re in what was heard''), screen
    reader integration, active agency in investigation, no pity or limitation framing.
    (3) SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE CRUCIAL—the car door creak/thump in voicemail becomes
    the lynchpin that overturns police timeline and drives entire plot. (4) CHARACTER
    UNDERESTIMATION—Detective Reyes dismisses her (''like he was humoring a kid''),
    questions her credibility (''how this sounds''), then becomes believer/ally. (5)
    FUN & GAMES ENTERTAINING BEFORE DARK—diner scene with banter, coffee swap, Reyes''s
    dry humor, Imani''s confidence creates rapport. Then pivots sharply to stalking,
    gunfire, life-threatening danger. BEAT EXECUTION: Catalyst (2:47 AM discovery)
    clearly marked. Fun & Games (diner scene) genuinely entertaining with character
    chemistry before threat escalation. Bad Guys Closed In (stalking/gunfire) delivers
    genuine danger. Inciting incident (phone call threat) establishes stakes. PRESERVATION:
    All versions maintained Brooklyn sensory specificity, Imani''s podcast framing,
    audio-centric worldbuilding. Final version synthesized best elements: Version
    0''s atmospheric opening, Version 1''s layered scent work, Version 2''s specific
    rhythmic details (Mr. Chen''s limp-drag), Version 3''s plot integration. MINOR
    GAPS: ''Midpoint'' beat not explicitly marked (though diner scene functions as
    such). Reyes''s initial skepticism could have been slightly more pronounced to
    heighten underestimation arc. Final action sequence slightly compressed—could
    expand gunfire choreography for tension. Overall: Strong execution with sophisticated
    sensory integration and respectful disability representation.'
