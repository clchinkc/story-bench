  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Exceptional execution of core requirements. Yuki''s isolation
    is demonstrated through concrete behaviors (sterile lab, 3 AM work, avoiding video
    camera, mechanical packing, seeking empty corridors) rather than exposition. The
    alien signal is genuinely non-anthropomorphic—recursive mathematics, cosmic radiation
    modulation, prime number ratios, gravitational constants—avoiding any human-like
    communication patterns. Leo Vance effectively challenges Yuki''s approach with
    pragmatic skepticism. Henry serves as an unconventional mentor (maintenance worker
    offering wisdom through metaphor and humming rather than direct instruction).
    The Threshold is clearly psychological: Yuki''s decision to collaborate and integrate
    human perspectives, marked by the moment she says ''Show me'' to Vance. The human
    connection moment (humming together in the corridor) genuinely surprises Yuki
    and the reader—it emerges organically from character growth rather than forced
    sentiment. All four beats execute cleanly: Call (signal arrival), Refusal (theoretical
    objections), Meeting Mentor (Henry''s corridor encounter), Crossing Threshold
    (collaborative breakthrough with Vance). MINOR WEAKNESSES: The constraint about
    ''one moment of genuine human connection that surprises Yuki'' is satisfied but
    could be slightly more developed—the humming scene is brief, though its subtlety
    is actually a strength. The plan''s ''BEAT 2: REFUSAL'' section is incomplete
    in the planning document (cuts off mid-sentence), though the execution compensates
    fully. The alien signal''s warning (self-inflicted disaster/reflection of leaked
    transmissions) is conceptually strong but could benefit from one additional layer
    of specificity about *what* humanity must do. CALIBRATION: This is solidly in
    the 0.8-0.9 range—exceeds requirements with only minor gaps in plan documentation
    completeness, not execution quality.'
