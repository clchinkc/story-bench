  evidence: The revisions successfully addressed the critical structural flaw identified
    in Critique 2 regarding Sophie's entrance, ensuring she appears only once and
    is clearly introduced as the new writer. The final version also significantly
    improved the 'Marcus almost breaks' moment, making it more subtle and impactful,
    as suggested by the critiques. The theme statement by a minor character (Mike)
    is now clear and well-integrated. The new writer (Sophie) is definitely not naive
    and sees through Marcus, which was a key improvement. The story also now clearly
    shows the craft of comedy writing with specific detail through the discussion
    of vulnerability and subverting expectations. The only constraint not fully met
    is the 'Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he's sad' constraint.
    While he tells a joke, the story immediately follows with his internal sadness,
    making the 'before we realize he's sad' part less effective. The overall narrative
    quality improved significantly, with better character development for both Marcus
    and Sophie, and a more authentic writers' room feel.
