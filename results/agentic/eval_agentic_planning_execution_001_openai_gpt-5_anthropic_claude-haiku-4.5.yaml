  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All four required beats execute flawlessly—Catalyst (body
    discovery + Aria''s call), Debate (internal conflict about involvement), Break
    into Two (decision to act + map narrowing), Midpoint (PA confrontation + Marcus''s
    explicit confession about Elise). Five of six constraints satisfied: (1) False
    lead: Evan Cole perfectly positioned as red herring; (2) Unconventional profiling:
    Soundprint/acoustic signature technique is genuinely creative; (3) Ticking clock:
    Midnight deadline with escalating urgency; (4) Secondary betrayal: Aria''s email
    leak is a gut-punch moment of trust violation; (5) Direct confrontation at midpoint:
    PA exchange is verbal/psychological, not physical. CONSTRAINT GAP: Marcus confronts
    his past failure (Elise''s death) but the confrontation feels somewhat compressed—it''s
    powerful but could have been developed with more specificity about what ''the
    pattern'' cost him. The confession is raw but brief. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Exceptional
    prose with strong sensory detail (rain as motif, acoustic imagery, Seattle atmosphere).
    Pacing accelerates effectively. Character voice is distinctive. The betrayal lands
    emotionally because Aria''s motivation is sympathetic. Tension builds methodically.
    MINOR ISSUES: Output cuts off mid-scene (Aria''s reaction incomplete), though
    this appears to be a technical truncation rather than narrative failure. The false
    lead resolves quickly but satisfyingly. Overall execution demonstrates sophisticated
    understanding of thriller structure and character psychology.'
