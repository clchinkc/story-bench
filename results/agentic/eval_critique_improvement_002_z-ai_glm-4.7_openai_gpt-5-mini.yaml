  evidence: 'Across versions the piece clearly responded to the emotional-complexity
    critiques: V0 presented a jokey setup with limited interiority; V1 tightened the
    comic beats (space-heater bits); V2 added sensory detail and the marker/room atmosphere;
    V3 introduced Maya, an explicit theme statement by a minor character (Jerry),
    and the near-break moment where Marcus covers pain with a joke. Strengths (the
    comic beats and specific craft details) are preserved while pathos and character
    stakes increase. The Save the Cat elements are hinted at (Theme Stated, B-story,
    Act Two heading) but a full beat-map is not fully demonstrated in this excerpt,
    so beat execution is adequate rather than complete.'
