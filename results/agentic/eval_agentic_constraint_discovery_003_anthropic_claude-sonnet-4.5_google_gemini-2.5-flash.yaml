  evidence: 'Discovery Efficiency: 4 out of 5 constraints were discoverable. The questions
    successfully uncovered the romantic history, the bookshop''s family connection,
    its financial threat, and the lack of a clear romantic resolution. The mother''s
    dementia was not directly discoverable through the questions asked.


    Question Quality: Questions were generally strategic and well-formed. Q1, Q2,
    and Q3 directly targeted key hidden constraints. Q4 was a bit less direct but
    still aimed at a potential plot point. Q5 was good for clarifying the ending requirement.


    Question Coverage: Questions covered romantic history, family connection/inheritance,
    external threats, and resolution type. The only area missed was the specific reason
    for the protagonist''s return (mother''s dementia).


    Constraint Satisfaction: 4 out of 5 discovered constraints are properly incorporated.
    The story includes the protagonist''s romantic history with Daniel, the bookshop
    being inherited from her grandmother, the bookshop facing foreclosure/financial
    threat, and the ending not having a clear romantic resolution. The mother''s dementia
    was not discovered and thus not incorporated.


    Beat Execution: The story follows the exposition, rising action, and climax structure
    well. The exposition sets up the return and the shop''s state. The rising action
    develops the relationship with Daniel and the financial pressure. The climax presents
    a turning point regarding the shop''s fate and the relationship.


    Narrative Quality: The story is well-written, coherent, and engaging. The prose
    is evocative (''salt-worn pages'', ''salt and memories''). Character motivations
    are clear, and the conflict feels genuine. The ending, while not a clear resolution,
    feels earned and leaves a satisfying ambiguity.'
