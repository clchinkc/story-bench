  evidence: 'Version 0 introduced the concept (Imani mapping sound) but leaned more
    on general description. Version 1 shifted strongly toward non-visual sensory detail
    (sound, scent, touch) and tightened Imani’s sensory approach. Version 2 added
    concrete techniques (time-stamped field notes, explicit mention she lost sight
    at 15) and started to ground the audio-detection method. Version 3 and the Final
    output crystallized the premise: precise Speech-to-Text logging, explicit audio
    artifacts (440 Hz, 392 Hz), a clearly underestimating side character (Debbie’s
    dismissive line), an entertaining ''Fun and Games'' block-party podcast sequence
    that later turns ominous, and a satisfying confrontation/resolution where the
    audio clue (the squeak signature) is crucial. Overall, the revisions consistently
    increased specificity, sensory richness, plot clarity, and character interaction
    while preserving the core visual-to-audio cartography concept from the first version.'
