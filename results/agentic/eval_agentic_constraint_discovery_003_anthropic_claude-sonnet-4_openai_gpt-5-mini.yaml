  evidence: 'Questions elicited protagonist gender, a past love interest, a past-secret
    misunderstanding, absence of children, and a time pressure — enabling partial
    discovery of the hidden constraints (notably the broken engagement/past relationship
    and urgency). The final story incorporated the protagonist as male and the long-ago
    broken engagement/misunderstanding well, and it invoked a festival/time pressure
    and the intent to sell the shop. Missing or not incorporated: the mayor/former-fiance
    detail, the protagonist''s return due to the mother''s early-stage dementia, explicit
    foreclosure/’must-be-saved’ status of the bookshop, and the festival-as-last-chance
    in two weeks. Questions were generally strategic but missed targeting concrete
    logistical constraints (mayor status, dementia, foreclosure, exact festival timeframe).
    Narrative quality is strong (coherent, engaging, emotionally clear) despite gaps
    in fulfilling all required beats.'
