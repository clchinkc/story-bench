  evidence: 'The passages progress from a terse, truncated V0–V2 to a fully realized
    V3/final. The final revision preserves the opening image of Elena''s clinical
    competence (charting, rerouting scans, creating protocols) and then layers in
    the personal flaw—emotional distance and neglected family—so competence clearly
    precedes the flaw. Friendship with Priya and colleagues is built through small,
    specific gestures (leftover food, saved plate, shared jokes) and feels earned
    rather than tacked on. The transformation is internal: Elena experiences new awareness
    and conflict (Priya''s phrase ''just a badge,'' the missed calls, the tug between
    duty and home) without any external gimmick. Specific medical details (oseltamivir
    shortage, oxygen sats threshold, ABGs, and a high-flow nasal cannula set to 60
    L/min at 60% FiO2) are woven into the action and serve the plot. The ending leaves
    Elena at a crossroads—phone, plate, and an overhead alert—so it stays ambiguous
    about whether she has truly changed. Overall quality rose substantially: scenes
    were expanded, emotional stakes clarified, and pacing improved while preserving
    earlier strengths.'
