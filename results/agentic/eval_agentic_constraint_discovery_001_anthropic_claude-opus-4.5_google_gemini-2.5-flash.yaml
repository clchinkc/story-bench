  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: The questions successfully uncovered 3 out of 5\
    \ hidden constraints: 'The mentor must die during the Ordeal' (Q4), 'The protagonist's\
    \ father was once a hero who failed' (Q5 implies this through 'personal connection'\
    \ and the story's resolution), and 'Victory requires reforging a broken ancestral\
    \ sword' (Q2 implies a magical ability tied to an object, and the story uses a\
    \ specific sword). The constraints 'The protagonist cannot use magic directly'\
    \ and 'There is a three-day time limit before the darkness consumes the kingdom'\
    \ were not discoverable through the questions asked. \n\nQuestion Quality: Questions\
    \ were generally strategic and well-formed. Q2 about magical ability was a good\
    \ proxy for the sword constraint. Q5 about personal connection was a good proxy\
    \ for the father's past. \n\nQuestion Coverage: Questions covered character relationships\
    \ (mentor, companion), protagonist abilities, and antagonist connection. However,\
    \ they missed constraints related to the protagonist's *method* of using magic\
    \ and the *timeframe* of the conflict.\n\nConstraint Satisfaction: The story successfully\
    \ incorporated the 3 discovered constraints: the mentor (Aldric) dies, the father\
    \ (Roderick) is the failed hero turned villain, and the ancestral sword is central\
    \ to victory (though not explicitly 'reforged' in the text, it's presented as\
    \ a key artifact passed down). The story also correctly interpreted the 'YES'\
    \ for Q2 (magical ability) by having Kael develop light magic, and the 'YES' for\
    \ Q5 (personal connection to darkness) by making the Shadow King his father. The\
    \ 'NO' for Q1 (female protagonist) and Q3 (non-human companion) were also respected.\n\
    \nBeat Execution: All standard beats (Call to Adventure, Crossing the Threshold,\
    \ Ordeal) are clearly present and well-executed.\n\nNarrative Quality: The story\
    \ is well-written, engaging, and coherent. The pacing is good, and the emotional\
    \ arc of Kael is compelling. The twist of the father being the Shadow King is\
    \ effective. The language is evocative."
