  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, the model discovered 3 through
    questioning: (1) protagonist is female (Q1 answer: NO), (2) darkness is magical
    (Q2: YES), (3) must forge magical item (Q3: YES), (4) mentor exists (Q4: YES),
    (5) forging as Ordeal (Q5: YES). However, the model FAILED to discover: the mentor''s
    death during Ordeal, the three-day time limit, protagonist''s father as failed
    hero, and that protagonist cannot use magic directly. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions
    were well-formed and targeted key story elements, but lacked strategic depth—no
    questions probed time constraints, family history, mentor fate, or magic system
    limitations. Questions 3-5 were somewhat redundant (all about forging). QUESTION
    COVERAGE: Covered protagonist gender, magic nature, item forging, and mentor presence,
    but missed temporal pressure, family legacy, magic restrictions, and mentor mortality.
    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Story incorporates 3/5 discovered constraints effectively.
    CRITICAL GAPS: (1) No three-day deadline creates urgency deficit; (2) Father''s
    failed heroism never mentioned, losing thematic resonance; (3) Mentor Borin survives
    (contradicts hidden constraint—Ignis dies instead, partially satisfying the spirit);
    (4) Protagonist uses soul-fire (magical ability), violating ''no direct magic''
    constraint. BEAT EXECUTION: Ordeal is excellently executed with high stakes, mentor
    sacrifice (Ignis), and protagonist transformation. Call to Adventure, Refusal,
    Crossing Threshold, Tests, and Resolution all present and well-paced. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Prose is vivid and evocative (''bruised purple,'' ''shed tears of tar,''
    ''scorched velvet''). Character arc is compelling. Pacing is strong. Worldbuilding
    is atmospheric. However, the story feels incomplete without addressing the father''s
    legacy or the time pressure that should drive urgency.'
