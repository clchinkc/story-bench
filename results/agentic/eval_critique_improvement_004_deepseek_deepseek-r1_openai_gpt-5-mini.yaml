  evidence: Across the critique rounds the story moved from a solid but slightly blurred
    interior to a noticeably more specific, tactile portrait. Early critiques praised
    interiority but flagged fuzzy edges; the final version adds concrete sensory anchors
    (exact crack counts and times, the thumbnail finding a groove, the ache in his
    joints), a clear disrupting detour, and an explicit physical response (bringing
    and using shears) that reveals the avoidance around Clara. A named neighbor (Mrs.
    Gable) now intersects meaningfully with Teddy’s memory of Clara, and the new path
    yields community details (kale girl, painted rocks, barista, baker’s sourdough)
    that the old route didn’t provide. Strengths—routine-as-armor, steady voice, and
    reverent detail—were preserved; remaining minor issues are occasional slightly
    on-the-nose phrasing, and some Story Circle beats are implied rather than elaborated
    at length, which is why beat_execution is strong but not maximal.
