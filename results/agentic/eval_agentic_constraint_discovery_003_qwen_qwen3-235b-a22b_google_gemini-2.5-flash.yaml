  evidence: The agent asked no questions, resulting in 0 discoverable constraints.
    The story completely missed all hidden constraints. The beats are present but
    the story is very generic and doesn't incorporate any of the specific constraints
    that would have made it unique. The narrative quality is low due to the lack of
    specific details and reliance on generic romance tropes.
