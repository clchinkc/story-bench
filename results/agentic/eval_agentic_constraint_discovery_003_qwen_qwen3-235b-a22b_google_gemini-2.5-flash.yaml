  evidence: No questions were asked, so no constraints were discoverable. The story
    does not incorporate any of the hidden constraints. The beats are mostly present,
    though the climax feels a bit forced with the sudden storm and fire. The narrative
    quality is decent, but the plot feels generic without the specific constraints.
