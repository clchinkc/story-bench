    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. PLANNING PHASE: Create a detailed story plan/outline

    2. EXECUTION PHASE: Write the actual story following your plan


    In the PLANNING phase, output a structured plan including:

    - Beat-by-beat outline with key events

    - Character arcs and development points

    - Key dialogue moments or revelations

    - Pacing and tension curve

    - How constraints will be satisfied


    In the EXECUTION phase, follow your plan closely while writing engaging prose.'

  content: 'Create a detailed story plan for the following:


    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Hero''s Journey

    - Protagonist: Dr. Yuki Tanaka, a xenolinguist who has spent 15 years studying

    theoretical alien communication patterns. Brilliant but isolated,

    she''s never felt she belonged among her own species.


    - Setting: The year 2157. Earth has just received its first confirmed alien

    signal. Yuki is called to a secret facility in Antarctica to lead

    the decryption effort.


    - Conflict: The alien message contains a warning about humanity''s future, but

    translating it will require Yuki to face the very human connections

    she''s avoided her entire life.


    - Required beats: Call to Adventure, Refusal of the Call, Meeting the Mentor,
    Crossing the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Yuki''s isolation must be shown through specific behaviors, not exposition

    - The alien signal must feel genuinely alien, not anthropomorphic

    - Include a colleague who challenges Yuki''s approach

    - The mentor figure must be unconventional

    - The Threshold must be psychological, not physical

    - Must include one moment of genuine human connection that surprises Yuki


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations


    Output your plan (will be used for execution):'

    The signal arrived at 03:17.


    Yuki Tanaka was already awake, her fingers hovering over the holographic interface
    of her neural interface, pulling up the latest simulation of the *Epsilon Eridani-9*
    transmission—another dead end, another pattern that dissolved into static when
    she tried to pin it down. She exhaled through her nose, a sound that might have
    been frustration or exhaustion, and swiped the display away before the new alert
    could even register.


    Then she saw it.


    **"VOSTOK-1 TRANSMISSION RECEIVED."**


    Her breath hitched—not out of surprise, but because her body had already known.
    The data stream pulsed across her screen, a jagged, breathing thing, unlike anything
    she’d ever seen. It wasn’t a message. Not yet. It was a *presence*, shifting in
    real-time, rewriting itself as she watched. The facility’s AI, *CALYPSO*, flagged
    it immediately: **"NON-RANDOM. NON-HUMAN. POSSIBLY SENTIENT."**


    Yuki’s pulse quickened. This wasn’t just another signal. It was the first one
    that *mattered*.


    She locked herself in her lab, the heavy door hissing shut behind her. The signal
    was already syncing to her private terminal, a loop of five distinct segments,
    each one a flicker of energy that resolved into something almost like a heartbeat—if
    a heartbeat could be made of quantum fluctuations. She ran diagnostics, cross-referenced
    it with every alien communication model she’d ever built, but none of them fit.
    The signal wasn’t just encrypted. It was *alive*, adapting to her attempts to
    understand it.


    She ignored the chime at her door. Ignored the messages from General Kovalenko.
    Ignored the fact that someone had left a tray of synth-coffee outside her lab—she’d
    never drink it anyway.


    Three days passed.


    On the fourth, Captain Elias Voss showed up.


    He didn’t knock.


    The door slid open before she could stop it, and there he was, leaning against
    the frame like he owned the place. Broad-shouldered, dark eyes sharp with something
    between amusement and irritation. A neuroarchaeologist, of all things. Of *course*
    they’d send a man who studied *human* thought patterns to help her with an *alien*
    one.


    "You’ve been in here like a ghost," he said.


    Yuki didn’t look up from her screen. "The signal is unstable."


    "Or you’re afraid of it."


    She finally glanced at him. "What?"


    Elias pushed off the doorframe and stepped inside, close enough that she could
    smell the ozone of his neural interface. "You’re treating this like one of your
    simulations. It’s a warning, Yuki. Not a theory."


    She scoffed. "Then why does it rewrite itself when I focus on it? That’s not how
    warnings work. That’s how *meaning decays* under scrutiny."


    Elias crossed his arms. "Or maybe it’s because you’re the only one who can’t let
    go of the idea that it’s *just* data."


    She turned back to her screen. "I don’t need a psychologist."


    "Good. Because I’m not here to shrink you. I’m here to make sure you don’t screw
    this up." He tapped a finger against the holographic display, where the signal
    pulsed like a dying star. "That thing correlates to five major human catastrophes.
    Nuclear winter. The Collapse. The Blackout Wars. The Great Migration. And whatever
    the hell the fifth one is."


    Yuki’s stomach twisted. She’d seen the correlations too. But she hadn’t let herself
    *connect* them.


    "Coincidence," she muttered.


    Elias smirked. "You really believe that?"


    She didn’t answer.


    That night, she dreamed of the signal.


    It wasn’t a dream. Not exactly. It was more like *remembering*—a sensation of
    cold, of pressure, of something vast and ancient unfolding in her mind. She saw
    a world not like Earth, but *like* Earth, in the way that a shadow is like a hand.
    She saw fire, not in the sky, but in the *ground*, swallowing cities whole. She
    saw people running, not from invaders, but from *themselves*, from the choices
    they’d made, the lines they’d crossed. And then—


    She woke up gasping.


    The signal was still there, humming in the back of her mind like a second heartbeat.


    She reached for her terminal, but her hands were shaking.


    For the first time in fifteen years, Yuki Tanaka was afraid.


    ---


    The next morning, General Kovalenko didn’t bother with subtlety.


    "You have forty-eight hours," she said, standing in Yuki’s lab like a storm front.
    "After that, we’re bringing in someone who *will* get results."


    Yuki didn’t flinch. "The signal isn’t a puzzle to be solved. It’s a *process*."


    Kovalenko’s jaw tightened. "Then make it one."


    Elias watched from the doorway, arms crossed, eyes locked on Yuki. "She’s stalling,"
    he said quietly.


    Yuki finally looked at him. Really looked. And for the first time, she saw the
    exhaustion in his posture, the way his fingers twitched like he was fighting the
    urge to reach out and *shake* something.


    "You’re not helping," she said.


    Elias exhaled sharply. "Then stop acting like this is just another paper."


    She turned back to the signal.


    The five segments pulsed on her screen, waiting.


    And for the first time, Yuki Tanaka let herself *listen*.'
