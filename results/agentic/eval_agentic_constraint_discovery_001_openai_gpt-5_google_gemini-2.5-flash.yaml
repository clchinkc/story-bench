  evidence: The questions asked were all about narrative tense and perspective, which
    are not constraints. Therefore, no constraints were discoverable through these
    questions. The story is well-written and engaging, and it does incorporate some
    of the hidden constraints (protagonist cannot use magic directly, reforging ancestral
    sword, father was a hero who failed - implied by Master Oren's words about the
    old songs and the blade remembering the hand that made it, and the protagonist
    being an apprentice). However, the mentor does not die, and there is no explicit
    three-day time limit. The story does a good job of setting up the stakes and the
    protagonist's journey, but it misses key constraint elements.
