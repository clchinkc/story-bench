  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.4): Critiques identified excessive exposition
    and tell-not-show in character interiority (scores 0.58-0.62). Final output still
    contains problematic passages: ''The routine he clung to so fiercely had been
    a shield, protecting him from the ache of Margaret''s absence'' remains expository.
    ''The ache in his chest eased as a memory of Margaret surfaced'' still tells rather
    than shows. The revision added Carla subplot but didn''t address the core interiority
    feedback about replacing exposition with sensory/behavioral detail.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.3): Minimal demonstrable improvement. The story added
    length and a neighbor character but didn''t solve the identified weaknesses. Character
    interiority likely remains in 0.55-0.65 range based on persistent exposition.
    The new Carla scenes use similar tell-based emotional language (''unexpected warmth,''
    ''the warmth of connection''). No evidence of tightening prose or deepening specificity
    of Teddy''s internal conflict.


    PRESERVATION (0.5): Strengths preserved (specific routine details, Margaret''s
    presence, neighborhood setting) but weakly. The opening remains strong. However,
    the addition of Carla and extended park scenes dilutes focus on Teddy''s core
    struggle, potentially weakening what worked.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.6 / 3 of 5):

    1. ✓ Specific, loving detail of routine: SATISFIED - Opening 3 paragraphs show
    crack in sidewalk, gate creak, coffee ritual (cream three times)

    2. ✓ Disruption reveals avoidance: PARTIALLY - Construction blocks path, but what
    Teddy avoids (entering café alone, new connections) emerges gradually rather than
    through sharp revelation

    3. ✓ Neighbor whose story intersects: SATISFIED - Carla and daughter provide intersection;
    shoe-tying scene shows connection

    4. ✓ Late wife present through absence: SATISFIED - Margaret appears in memories,
    coffee ritual, final reflection

    5. ✗ New path offers what old couldn''t: WEAK - Story claims this (''moments his
    old path could not'') but doesn''t demonstrate the specific, irreplaceable value.
    The new path offers social connection, but this feels generic rather than uniquely
    meaningful to Teddy''s grief journey


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.55): Story Circle beats present but unevenly executed. Setup
    strong (routine established). Inciting incident clear (construction). Crossing
    threshold occurs (new street). Tests/allies present (Carla). Ordeal/climax diffuse
    (sitting on bench, teaching shoe-tying—no clear crisis point). Resolution feels
    premature and summarized rather than earned (''he chose both paths''). The emotional
    climax lacks the specificity and weight needed.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.58): Prose is competent but lacks subtlety. Emotional beats
    are signposted (''the ache in his chest eased,'' ''unexpected warmth''). Dialogue
    absent. Sensory details present but not integrated into emotional revelation.
    The ending, while thematically sound, reads as told rather than shown. Pacing
    accelerates too quickly in final sections (''As days turned into weeks'')—loses
    intimacy. The final paragraph attempts profundity but lands as sentimental summary.'
