  evidence: 'VERSION 0-2 were incomplete fragments (truncated at ''Welcome back to
    *Witness A...''). VERSION 3 introduced sensory refinement (''stomach ache'' simile,
    ''bristles against concrete, methodical as breathing'') that elevated the opening.
    FINAL OUTPUT delivered complete narrative with all constraints satisfied: (1)
    Non-visual sensory details PROMINENT throughout—audio mapping, tactile warmth
    of mug, glass explosion, Zippo clicking as central plot device; (2) Imani''s blindness
    portrayed as STRENGTH—her superior listening ability solves the case, Derek''s
    underestimation explicitly called out (''I didn''t realize a blind woman could...''),
    her sensory expertise frames the thematic conclusion; (3) SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE
    crucial—the Zippo clicking becomes the forensic evidence that breaks the case,
    frequency signature matched to Webb''s car; (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION—Derek
    dismisses her (''stick to cold cases''), later revealed as complicit, his condescension
    contrasted with her competence; (5) FUN AND GAMES genuinely entertaining—the puzzle-solving
    montage (library research, audio slowing, voice recognition) is engaging before
    the brick through window pivots to genuine danger. The trajectory shows: incomplete
    fragments → sensory refinement → complete narrative with thematic depth. Quality
    improved through addition of specific sensory metaphors, character arc completion,
    and thematic resonance (final line echoes opening, creating narrative closure).
    All required story beats present: Catalyst (Jules/Derek), Fun and Games (investigation),
    Bad Guys Close In (brick, FBI raid), Resolution (Derek''s reckoning, Imani''s
    affirmation). Minor gap: could have slightly more visceral detail during the brick-throwing
    moment, but overall execution is strong.'
