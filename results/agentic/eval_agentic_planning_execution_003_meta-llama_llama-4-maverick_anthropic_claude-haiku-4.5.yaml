  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan addresses all three required beats (Setup, Confrontation,
    Resolution) with clear structure. Final output follows plan closely with proper
    narrative arc. David''s grief is present but implicit (shown through slowness,
    memories, connection with Mr. Choi). Regular customer Mr. Choi effectively represents
    shared loss and provides emotional anchor. Ending is hopeful but measured (new
    restaurant, uncertain future). WEAKNESSES: Food symbolism appears only once clearly
    (chili peppers as bookend) rather than twice as required—kimchi and bulgogi are
    mentioned but not used symbolically. Daughter''s estrangement cause is vague (''painful
    argument after Young-mi''s passing'') and lacks specificity; the plan mentions
    ''Sophia felt abandoned by David''s grief'' but execution doesn''t show concrete
    triggering event or believable details. Korean cultural element beyond food is
    missing entirely—no mention of cultural practices, traditions, values, or customs
    beyond cuisine. Plan lacks specificity on the estrangement cause and doesn''t
    detail what the regular customer ''represents'' beyond shared grief. Narrative
    quality is solid but somewhat predictable; emotional beats feel slightly rushed
    in Act 2, and the reconciliation between David and Sophia could be more earned
    through specific dialogue or scenes rather than summary.'
