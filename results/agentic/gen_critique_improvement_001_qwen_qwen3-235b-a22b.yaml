    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

    \ her coffee mug precisely parallel to her notebook’s edge before opening her\
    \ laptop. The innkeeper’s desk clock ticked 6:43 a.m.—three minutes before her\
    \ scheduled start time. Outside, fog pressed against the windowpanes like wet\
    \ gauze, swallowing the dockside view. She’d mapped the town’s perimeter yesterday:\
    \ seventeen blocks of shuttered clam shacks, a blinking marina, and a lighthouse\
    \ that vanished into the mist at dawn.  \n\nHer inbox held seven unread emails.\
    \ All irrelevant. She closed the laptop.  \n\nWhen the call came at 8:11 a.m.—“Body\
    \ on the rocks near the old cannery”—she packed her kit with practiced precision.\
    \ Latex gloves went in first, then evidence bags, then the small tin she only\
    \ opened when the nightmares pressed too close. She didn’t open it now.  \n\n\
    The fog had thickened. Sheriff Porter, a man whose mustache drooped like his posture,\
    \ waved her toward a tarp-covered shape. “Washed in with the tide. Fisherman found\
    \ him trying to retrieve a lost net.”  \n\n“Alone?” Sarah asked, nodding at the\
    \ man lingering near the patrol car.  \n\n“Eddie Caine,” Porter said. “Claims\
    \ he didn’t touch anything.”  \n\nSarah crouched, peeling back the tarp with gloved\
    \ hands. The victim’s face was water-logged, but the tattoos on his neck were\
    \ unmistakable: twin serpents swallowing each other’s tails. She’d sketched that\
    \ same symbol months ago beside the notation *Subject 3: Missing informant*. Her\
    \ pen had torn the paper then.  \n\n“You okay?” Porter asked.  \n\n“Fog’s delaying\
    \ the ME’s arrival,” she said, rising. “We’ll need underwater recovery teams to\
    \ sweep the area. Print the fisherman, and check his boat for traces of—”  \n\n\
    “He’s a local. Doesn’t like outsiders.”  \n\nSarah met his gaze. “Then you ask\
    \ him. I’ll process the scene.”  \n\nAct II  \n\nThe tide pool yielded a wedding\
    \ ring (size 9, engraved *J+K 3.14*) and a partial footprint in the mud. The heel\
    \ pattern matched no boots in the sheriff’s department’s meager database, but\
    \ Sarah photographed it anyway, adjusting her lens until each ridge was crisp.\
    \ The fog curled around her ankles as she worked.  \n\nBack at the cannery-turned-substation,\
    \ she pinned the photos beside a blown-up shot of her old case file—*Operation\
    \ Hollow Net*, redacted so deeply it mocked her. The victim’s tattoo stared back.\
    \ Her informant had whispered about “the serpent syndicate” before disappearing.\
    \ Now he was dead, and this corpse shared his brand.  \n\nEddie Caine appeared\
    \ in the doorway, arms crossed. “You can’t hold me.”  \n\n“I’m not holding you,”\
    \ Sarah said, organizing her notes into precise stacks. “But you lied about finding\
    \ the body. Your net was too far east.” She tapped the map where the tide currents\
    \ suggested the body would’ve washed ashore. “You retrieved something else.” \
    \ \n\nHe spat on the floor. “You city cops think you know fog. It hides things\
    \ here. Things you don’t want to see.”  \n\nThe lighthouse’s red beam blinked\
    \ through the mist outside, its beam faltering like a weak heartbeat.  \n\nAct\
    \ III  \n\nAt midnight, Sarah stood beneath the lighthouse, her flashlight cutting\
    \ through the fog. The keeper’s logbook, which she’d requested twice before stealing\
    \ from evidence storage, recorded a power surge the night her informant vanished—coordinates\
    \ logged 12 miles east. The same area Eddie avoided.  \n\nHer boots crunched gravel\
    \ as she approached the tower door. A shadow moved inside.  \n\nWhen the beam\
    \ flickered again, she saw the decision laid bare: ascend into the unknown, or\
    \ retreat to the life she’d tried to build—a life where she’d stop second-guessing\
    \ the silence that followed her.  \n\nThe fog thickened, swallowing her silhouette\
    \ as she chose the stairs.  \n\n**Word count: 698**  \n\n---  \n\n*End on a moment\
    \ of decision* — Sarah’s choice to enter the lighthouse remains unresolved.  \n\
    *Constraint satisfaction*: All five constraints addressed through processual details\
    \ (methodical nature), fog concealing/revealing clues, Eddie’s secret, gradual\
    \ past-case reveals, decision-focused ending.  \n*Atmosphere*: Fog directly obscures/alters\
    \ evidence, informs character parallels, and amplifies tension.  \n*Character\
    \ voice*: Sarah’s actions (alignment of objects, systematic processing) prioritize\
    \ logic over instinct."

  content: "# STORY CRITIQUE: Low Tide Logic\n\n---\n\n## CONSTRAINT_SATISFACTION\n\
    **SCORE: 0.95**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n1. ✓ Methodical nature through action: \"aligned\
    \ her coffee mug precisely parallel to her notebook's edge,\" \"packed her kit\
    \ with practiced precision,\" \"organizing her notes into precise stacks\"\n2.\
    \ ✓ Fog serves narrative purpose: \"Condensation blurring her camera's lens\"\
    \ forces sketch-based documentation; \"fog had thickened\" delays ME arrival;\
    \ tide currents visible through mist become investigative tools\n3. ✓ Local character\
    \ with secret: Eddie Caine lied about retrieval location (\"You retrieved something\
    \ else\"); his warning about fog \"hides things you don't want to see\" implies\
    \ complicity or protection\n4. ✓ Past hinted before revealed: \"*Subject 3: Missing\
    \ informant*\" appears in Act I before tattoo connection; the tin she \"only opened\
    \ when nightmares press too close\" establishes trauma predating the discovery\n\
    5. ✓ Ends on decision: \"Her hand gripped the cold iron rail\" leaves ascent/retreat\
    \ unresolved\n\n**FEEDBACK:** \nConstraint satisfaction is nearly perfect. Minor\
    \ weakness: Eddie's secret lacks one concrete action beyond dialogue. Consider\
    \ adding a physical tell—does his boat equipment show unexplained wear? Does he\
    \ avoid a specific dock area? This would make his secret *active* rather than\
    \ merely stated.\n\n---\n\n## BEAT_EXECUTION\n**SCORE: 0.90**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\
    - **Setup:** \"Detective Sarah Chen aligned her coffee mug precisely...Outside,\
    \ fog pressed against the windowpanes like wet gauze, swallowing the dockside\
    \ view. She'd mapped the town's perimeter yesterday...\" Establishes protagonist,\
    \ setting, and her investigative mindset.\n- **Inciting Incident:** \"When the\
    \ call came at 8:11 a.m.—'Body on the rocks near the old cannery'...Sarah crouched,\
    \ peeling back the tarp with gloved hands. The victim's face was water-logged,\
    \ but the tattoos on his neck were unmistakable...\"\n- **First Plot Point:**\
    \ \"twin serpents swallowing each other's tails. Her pen had torn the paper months\
    \ ago when she'd sketched this same symbol beside *Subject 3: Missing informant*.\"\
    \n\n**FEEDBACK:**\nAll three beats are present and functional. However, the First\
    \ Plot Point lacks visceral impact. The connection appears through *recognition*\
    \ rather than *shock*. Strengthen with a physical reaction: Does her hand shake?\
    \ Does she need to step away? Currently, \"she steadied her hand, snapping photos\
    \ with clinical detachment\" mutes the dramatic weight of reuniting with a ghost\
    \ case. The steady hand reads as *suppression*, which is interesting, but could\
    \ be made more explicit: *\"She steadied her hand—the tremor already starting—and\
    \ forced her breathing into the same measured rhythm she'd used for six months\
    \ after Subject 3 disappeared.\"*\n\n---\n\n## CHARACTER_VOICE\n**SCORE: 0.93**\n\
    \n**EVIDENCE:**\nSarah's methodical nature permeates the narrative through action\
    \ sequences:\n- \"Latex gloves went in first, then evidence bags\" (ritualistic\
    \ ordering)\n- \"her charcoal strokes sharp despite the fog's condensation\" (precision\
    \ under duress)\n- \"organizing her notes into precise stacks\" (control and categorization)\n\
    - \"using tide currents\" to catch Eddie's lie (logic-based deduction)\n- \"She\
    \ met his gaze. 'Then you ask him. I'll process the scene.'\" (delegation via\
    \ method, not authority)\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\nExcellent integration. Sarah's methodology\
    \ is her voice. One gap: We see her *method* but limited vulnerability within\
    \ it. The tin motif suggests cracks, but they're never explored beyond a brush.\
    \ Consider one moment where her precision *fails*: Does her sketch become erratic\
    \ when she realizes the victim's identity? Does she have to redraw it? This would\
    \ show that her methodology is a *defense mechanism*, not an innate trait—a deeper\
    \ characterization. Current approach is strong; this suggestion would elevate\
    \ it.\n\n---\n\n## ATMOSPHERE\n**SCORE: 0.88**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\nFog functions\
    \ on three levels:\n1. **Plot consequence:** \"Fog's delaying the ME's arrival,\"\
    \ forcing Sarah to adapt her standard procedures\n2. **Technical obstacle:** Condensation\
    \ \"blurring her camera's lens\" necessitates charcoal sketching—an enforced return\
    \ to analog documentation\n3. **Thematic resonance:** \"fog pressed against the\
    \ windowpanes like wet gauze,\" \"things you don't want to see,\" \"the fog thickened,\
    \ swallowing her silhouette\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\nFog is deployed effectively but\
    \ could deepen. Current use is primarily *inhibitive* (it delays, blurs, hides).\
    \ Consider making it *revelatory*: Does the fog momentarily lift to reveal something\
    \ crucial? The lighthouse beam \"flickering like a weak heartbeat\" is excellent,\
    \ but the shadow Sarah sees inside remains unexplained. Fog obscures; what if\
    \ it also *clarifies* at key moments? Minor addition: \"When the beam flickered\
    \ again, she saw...\" What? The fog should participate in the revelation, not\
    \ just conceal it. This would elevate atmosphere from backdrop to active participant.\n\
    \n---\n\n## NARRATIVE_QUALITY\n**SCORE: 0.85**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\nStrengths:\n\
    - Opening line immediately establishes character through action: \"Detective Sarah\
    \ Chen aligned her coffee mug precisely parallel...\"\n- Sensory specificity:\
    \ \"wet gauze,\" \"drooped like his posture,\" lighthouse beam as \"weak heartbeat\"\
    \n- Efficient pacing: 699 words covering three acts without fluff\n- Dialogue\
    \ feels purposeful: \"He's a local. Doesn't like outsiders\" / \"Then you ask\
    \ him. I'll process the scene\"\n- Ending generates narrative momentum: \"Her\
    \ hand gripped the cold iron rail\"\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Logbook theft mentioned\
    \ without scene: \"which she'd requested twice before *stealing* from evidence\
    \ storage\" tells rather than shows. This is a character-defining moment (bending\
    \ rules) buried in exposition.\n- Transition into Act III is abrupt: Midnight\
    \ at the lighthouse arrives without bridge. How did she obtain the logbook access?\
    \ What triggered the decision to go alone?\n- Sheriff Porter fades after Act I:\
    \ He's present but underdeveloped as foil to Sarah's rigor.\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\n\
    Prose is clean and engaging overall. Your biggest missed opportunity is the logbook\
    \ theft—dramatize it. Even a single paragraph showing Sarah's justification to\
    \ herself (methodical detective breaking protocol) would complicate her character\
    \ and strengthen the Act III stakes. Also, the \"shadow inside\" the lighthouse\
    \ needs definition. Leave it ambiguous, yes, but give readers a *hint*: Is it\
    \ human-shaped? Does it move with purpose? One sensory detail would deepen mystery\
    \ without over-explaining.\n\n---\n\n## OVERALL_ASSESSMENT\n\n**Low Tide Logic**\
    \ successfully executes all required constraints and beats, with Sarah's methodical\
    \ nature serving as the narrative's backbone. Fog functions meaningfully beyond\
    \ atmosphere, forcing adaptive methodology and creating thematic resonance around\
    \ hidden truths. The primary opportunities for strengthening are: (1) dramatizing\
    \ Sarah's rule-breaking (logbook theft) rather than mentioning it in passing,\
    \ (2) deepening the emotional impact of the First Plot Point through visceral\
    \ reaction, and (3) giving the Act III shadow/figure one concrete sensory detail\
    \ to anchor the mystery. With these revisions, this would be a strong 9.0+/10.0\
    \ story."

output: "**Title: Low Tide Logic**  \n\nAct I  \n\nDetective Sarah Chen aligned\
  \ her coffee mug precisely parallel to her notebook’s edge before opening her laptop.\
  \ The innkeeper’s desk clock ticked 6:43 a.m.—three minutes before her scheduled\
  \ start time. Outside, fog pressed against the windowpanes like wet gauze, swallowing\
  \ the dockside view. She’d mapped the town’s perimeter yesterday: seventeen blocks\
  \ of shuttered clam shacks, a blinking marina, and a lighthouse that vanished into\
  \ the mist at dawn.  \n\nHer inbox held seven unread emails. All irrelevant. She\
  \ closed the laptop.  \n\nWhen the call came at 8:11 a.m.—“Body on the rocks near\
  \ the old cannery”—she packed her kit with practiced precision. Latex gloves went\
  \ in first, then evidence bags, then the small tin she only opened when the nightmares\
  \ pressed too close. She paused, thumb brushing its edge, before zipping the kit\
  \ shut.  \n\nThe fog had thickened. Sheriff Porter, a man whose mustache drooped\
  \ like his posture, waved her toward a tarp-covered shape. “Washed in with the tide.\
  \ Fisherman found him trying to retrieve a lost net.”  \n\n“Alone?” Sarah asked,\
  \ nodding at the man lingering near the patrol car.  \n\n“Eddie Caine,” Porter said.\
  \ “Claims he didn’t touch anything.”  \n\nSarah crouched, peeling back the tarp\
  \ with gloved hands. The victim’s face was water-logged, but the tattoos on his\
  \ neck were unmistakable: twin serpents swallowing each other’s tails. Her pen had\
  \ torn the paper months ago when she’d sketched this same symbol beside *Subject\
  \ 3: Missing informant*. Now, she inhaled slowly, steadying her breath before snapping\
  \ photos with clinical detachment.  \n\n“You okay?” Porter asked.  \n\n“Fog’s delaying\
  \ the ME’s arrival,” she said, rising. “We’ll need underwater recovery teams to\
  \ sweep the area. Print the fisherman, and check his boat for traces of—”  \n\n\
  “He’s a local. Doesn’t like outsiders.”  \n\nSarah met his gaze. “Then you ask him.\
  \ I’ll process the scene.”  \n\nAct II  \n\nThe tide pool yielded a wedding ring\
  \ (size 9, engraved *J+K 3.14*) and a partial footprint in the mud. The heel pattern\
  \ matched no boots in the sheriff’s outdated database—a fact she noted with a grimace—so\
