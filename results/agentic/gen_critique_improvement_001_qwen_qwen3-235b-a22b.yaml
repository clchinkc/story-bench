    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

  content: "**STORY:**  \nThe fog clung to the cobblestones like wet gauze as Detective\
    \ Sarah Chen stepped into the sheriff’s office, her boots clicking precise rhythms\
    \ against the floor. She’d arranged the case files in alphabetical order before\
    \ her first coffee break—*routine kept the past at bay*. Outside, the Atlantic\
    \ wind rattled the shutters of the empty souvenir shops. This town breathed secrets\
    \ through its salt-crusted pores.  \n\nA teenage boy stumbled into the station\
    \ at dawn, his raincoat slick with seawater. “There’s something on the rocks by\
    \ the pier,” he muttered. Sheriff Porter, a man whose gut sagged like his distrust\
    \ of outsiders, waved a ham-sized hand. “We’ll handle it.” But Sarah was already\
    \ pulling on her gloves.  \n\nThe body lay half-submerged, face-down, the fog\
    \ so thick it blurred the line between sea and sky. She crouched, her gloved fingers\
    \ skimming the victim’s sodden jacket—*male, mid-30s, no visible trauma*. Porter\
    \ lit a cigarette, the ember flaring in the gloom. “Probably a drifter who fell\
    \ off a boat.”  \n\nSarah didn’t answer. Her eyes traced the man’s wrist, where\
    \ a silver chain glinted beneath encrusted salt. She tugged gently; the chain\
    \ held fast, anchored under his shirt. When she lifted the fabric, her breath\
    \ hitched.  \n\nA tattoo: a coiled serpent, fangs bared.  \n\n*Same as the man\
    \ who drowned in the Hudson last year. Same as the file she’d buried in her desk\
    \ drawer back in Boston.*  \n\n“Know him?” Porter asked, ash falling into the\
    \ tidepool.  \n\n“Every case leaves fingerprints,” she said, pocketing the evidence\
    \ bag. Back at the station, she’d cross-reference the ink, but her mind was already\
    \ running ahead—*methodically, always methodically*—to the ledger of men who’d\
    \ vanished after testifying against a smuggling ring. The ring her witness had\
    \ survived to betray.  \n\nThe fog worsened by noon, swallowing the diner where\
    \ she’d sat alone, its windows fogged with condensation. Mrs. Rigby, the owner,\
    \ wiped a tumbler with a rag, her eyes lingering on Sarah’s badge. “You’re chasing\
    \ ghosts here,” she said, as if confessing. When Sarah asked about transient workers\
    \ at the cannery, the woman’s knuckles whitened on the glass.  \n\n*Secrets: plural.*\
    \  \n\nIn her rented room above the bait shop, Sarah unfolded the newspaper clipping\
    \ she’d saved: *“Whistleblower Survives Drowning Attempt.”* The photo showed a\
    \ man with a serpent tattoo, alive, grinning beside a fishing boat. The article\
    \ was dated three weeks before her botched arrest—the one that ended in a shootout,\
    \ a suspended partner, and transfer papers.  \n\nThe dead man’s chain held a locket,\
    \ cracked open when she pried it free. Inside: a micro SD card.  \n\nShe could\
    \ hear Porter’s voice from the pier, shouting that the tides were rising. The\
    \ foghorn blared, a sound like a wounded animal.  \n\nSarah stared at the card\
    \ on her palm. The sheriff would say this wasn’t her jurisdiction. The town would\
    \ vanish under the mist soon, the world narrowed to the next breath, the next\
    \ step.  \n\nHer laptop blinked awake. The card’s file was encrypted, but the\
    \ password field felt like a dare.  \n\nShe typed: *S-E-R-P-E-N-T.*  \n\nThe screen\
    \ opened to a spreadsheet of shipments. Dates, codes, a ledger of guilt—and names.\
    \ One of them hers.  \n\nThe fog had hidden the body long enough for someone to\
    \ erase the pier’s security footage. It had hidden the sheriff’s lies, Mrs. Rigby’s\
    \ fear. Now it pressed against her window, patient, as if waiting for her to choose:\
    \ dive back into the current, or let the tide sweep it all away.  \n\nSarah booted\
    \ up her burner phone.  \n\nTwo choices: report up, or call the one person she’d\
    \ sworn never to trust again.  \n\nThe fog thickened.  \n\nShe dialed.  \n\n**REQUIRED\
    \ BEATS:**  \n- **Setup:** Sarah’s methodical habits, the town’s hostility, the\
    \ fog’s oppressive presence.  \n- **Inciting Incident:** The body’s discovery\
    \ reveals the tattoo, linking to her past.  \n- **First Plot Point:** The SD card\
    \ exposes her compromised case—and her own name.  \n\n**CONSTRAINTS SATISFIED:**\
    \  \n- Methodical traits shown through actions (organizing files, precise evidence\
    \ collection).  \n- Fog enables obfuscation of the body and surveillance gaps.\
    \  \n- Mrs. Rigby and Porter both harbor secrets.  \n- Past case hinted via internal\
    \ monologue and clipping before SD card reveal.  \n- Ends on Sarah’s call, a decision\
    \ without resolution.  \n\n**Word count:** ~680"
