  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing how each constraint
    and beat will be addressed. The final output adheres perfectly to this detailed
    plan. All 6 constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through her behavior
    (ignoring messages, staying in lab, not drinking coffee), the alien signal is
    genuinely alien (rewrites itself, cognitive fingerprint, sensation-based), Elias
    challenges Yuki''s approach, Elias is an unconventional mentor (neuroarchaeologist,
    challenges her directly), the threshold is psychological (her fear and willingness
    to listen), and the human connection is surprising (Elias''s exhaustion and her
    noticing it). All 4 beats are clearly executed. The narrative quality is high,
    with good pacing and tension.'
