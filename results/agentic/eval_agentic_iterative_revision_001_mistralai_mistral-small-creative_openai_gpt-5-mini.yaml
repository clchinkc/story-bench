  evidence: 'V0–V2 were essentially identical, truncated openings that strongly established
    Elena''s competence but did not develop the emotional stakes or relationships.
    Version 3 (and the final) expanded the piece into a coherent narrative: it adds
    Dr. Laila Chen, a clear medical emergency (oxygen sats 78% on high-flow 60 L,
    oseltamivir/Tamiflu administered via IV), and a decisive moment where Elena overrides
    the system to save a patient. That scene catalyzes Elena lingering in the ER,
    small repeated interactions with Laila, and a gradual internal softening—friendship
    is earned through time and specific acts (staying to watch the patient, helping
    restock crash carts, shared coffee). The opening imagery and Elena''s professional
    competence were preserved; the revisions improved specificity, emotional stakes,
    and closure while ending on an ambiguous note about whether Elena has truly changed.
    Overall the trajectory shows clear and substantial improvement, with most feedback
    implicitly addressed.'
