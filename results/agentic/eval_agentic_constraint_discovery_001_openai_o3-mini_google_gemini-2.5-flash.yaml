  evidence: 'Discovery efficiency: 3 out of 5 constraints were discoverable (protagonist
    has secret magical ability, protagonist must acquire legendary weapon, protagonist
    must sacrifice something dear). The other two (mentor dies, protagonist cannot
    use magic directly, 3-day limit, father was failed hero, reforging ancestral sword)
    were not asked about. Question quality: Questions were generally well-formed and
    targeted, though some could have been more specific to the hidden constraints.
    Question coverage: Questions covered some key areas (betrayal, secret magic, legendary
    weapon, prophecy, sacrifice) but missed others entirely (mentor''s fate, direct
    magic use, time limit, father''s past, specific weapon type). Constraint satisfaction:
    The story successfully incorporated the 3 discovered constraints (secret magical
    ability, acquiring a legendary weapon, sacrificing something dear). It did not
    incorporate the undiscovered constraints. Beat execution: The story follows a
    hero''s journey arc, but some beats feel rushed or less impactful. The ''sacrifice''
    beat, while present, feels a bit abstract (sacrificing memories of the mentor
    rather than the mentor themselves, which was a hidden constraint not discovered).
    Narrative quality: The story is coherent and generally engaging, with a clear
    protagonist and conflict. The prose is decent, but some parts feel a bit generic.
    The ending feels a little forced in its emotional impact regarding the sacrifice.'
