  evidence: 'Early revision snippets shown (Versions 0–3) were essentially truncated/formulaic
    openings. The final version expands those seeds into a fuller scene: it preserves
    the comedic craft details (beat/tag/callback, page-eight directive, pitching notes)
    while adding clear emotional beats (Nina''s grief, Marcus''s physical tremor,
    the Sharpie spill and his cover joke, the theme line delivered by Kendra). This
    progression demonstrates the author responded to critiques about emotional complexity
    and character vulnerability, moving from a mostly mechanical writers'' room vignette
    to a scene that balances humor and pathos and satisfies all task constraints.'
