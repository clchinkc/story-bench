  evidence: The revisions consistently addressed the feedback, particularly around
    balancing humor and pathos and refining the emotional arc. The initial versions
    were a bit too heavy on the sadness, and the humor felt forced. The final version
    successfully integrates the humor more naturally before revealing Marcus's underlying
    sadness. The constraint about the new writer not being naive was well-executed,
    and the moment Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke was subtly and effectively
    woven in. The theme being stated by a minor character (Ravi) was also well-placed.
    The overall narrative quality improved significantly, feeling more authentic and
    emotionally resonant.
