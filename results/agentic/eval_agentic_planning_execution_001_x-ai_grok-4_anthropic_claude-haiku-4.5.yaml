  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with detailed beat-by-beat structure
    and clear thematic anchors. Output executes most constraints effectively: (1)
    False lead (Elias Grant) is clearly pursued with planted evidence; (2) Unconventional
    profiling (echo mapping with rain recordings and sensory immersion) is creative
    and well-integrated; (3) Ticking clock (72-hour storm deadline) is explicit and
    drives tension; (4) Betrayal (Riley''s FBI collusion) is well-executed with emotional
    impact; (5) Midpoint confrontation (warehouse standoff with Voss/Riley) is dialogue-driven,
    non-physical, and emotionally charged; (6) Past failure confrontation (Sarah''s
    death, hesitation guilt) is explicit and emotionally resonant. All four required
    beats present: Catalyst (anonymous email/body discovery), Debate (internal conflict
    about involvement), Break into Two (decision to pursue despite FBI warning), Midpoint
    (warehouse confrontation). WEAKNESSES: (1) One constraint partially underexecuted—the
    ''unconventional profiling technique'' while creative, could be more thoroughly
    demonstrated in practice (only shown once in detail). (2) Pacing in output feels
    slightly rushed in final act; the warehouse confrontation, while effective, lacks
    the spatial/sensory detail given to earlier scenes. (3) The false lead (Elias)
    resolves too quickly without deeper investigation—could have extended the misdirection
    longer for greater impact. (4) Riley''s character arc from ally to betrayer, while
    functional, lacks sufficient foreshadowing in earlier interactions to feel inevitable
    rather than convenient. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong atmospheric writing (rain as
    motif), effective use of Seattle setting, good psychological depth with Marcus''s
    guilt. Dialogue is sharp. Tension escalates appropriately. However, the climactic
    confrontation, while emotionally effective, feels slightly underdeveloped compared
    to setup. The story hooks well but leaves reader wanting more concrete resolution
    hints.'
