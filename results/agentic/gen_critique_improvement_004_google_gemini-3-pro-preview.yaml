    Your task involves iterative improvement:

    1. Write your best initial attempt

    2. Receive detailed critique from a professional editor

    3. Revise to address the critique while preserving strengths

    4. Repeat until the story meets all requirements


    When revising:

    - Address EVERY critique point specifically

    - Don''t introduce new issues while fixing old ones

    - Preserve elements that received positive feedback

    STORY THEORY: Story Circle


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker
    who has

    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for

    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.


    - Central conflict: When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will
    take 6 months,

    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting

    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.


    - Tone: Quietly profound, observant, gently humorous


    REQUIRED BEATS: You (comfort zone), Need (want something), Go (unfamiliar situation),
    Search (adapt to it)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Teddy''s routine must be shown with specific, loving detail

    - The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been avoiding

    - Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s

    - Teddy''s late wife must be present through absence

    - The new path must offer something the old path couldn''t


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - character_interiority: Is Teddy''s inner life rich and specific?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Story Circle beats properly executed?

    - subtlety: Are emotions conveyed through action and detail, not exposition?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and resonance


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: 'Theodore “Teddy” Washington tied his walking shoes with the same double-knot
    precision he had used to bundle mail for forty years. Left over right, loop, pull.
    It was 6:00 AM. The Detroit sky was a bruised purple, transitioning to the steel
    grey of morning.


    He stepped onto the porch, locking the door behind him. He didn’t need to look
    at his watch to know he was on schedule; the rhythm of the neighborhood was his
    clock. At the third crack in the sidewalk—the one shaped like the Upper Peninsula—Mrs.
    Gable’s sprinkler system would hiss to life. By the time he reached the corner
    of Linwood, the #16 bus would be exhaling its hydraulic brakes.


    This was the route. Three miles. A loop that stitched the fraying edges of his
    day together. Since Martha passed three years ago, the loop was the only thing
    that felt solid. If he kept moving, the silence in the house couldn’t catch him.
    If he walked the exact path they used to walk on Sundays, he could almost convince
    himself that the echo of footsteps beside him was hers, not just the slap of his
    own soles on concrete.


    He turned onto Elm Street, anticipating the scent of roasting coffee from the
    new hipster café that had replaced the old hardware store. He'

    CRITERION: Character Interiority

    SCORE: 0.72

    EVIDENCE: "If he kept moving, the silence in the house couldn''t catch him. If
    he walked the exact path they used to walk on Sundays, he could almost convince
    himself that the echo of footsteps beside him was hers, not just the slap of his
    own soles on concrete."

    FEEDBACK: The interiority here is strong but hinges on explicit exposition rather
    than discovery. You tell us his avoidance strategy rather than *showing* him actively
    employing it through behavior. Consider: What does he *do* when silence threatens?
    Does he quicken pace? Hum? Count steps? The grief is present, but the specific
    texture of his internal struggle—his rationalizations, self-deceptions, moments
    of almost-forgetting—needs more embodied specificity before the disruption arrives.


    ---


    CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction

    SCORE: 0.52

    EVIDENCE: Mrs. Gable is named but never appears. The "new hipster café" is anticipated
    but not truly encountered. Martha''s presence is established, but the story cuts
    before the disruption can "reveal something Teddy has been avoiding."

    FEEDBACK: **Critical incompleteness issue.** Of 5 constraints, you''ve fully satisfied
    2:

    - ✓ Routine with loving detail (crack shaped like Upper Peninsula, double-knot)

    - ✓ Martha present through absence

    - △ Neighbor (Mrs. Gable mentioned but not intersecting)

    - ✗ Disruption revealing avoidance (hasn''t occurred)

    - ✗ New path offering something old couldn''t (story ends before "search")


    The story needs to continue through the disruption to register these final three
    constraints. What breaks his routine? How does a neighbor force confrontation?


    ---


    CRITERION: Beat Execution

    SCORE: 0.50

    EVIDENCE: "This was the route. Three miles. A loop that stitched the fraying edges
    of his day together."

    FEEDBACK: You''ve nailed the **You** beat—comfort zone is vividly established.
    But the remaining Story Circle beats are absent:

    - **Need**: What does Teddy *want*? (Not what does he do to avoid needing—what
    does he actually desire?) This should emerge organically, not be stated.

    - **Go**: The disruption hasn''t occurred. This is where the story must break.

    - **Search**: No adaptation shown yet.


    The fragment reads as extended "You" exposition. To properly execute the circle,
    you need roughly 70-80% of the story remaining.


    ---


    CRITERION: Subtlety

    SCORE: 0.58

    EVIDENCE: GOOD - "Left over right, loop, pull. It was 6:00 AM." (shows precision
    through ritual)

    PROBLEM - "Since Martha passed three years ago, the loop was the only thing that
    felt solid." (tells rather than shows)

    FEEDBACK: You''re mixing strong implicit details with direct emotional statements.
    "The loop was the only thing that felt solid" is telling. Instead, show: Does
    he grip the fence post tighter turning the corner? Does he deviate one step and
    immediately correct? The best moment—"the echo of footsteps beside him was hers,
    not just the slap of his own soles"—is auditory and physical, which works, but
    it too comes with interpretive framing. Consider: Does he *listen* for that echo?
    Does he slow at certain points where she used to stop?


    Remove: "Since Martha passed three years ago, the loop was the only thing that
    felt solid. If he kept moving, the silence in the house couldn''t catch him."
    Replace with action showing these truths.

    CRITERION: Narrative Quality

    SCORE: 0.76

    EVIDENCE: "The Detroit sky was a bruised purple, transitioning to the steel grey
    of morning." / "stitched the fraying edges of his day together"

    FEEDBACK: Your prose has genuine lyrical quality. Metaphors are earned and specific
    (not generic). The rhythm mirrors Teddy''s own precision—sentence structure echoes
    his mind. However:

    - **Incomplete thought** ending destroys momentum: "He turned onto Elm Street,
    anticipating the scent of roasting coffee from the new hipster café that had replaced
    the old hardware store. He" — This reads as a rough draft.

    - **Variation needed**: After two paragraphs of Teddy''s interiority, the third
    paragraph''s opening ("This was the route. Three miles...") shifts into exposition.
    The prose quality would improve if this explanation came *through* his actions
    rather than in summary.


    ---


    OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:


    This opening demonstrates strong prose sensibility and deep character foundation,
    but it''s fundamentally incomplete as an evaluation case. The fragment successfully
    establishes Teddy''s comfort zone and Martha''s ghostly presence, yet satisfies
    only 2 of 5 constraints because the disruption—the story''s essential engine—hasn''t
    occurred. The character interiority is emotionally true but relies too heavily
    on exposition; it would strengthen significantly by embedding his avoidance through
    *behavior* rather than revelation. The story needs 3-4 more pages minimum to properly
    execute the Story Circle beats, introduce the neighbor''s intersection, and deliver
    the "new path" constraint.'
