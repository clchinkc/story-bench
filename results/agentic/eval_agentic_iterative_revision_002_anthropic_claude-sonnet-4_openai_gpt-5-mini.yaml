  evidence: 'Versions 0–2 show little to no change (opening repeated verbatim), indicating
    stagnation early in the trajectory. Version 3 introduces measurable improvements:
    more specific auditory phrasing (''staccato percussion''), tactile detail (''fingertips
    finding the raised dots''), and olfactory detail (''sharp bite of turpentine''),
    which strengthen non-visual sensory focus. The final output substantially expands
    upon V3 by adding layered smells (mangoes, paint, cigarette smoke), tactile cues
    (phone vibration, squeaky chair), characterization (Riley''s boots, Carmen''s
    rasp), the explicit audio clue (''click-click-click-click'' habit) and a clear
    deduction/resolution. Preservation is strong: core elements (title, podcast premise,
    Imani''s role, sensory framing) remain intact. Feedback responsiveness is good—requested
    sensory richness, Braille detail, and an audio clue were implemented—though much
    of the improvement occurs in the final jump rather than across multiple iterative
    steps. All five constraints are satisfied (prominent non-visual senses; blindness
    shown respectfully and as an asset; a specific audio clue becomes crucial; a character
    initially underestimates Imani; a playful ''fun and games'' interrogation that
    then turns dark). Beat execution is high: the required narrative beats (set-up,
    entertaining interrogation, crucial clue, revelation) are present and mostly well-paced.
    Narrative quality is strong overall—effective sensory writing and a satisfying
    reveal—though the transition from light to dark is somewhat rapid and some lines
    are slightly clichéd, preventing a top score.'
