  evidence: 'VERSION 0-1 (truncated, incomplete assessment): Establishes Elena''s
    competence through efficient chart-signing, proactive problem-solving (rerouting
    scans, flagging vitals), and earned respect from colleagues. VERSION 3 (final):
    Substantially improves opening prose rhythm (''she''d used'' vs ''she used'';
    ''moved through it like it belonged to her'' adds interiority). The friendship
    beat is earned through specific details: Priya''s wordless coffee/takeout, the
    ''nose charger'' anecdote showing genuine camaraderie, Jamal''s bet revealing
    established patterns. Elena''s flaw (emotional avoidance, choosing work over family)
    is revealed through action (dismissing calls, fleeing to the ED) rather than exposition.
    The medical detail (nasal cannula at 88% sats/96% on oxygen, oseltamivir shortage,
    ABGs with specific FiO₂ settings) serves character—Elena''s competence is credible
    because medicine is precise. Internal transformation is evident: Elena recognizes
    her life has ''become small,'' experiences genuine laughter, feels ''fear'' at
    calling back, and the final ambiguity (hand hovering, alert interrupting, ''which
    way she would turn'') perfectly captures whether change will stick. The ending
    resists resolution—she hasn''t called yet, the hospital still pulls, Priya''s
    plate is still an offer. Across revisions: prose tightened, emotional stakes deepened,
    the break room scene expanded to show earned friendship rather than telling it,
    the mother''s voicemail added vulnerability, and the final moment crystallized
    the central tension. All five constraints satisfied: competence shown first (opening
    14 hours of efficiency), friendship genuine and earned (specific moments, not
    summary), transformation internal (recognition without action yet), medical detail
    integrated (nasal cannula scene), ambiguity preserved (final moment unresolved).'
