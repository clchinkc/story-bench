  evidence: 'PLAN ASSESSMENT: The plan comprehensively addresses all required constraints
    and beats with strong specificity. Act 1 setup clearly establishes David''s grief
    through ritualistic kimchi burial and the demolition crisis. The inciting incident
    (Emily''s call, estrangement cause) is concrete: Emily resents David''s absence
    during her mother''s illness and his prioritization of the restaurant over her
    graduation. Act 2 midpoint confrontation is well-structured with direct dialogue
    clash. The plan includes two symbolic food uses (kimchi burial, bibimbap recipe),
    Mr. Kim as regular customer representing Seoul/memory, and bentook basket as Korean
    cultural element. Resolution hints at hopeful but realistic outcome (new storefront,
    reconciliation beginning). Minor gap: plan doesn''t fully detail how the Jesa
    ceremony (mentioned in output) was planned.


    OUTPUT ASSESSMENT: Execution is strong. CONSTRAINT 1 (Food symbolism x2): Kimchi
    burial (memory/ritual) and bibimbap (grief/connection) both function symbolically.
    ✓ CONSTRAINT 2 (Implicit grief): David''s grief permeates through actions—dawn
    rituals, basement sanctuary, tears while cooking, humming Mi-jung''s song—never
    explicitly stated as ''I grieve.'' ✓ CONSTRAINT 3 (Specific estrangement cause):
    Emily''s resentment clearly rooted in David missing her recital and her mother''s
    chemo session for restaurant priorities. Believable and specific. ✓ CONSTRAINT
    4 (Regular customer): Mr. Kim appears twice, represents Seoul/memory/continuity,
    delivers thematic wisdom. ✓ CONSTRAINT 5 (Hopeful but realistic ending): New storefront
    two blocks away, tentative reconciliation (Emily''s laugh, teasing), but David
    still carries grief (glances back, ''ghosts eat bland food''). Not unrealistically
    happy. ✓ CONSTRAINT 6 (Korean cultural element beyond food): Bentook basket, Arirang
    folk song, Jesa ceremony (ancestor offering), perilla leaves. ✓


    BEAT EXECUTION: Act 1 setup (demolition notice, Mr. Kim, Emily''s call, childhood
    drawings) clearly established. Act 2 confrontation (day 4 clash, suitcase, basement
    discovery of recipe journal) properly executed with emotional escalation. Act
    3 resolution (Mr. Kim''s jar, Jesa ceremony, new storefront) provides closure.
    All three beats present and functional.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is lyrical and evocative (''cracked like dried persimmons,''
    ''steam blurred the past''). Pacing moves effectively through four days. Tension
    builds from demolition through family conflict to reconciliation. Sensory details
    (scallions, gochujang stain, soju burn) ground the narrative. Dialogue feels natural.
    Metaphorical language (''grave,'' ''sanctuary,'' ''unbroken thread'') reinforces
    themes. Minor weakness: the Jesa ceremony feels slightly rushed in execution compared
    to its setup; could use one more scene of preparation or Emily''s participation
    to deepen the moment.


    OVERALL: Exceptional execution of a complex brief. The model successfully balanced
    multiple constraints without sacrificing narrative coherence or emotional authenticity.
    The story earns its hopefulness through earned reconciliation rather than convenient
    resolution.'
