  evidence: 'PLAN ANALYSIS: The plan establishes clear structure with specific beats
    (demolition notice, Mr. Cho''s arrival, Emily''s phone call). It identifies symbolic
    food use (soondubu as memory anchor, miyeokguk as ritual), David''s implicit grief
    (trembling hands, photo references), and Emily''s estrangement cause (David''s
    post-Mi-Ja isolation). Mr. Cho is positioned as grief-mirror. However, the plan
    outline is truncated mid-sentence, reducing perceived completeness slightly.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (6/6): (1) Food symbolism: soondubu represents first love/memory;
    miyeokguk represents ritual and luck—used twice with thematic weight. (2) David''s
    grief: Present throughout via photo references, trembling hands, oxygen machine
    flashback, kitchen isolation—never explicitly stated as ''grief.'' (3) Estrangement
    cause: Emily left because David ''never left the kitchen after her funeral''—specific,
    believable, rooted in psychological realism. (4) Regular customer: Mr. Cho (82)
    represents parallel grief and validates the restaurant''s meaning. (5) Hopeful
    but realistic ending: Pop-up food truck venture is modest, uncertain (''They''d
    start...''), not a triumphant resolution. Reconciliation is tentative (''I''ll
    help''). (6) Korean cultural element beyond food: Hangari (Korean chess set) appears
    as artifact; seaweed soup tradition for luck; red envelope with handwritten recipe
    card; songpyeon preparation—multiple elements woven throughout.


    BEAT EXECUTION (3/3): Act 1 Setup: Demolition notice, photo, Mr. Cho''s arrival
    establish stakes and David''s isolation. Act 2 Confrontation: Emily''s accusation
    (''You buried Mom here'') forces David to confront grief-avoidance; the food truck
    rejection escalates tension. Act 3 Resolution: Collaborative cooking, the discovered
    recipe card, decision to continue via pop-up—provides forward momentum without
    false resolution.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Pacing is tight with effective sensory details (sesame oil
    shimmer, fermenting cabbage tang, jackhammer throbbing). Dialogue carries subtext
    well. The ending balances hope (recipes survive, relationship mending) with realism
    (uncertain future, modest venture). Emotional arc is earned through specific actions
    rather than telling. Minor weakness: the transition from Emily''s hotel stay to
    her appearing Monday morning could be slightly clearer, though the scrubbing-graffiti
    image effectively shows her commitment shift.'
