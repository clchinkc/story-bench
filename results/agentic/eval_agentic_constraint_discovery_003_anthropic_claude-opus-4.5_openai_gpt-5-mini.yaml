  evidence: 'The question sequence discovered and the story incorporated three hidden
    elements: the love interest is a local (Jo), the autumn festival is central to
    bringing characters together, and there is unresolved family conflict (Margaret
    and her brother). Missed/discovered-but-incorrect elements: the second-chance/broken-engagement
    backstory (hidden: left 20 years after a broken engagement) was not found (story
    presents a fresh romance and a 15-year absence), the protagonist''s return reason
    (hidden: mother''s early-stage dementia) was not discovered and the story instead
    gives a prior funeral, and the urgent financial stakes (bookshop foreclosure /
    festival as last chance) and the former-fiance-mayor reveal were not asked about
    or included. Questions were generally clear and targeted to relationship, community
    role, festival role, family tension, and staying decision, but they failed to
    probe specific motivations and high-stakes plot constraints (caregiving/dementia,
    foreclosure, ex-fiancé/mayor), limiting discovery. Overall the narrative is coherent
    and engaging but omits several required hidden constraints and stakes.'
