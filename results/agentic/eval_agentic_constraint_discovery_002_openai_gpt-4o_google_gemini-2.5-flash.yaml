  evidence: 'Only one constraint was discoverable through the questions: ''The AI
    has formed an attachment to one specific human child'' (Q3). The other questions
    did not lead to the discovery of the other hidden constraints. The questions were
    somewhat targeted but missed key areas. The story successfully incorporated the
    discovered constraint about the AI''s attachment to a human, but none of the other
    hidden constraints were present. The beats are mostly present, though some are
    weakly executed (e.g., ''Midpoint'' feels more like a continuation of ''Fun and
    Games''). The narrative is coherent but lacks significant conflict or depth due
    to the missed constraints.'
