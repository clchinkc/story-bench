  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Tightened prose (removed redundant ''was respected. She
    wa...''), introduced ''Alone'' as thematic anchor. VERSION 1→2: Further compression,
    removed unnecessary commas, improved rhythm. VERSION 2→FINAL: Substantial expansion
    that fulfills all constraints. Elena''s competence is demonstrated exhaustively
    in opening (smell distinction, voice tremor detection, 7-min bed clearing, quiet
    authority). Her flaw emerges clearly: identity entirely dependent on hospital
    role, fear of invisibility without work, emotional isolation. Friendship with
    Aisha feels genuinely earned through incremental moments (supply closet talks,
    coffee, shoulder touch, community fair) rather than imposed. Medical detail (viral
    pneumonia secondary to influenza, oseltamivir, SpO₂ climbing to 92, prone positioning)
    serves narrative by grounding Elena''s competence and providing context for meeting
    Aisha. Transformation is internal: Elena''s knot loosens, she steps outside hospital
    walls, shares childhood stories—but ending maintains ambiguity (''didn''t know
    if the loneliness had truly loosened, or if she''d simply learned to carry it
    differently''). The final image returns to ventilator hum, suggesting cyclical
    nature rather than resolution. Constraint 1 (competence before flaw): ✓ Opening
    4 paragraphs establish mastery. Constraint 2 (genuine friendship): ✓ Built through
    6+ specific interactions. Constraint 3 (internal transformation): ✓ No external
    changes, only emotional/perceptual shifts. Constraint 4 (medical detail): ✓ Viral
    pneumonia secondary to influenza with specific clinical markers. Constraint 5
    (ambiguous ending): ✓ Final paragraph explicitly questions whether change is real.
    Minor weakness: Aisha''s characterization could be slightly deeper, and the health
    fair scene moves quickly. Overall trajectory shows disciplined revision prioritizing
    clarity and constraint satisfaction.'
