  evidence: 'VERSION 0-2 appear incomplete/identical (truncated at ''When the fluorescent
    lights hummed their constant tune,...''). VERSION 3 introduces meaningful revision:
    tightened opening prose (em-dashes, fragment sentences), added emotional subtext
    (''Elena felt useful, indispensable, safe''), and expanded narrative arc. FINAL
    OUTPUT fully executes all constraints: (1) Elena''s competence established through
    staffing decisions, precise spreadsheets, nurse trust, and code blue observation
    before revealing her flaw of emotional isolation/over-reliance on work identity;
    (2) Friendship with Marta feels earned through specific moments (broth offerings,
    shared silence, gradual vulnerability) rather than convenient; (3) Transformation
    is internal—Elena''s external actions remain minimal (she sits, accepts broth,
    doesn''t send messages), but her internal relationship to work/safety shifts;
    (4) Medical detail (oxygen saturations 88→94 percent) serves narrative by grounding
    the code blue moment and establishing Elena''s competence in real terms; (5) Ending
    achieves ambiguity—''wondering if she had changed at all, or if she was simply
    learning the shape of a different comfort'' leaves genuine uncertainty about whether
    this is lasting transformation or temporary reprieve. Prose quality improved significantly:
    opening condensed from 4 sentences to 3 tighter ones, emotional beats deepened
    (sting in chest, loneliness echoing), and the final bench scene creates cyclical
    resonance. Minor weakness: the transformation could be slightly more internally
    conflicted—Elena accepts change somewhat readily, though the ambiguous ending
    partially compensates.'
