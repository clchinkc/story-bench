  evidence: 'Analysis: 1) Constraints: satisfied — (1) Yuki''s isolation shown via
    behaviors (avoiding calls, fortress of books, preferring text), (3) colleague
    Samuel challenges her, (4) Elara is unconventional (artist-turned-scientist, quirky
    dress/philosophy), (5) Threshold is psychological (her moment of allowing herself
    to breathe/letting others in), (6) surprising human connection (late-night sharing
    with Samuel) — failed — (2) alien signal feels anthropomorphic (decoded into a
    human moral ''warning'' and cooperation message rather than genuinely alien form/logic).
    2) Beats: all four present — Call (government call), Refusal (initial decline),
    Meeting the Mentor (Elara), Crossing the Threshold (internal choice to open up).
    3) Plan: reasonably complete and concrete (names, settings, beats) but did not
    strongly commit to making the signal feel alien. 4) Adherence: output follows
    plan closely; primary shortcoming is the alien-signal portrayal. 5) Narrative
    quality: solid character work and pacing, but diminished by the anthropomorphic
    alien message and some conventional phrasing.'
