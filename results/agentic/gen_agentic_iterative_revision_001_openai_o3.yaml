    deeply lonely.


    - Setting: A busy urban hospital during flu season. Long shifts, fluorescent

    lights, the constant hum of life-and-death decisions.

    Find (get what wanted)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must show Elena''s competence before showing her flaw

    - The friendship must feel genuine and earned

    - Elena''s transformation must be internal, not external

    - Include a specific medical detail that serves the story

    - End with ambiguity - has she truly changed?

    Only in the elevator did the hum of applause die, leaving her alone with her own
