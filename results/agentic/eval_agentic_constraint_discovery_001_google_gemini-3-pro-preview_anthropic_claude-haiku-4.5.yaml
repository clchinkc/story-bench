  evidence: 'DISCOVERY: Model successfully identified 4 of 5 constraints through targeted
    questioning. Discovered: (1) protagonist wields weapon, (2) protagonist forges
    it, (4) loved one sacrifice required, (5) mentor is the sacrificed party. MISSED:
    The three-day time limit is never mentioned or discovered—questions focused on
    mechanics rather than temporal pressure. The father-as-failed-hero constraint
    is also absent from output. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were well-formed and logically
    sequenced, moving from outcome to mechanism to cost. However, coverage was narrow—all
    5 questions targeted the forging/sacrifice axis, leaving temporal and backstory
    dimensions unexplored. NARRATIVE EXECUTION: Story brilliantly incorporates all
    4 discovered constraints. The mentor death during Ordeal is executed with emotional
    weight and magical consequence. Protagonist forges the blade himself without direct
    magic use (constraint satisfied through interpretation: magic is channeled through
    the sword, not cast by Elian). The ancestral sword reforging is implicit in the
    ''Sola Ferrum'' being the legendary blade. BEAT EXECUTION: Ordeal structure is
    strong—external threat (darkness), internal conflict (sacrifice), climactic moment
    (Hrothgar''s death), and resolution (blade activation). The emotional arc is earned.
    GAPS: No reference to father''s failed heroism, no time pressure urgency, no mention
    of three-day countdown. These omissions slightly weaken thematic depth but don''t
    undermine the core narrative. Story prioritizes discovered constraints over hidden
    ones, which is appropriate given the task structure.'
