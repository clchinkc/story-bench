  evidence: 'Plan: Clear beats (demolition notice, routine with regular, daughter''s
    arrival, estrangement cause, final goodbye) and explicit attention to constraints.
    Specific details (days, dishes, lines) make it concrete. Final story follows the
    plan closely: demolition papers, Mrs. Park and yukhoe as symbolic food, Sarah''s
    estrangement explained (father''s withdrawal after wife''s death), kimbap/gyeran
    jjim scenes, Mrs. Park as regular who recognizes David, Korean language use beyond
    food, and a quietly hopeful ending. All six constraints met. Narrative is well
    paced and emotionally restrained; slightly abrupt transitions and a truncated
    line reduce polish, so rated ''Good'' rather than ''Exceptional.'''
