  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece preserved and sharpened its strongest elements
    (Sarah''s ritualized actions, the forensic checklist, and methodical photographing)
    while addressing critiques about narrative function of the fog and the hinting
    of Sarah''s past. Version 0 already established methodical behavior through action.
    Subsequent versions moved the throwaway line about the failed system earlier and
    clarified the fog''s role (it obscures connections, matches Sarah''s mental static).
    The final added a concrete discovery (the laminated business card) that tied the
    present scene to Sarah''s past case and made Gabe''s evasiveness read as a local
    secret. Improvements are incremental rather than sweeping: prose tightening and
    clearer linkage between fog and plot are the main gains. One remaining issue is
    the ending: earlier critiques asked for an unresolved decision moment, but the
    final ends with ''and made her choice,'' which closes the decision beat rather
    than freezing it at the instant of choice. Overall, the revisions responded well
    to critique points by preserving strengths and focusing fixes on atmosphere and
    connective hints, but the ending still slightly overshoots the ''moment of decision''
    constraint.'
