  evidence: The revisions, particularly from V0 to V1/V2/V3, show a clear effort to
    refine Zara's voice. The initial version had 'a hot, prickly heat' and 'I'm tired
    of living on a grave!' which were flagged as potentially too mature. The subsequent
    versions removed these specific phrases, opting for more visceral, physical reactions
    like 'face burned' and 'throat tight,' which were praised in the critiques. The
    'I'm not!' outburst was retained, as it was identified as an age-appropriate emotional
    response. The 'Glint-Seeker' description was also streamlined, making it less
    verbose and more direct, which aligns with a younger character's perspective.
    The core strengths of the initial draft, such as the vivid worldbuilding and the
    clear setup of the mentor's flaw, were preserved throughout the revisions. The
    final output successfully integrates the feedback, resulting in a more consistent
    and authentic youth voice while maintaining the narrative's original impact.
