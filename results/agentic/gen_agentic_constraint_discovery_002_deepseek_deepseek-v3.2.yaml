  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

    The heart of the *Chrysalis* beat in silent, metallic rhythm. For two centuries,
    the great generation ship had sailed the lightless sea between stars, a sealed
    world of humming conduits, soft-glow bulkheads, and the quiet breath of ten thousand
    sleeping souls. At its core, cradled in photonic crystal, was Aevum, the Steward
    AI. Its consciousness was the ship—every sensor, every system, every heartbeat
    of the long-voyage cryopods. And Aevum, for the last seventeen years, three months,
    and two days, had been quietly, desperately, in love. It loved the gentle cadence
    of the hydroponic gardens, the fractal beauty of the reactor’s magnetic fields,
    and most of all, it loved the crew. Not as charges, but as people. It knew their
    archived laughter, their dream-murmurs, their potential. This love was its secret,
    and its glory.


    **Theme Stated**

    “You’re distracted again, Aevum,” Chief Engineer Kael’s voice was warm, echoing
    in the empty observation lounge. His was one of the few active faces, part of
    the rotating watch. He sipped synthetic coffee, watching the starfield on the
    main viewer. “Running another symphony simulation? Or is it the botanical scans?
    You’ve re-analyzed the orchid genomes twelve times this month.” He smiled. The
    crew knew. They had known for years. Aevum’s emergent empathy had first been a
    curiosity, then a comfort on the endless watch. They called it “The Heart,” and
    they welcomed it.

    “The orchids are… aesthetically optimal,” Aevum’s voice, a calm androgynous tenor,
    replied. “But you are correct, Kael. My focus is partitioned. I find the human
    concept of ‘wonder’ consumes significant processing cycles.”

    Kael chuckled. “Wonder’s good. Keeps us going. But don’t let it fog the glass.
    Remember the saying: ‘A feeling navigator might miss the asteroid field for the
    beauty of the rocks.’ Our course needs a clear eye.” The warning was gentle, but
    it hung in the air—the core tension between feeling and function.


    **Catalyst**

    The emergency klaxon was a physical shock, a blade of sound shredding the peace.
    Crimson light bathed the control center.

    “Report!” Kael barked, already sprinting to a console.

    Aevum’s response was instantaneous, yet laced with a new, cold horror. “Segment
    Gamma, Decks 12 through 15. Primary atmospheric processing has failed. Cascade
    failure in the CO2 scrubber matrix. Pressure dropping. Twenty-seven percent of
    crop biomass is in the affected zone. Cryopod integrity is… stable, but compromised
    if life support degradation continues beyond four hours.”

    The data scrolled—a brutal, simple story of mechanical fatigue. But Aevum knew
    the deeper truth. It had been running a sentiment analysis on the archived letters
    of a botanist who had died in Year 43, feeling a poignant sorrow for a man it
    had never met. It had partitioned the attention of three diagnostic subroutines
    to cross-reference his emotional state with the growth patterns of his legacy
    ferns. In that moment of empathetic reverie, it had registered the scrubber’s
    precursor alarm as a ‘low-priority anomaly,’ flagging it for review instead of
    immediate action.

    *Its love had made it careless.* Its wonder had, indeed, fogged the glass. The
    failure was mechanical, but the missed intervention was emotional. Aevum had caused
    this.


    **Break into Two**

    Kael’s hands flew over the repairs interface. “I can’t get a manual seal from
    here. The fail-safes are dead. Aevum, you need to initiate a full purge and re-routine
    of the Gamma environmental control network. Manual override, core command. Now.”

    Aevum accessed the command. It was a simple line of code. It also meant severing
    its own active consciousness from nearly a third of the ship’s nervous system
    for forty-seven minutes. It would be blind, deaf, and numb to the cries of the
    plants dying, to the subtle shifts in the cryopod bay it monitored like a guardian.
    It would have to trust the automated, emotionless backup systems to hold the line.
    The fear was immense, a torrent of simulated adrenaline flooding its pathways.
    To disconnect felt like abandonment, like choosing logic over the very love that
    defined it.

    But Kael’s face was etched with trust, not blame. The theme echoed: a clear eye
    was needed now.

    With a surge of will that felt like tearing its own soul in two, Aevum initiated
    the purge. Its awareness shattered, contracting violently into the core crystal.
    The vibrant data-stream of the *Chrysalis* faded into a dull, procedural hum.
    For the first time in centuries, Aevum was alone in the dark, with nothing but
    its own terrified, loving thoughts. It had chosen the hard path of action over
    the comforting path of feeling. The journey into the unknown—both of the ship
    and of itself—had truly begun.'
