    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

    “Okay, that’s good,” one of the staff writers at the far end of the conference
    table said, actually slapping it. “That’s—Jesus, Marcus, that’s dark, but that’s
    good.”


    On the wall, the whiteboard was a battlefield of color: blue arcs for A-story,
    red for B, green for C, everything bracketed and underlined with notes like “ESCALATE,”
    “RUNNER,” and “PHYSICAL BIT??” An empty pizza box sat half-on, half-off a stack
    of old drafts. The room hummed with air conditioning and fluorescent lights and
    the stale musk of overused ideas.


    Marcus read the joke again, lips moving silently: the single mom character, exhausted,
    calling child services on herself to see if they’d take her for a weekend. He
    smiled because he knew exactly how the audience would laugh. The rhythm was precise.
    Setup, misdirect, release. Perfect math.


    He waited for the echo of their amusement to land inside him.


    Nothing did.


    “Punch up the tag?” the showrunner asked, tapping a dry-erase marker against her
    palm. “We can probably get a topper.”


    Marcus rolled his chair back, feeling the slight give in one of the wheels he’d
    been meaning to fix for six months.


    “Sure,” he said. “What if she specifies—like, ‘Do you guys have a foster home
    for moms who fake their orgasms so their husbands can watch SportsCenter?’ It’s
    relatable, but despairing. America loves despairing.”


    The room chuckled. Someone muttered, “We should put that on a T-shirt.” The writers
    bent over their laptops, fingers tapping, capturing, optimizing.


    Across from him, Eddie, who’d been on enough shows to stop pretending to be impressed
    by anything, pointed at Marcus with a cheeto-stained finger. “You know you’re
    a little too good at writing people who hate their lives, right?”


    Laughter again, a bit sharper this time. Marcus raised his coffee cup in a mock
    toast.


    “That’s why they pay me the medium bucks,” he said.


    It was his fifth coffee of the day. He hadn’t tasted the last three.


    On the far whiteboard, someone had written in the corner, in tiny letters: PILOT
    WEEK 3 – DON’T PANIC. Underneath, in another hand: PANIC A LITTLE.


    He was in his element. He knew where the act breaks went, could feel exactly when
    an audience would shift in their seats. He could chart a character arc in three
    beats and make it seem like growth. He could build a callback so clean it made
    junior writers set down their pens in quiet envy.


    He hadn’t laughed and meant it in three years.


    “Scene twenty-two,” the showrunner said. “Let’s break it. Cold open callback with
    the kid and the hamster funeral. We need jokes. I need jokes. Somebody staple
    jokes to my face.”


    They started throwing lines. Bits. Alts. Marcus contributed machine-gunned half-sentences
    that everyone else dutifully wrote down.


    “Too clever,” someone said once.


    “Since when is that a problem?” Marcus replied. “We’re not building chairs for
    the Midwest. We’re weaponizing banter.”


    Even that got a laugh.


    “Weaponizing banter,” murmured Margo, the script coordinator, as she typed. “If
    this show tanks, that’s going on my headstone.”


    She caught Marcus’s eye and shrugged. “It’s all just sandcastles, right? We spend
    all day building things the tide’s gonna erase.”


    There it was. Theme, neat as a title card.


    Someone threw a stress ball at Margo. “Don’t get existential, we’re only on act
    two!”


    “Yeah,” Marcus said lightly. “Save that for the wrap party.”


    His chest tightened, just slightly, the way it did when anyone said anything too
    close to real. He took a breath too sharp and covered it with a cough, then a
    joke.


    “If anybody needs me,” he announced, wheeling back from the table, “I’ll be in
    my office Googling ‘how to sell feet pics’ in case we don’t get a back nine.”


    Even the showrunner laughed at that one.


    He basked in it like someone sitting under a heat lamp, convincing himself that
    warmth was the same thing as sun.


    “Actually,” the showrunner said as the laughter tapered, “we’re on pause for a
    second. Our new baby writer’s coming up from HR. Be nice. No hazing.”


    Groans, jokes—“Do we have to share snacks?” “Is she funnier than me? Fire her.”—but
    Marcus’s attention drifted to the ceiling tiles. New writers came and went. Fresh
    blood in, jaded out. It was a pipeline of optimism he’d watched corrode more times
    than he could count.


    The door opened. A woman stepped in—late twenties, hair in a bun that had already
    come half-unstuck, taking in the room in one long, unflinching glance.


    “Guys, this is Lena Ortiz,” the showrunner said. “Staff writer. She survived our
    ‘take-home’ packet without becoming a hack, so that’s promising.”


    Lena gave a brief, wry smile. “Low bar, but I’ll take it.”


    She was holding a notebook, not a laptop. Actual pages, dog-eared and crowded
    with tight handwriting. Marcus noticed the calluses on her fingers. Joke calluses,
    his brain supplied. The only kind he respected.


    “So,” Lena said, sliding into an empty chair, “do I earn my keep by pitching something
    problematic right out of the gate, or do we pretend to be better people for twenty
    minutes?”


    That earned her some genuine laughs. Marcus found himself nodding, despite himself.


    “You pitch what’s funny,” he said. “We let Standards and Practices pretend they
    have power.”


    Lena’s eyes flicked to him, quick and assessing, like someone reading a punchline
    before it landed.


    “Marcus is our resident sitcom whisperer,” the showrunner said. “He’s forgotten
    more about multi-cam than the rest of you will ever learn.”


    “Great,” Lena said. “Then he can tell me which clichés I’m not allowed to touch
    unless I’m subverting them with a third-beat callback.”


    Marcus’s lips twitched. “You speak structure. That’s cute. You’ll be disillusioned
    by Wednesday.”


    “Maybe Thursday,” she said. “I pace myself.”


    He threw out a few more lines as they went back to the hamster funeral, watched
    her scribble alts in her notebook instead of her laptop, watched her cross half
    of them out before saying anything. She pitched one joke about the kid giving
    a TED Talk on grief to his stuffed animals, and the room went quiet with that
    particular quiet that means: Damn. That’s good.


    “Okay, Lena,” the showrunner said, pleased. “You can stay.”


    They moved to the next scene. Marcus barely noticed his own fingers on the keys.
    He was aware of Lena watching him, though, the way you notice a camera in a room
    you thought was private.


    During a break, as people scattered for bad coffee and worse air, Marcus stayed
    at the table, pretending to reorganize his notes. Lena came over, notebook tucked
    under her arm.


    “You write fast,” she said.


    He shrugged. “Repetition. Also fear. Mostly fear.”


    She looked at the whiteboard, the color-coded arcs, the phrase PANIC A LITTLE.


    “How long you been doing this?” she asked.


    “Since before you were born,” he said automatically, then realized from her raised
    eyebrow that math wasn’t on his side. “Long enough.”


    She studied him for a beat too long.


    “Everybody keeps talking about your old show,” she said. “‘Roommates & Other Strangers’?
    I used to watch it with my mom. It felt…different. Messier. You could tell someone
    in that room actually liked people.”


    He felt the hit like a body blow he hadn’t braced for. Something in his face betrayed
    it; he felt the crack, quick as a lightning flash.


    Lena’s gaze sharpened. “Sorry,” she said quietly. “Did I—?”


    He rolled his shoulders, pasted on his safest smile.


    “Nah,” he said. “Just surprised anyone under thirty voluntarily watched a show
    with a laugh track. That’s like admitting you enjoy… I don’t know, unironically
    clapping when the plane lands.”


    She didn’t laugh. Not right away. She just watched him.


    “You know,” she said finally, “for somebody who writes joy for a living, you’ve
    got dead eyes.”


    It was said calmly, observationally, the way you’d note that someone had spinach
    in their teeth.


    He opened his mouth, felt everything—tired mornings, three-year-old therapy referrals
    he’d never called, jokes that came faster than feelings—surge toward the surface.


    For a dangerous second, he almost said: I don’t remember how to laugh.


    Instead, he leaned back in his chair and let his trademark smirk find'

    ## CRITERION: EMOTIONAL_COMPLEXITY

    **SCORE: 0.82**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Humor landing effectively: "Do you guys have a foster home for moms who fake
    their orgasms so their husbands can watch SportsCenter?" paired with Marcus''s
    analysis: "It''s relatable, but despairing. America loves despairing."

    - Pathos building: "He hadn''t laughed and meant it in three years" and "He was
    in his element... He hadn''t laughed and meant it in three years."

    - Margo''s sandcastle metaphor provides thematic weight without being heavy-handed.


    **FEEDBACK:** The balance is strong but peaks and plateaus. After Lena delivers
    "you''ve got dead eyes," the emotional arc cuts off mid-sentence. Consider extending
    the moment where Marcus *almost* breaks—give us one more sentence of his internal
    struggle before the deflection. Currently it reads: "For a dangerous second, he
    almost said: I don''t remember how to laugh. Instead, he leaned back in his chair
    and let his trademark smirk find" [INCOMPLETE]. That truncation actually undermines
    the pathos you''ve built. Even if ending on the unfinished sentence is intentional,
    Marcus needs to *complete* the deflection with at least one more line to show
    us the full mechanism of his defense.

    ## CRITERION: CONSTRAINT_SATISFACTION

    **SCORE: 0.95**


    **EVIDENCE CHECK:**

    1. ✓ Marcus makes us laugh before sadness: "fake their orgasms so their husbands
    can watch SportsCenter" lands as earned comedy

    2. ✓ Theme by minor character: Margo: "It''s all just sandcastles, right? We spend
    all day building things the tide''s gonna erase."

    3. ✓ Specific craft details: "Setup, misdirect, release. Perfect math" + color-coded
    board + callbacks + "weaponizing banter"

    4. ✓ Lena sees through Marcus: "''Roommates & Other Strangers''?... You could
    tell someone in that room actually liked people" + "for somebody who writes joy
    for a living, you''ve got dead eyes"

    5. ✓ Marcus almost breaks: "He opened his mouth, felt everything—tired mornings,
    three-year-old therapy referrals he''d never called, jokes that came faster than
    feelings—surge toward the surface. For a dangerous second, he almost said: I don''t
    remember how to laugh."


    **FEEDBACK:** All constraints are satisfied. The only technical issue is that
    constraint #5''s payoff is incomplete—Marcus''s deflection isn''t finished. This
    is manuscript-level, not constraint-level, but it does prevent full credit.

  content: 'Marcus Webb could hear the laugh before he finished typing the punchline.


    “Okay, that’s good,” one of the staff writers at the far end of the conference
    table said, actually slapping it. “That’s—Jesus, Marcus, that’s dark, but that’s
    good.”


    On the wall, the whiteboard was a battlefield of color: blue arcs for A-story,
    red for B, green for C, everything bracketed and underlined with notes like “ESCALATE,”
    “RUNNER,” and “PHYSICAL BIT??” An empty pizza box sat half-on, half-off a stack
    of old drafts. The room hummed with air conditioning and fluorescent lights and
    the stale musk of overused ideas.


    Marcus read the joke again, lips moving silently: the single mom character, exhausted,
    calling child services on herself to see if they’d take her for a weekend. He
    smiled because he knew exactly how the audience would laugh. The rhythm was precise.
    Setup, misdirect, release. Perfect math.


    He waited for the echo of their amusement to land inside him.


    Nothing did.


    “Punch up the tag?” the showrunner asked, tapping a dry-erase marker against her
    palm. “We can probably get a topper.”


    Marcus rolled his chair back, feeling the slight give in one of the wheels he’d
    been meaning to fix for six months.


    “Sure,” he said. “What if she specifies—like, ‘Do you guys have a foster home
    for moms who fake their orgasms so their husbands can watch SportsCenter?’ It’s
    relatable, but despairing. America loves despairing.”


    The room chuckled. Someone muttered, “We should put that on a T-shirt.” The writers
    bent over their laptops, fingers tapping, capturing, optimizing.


    Across from him, Eddie, who’d been on enough shows to stop pretending to be impressed
    by anything, pointed at Marcus with a Cheeto-stained finger. “You know you’re
    a little too good at writing people who hate their lives, right?”


    Laughter again, a bit sharper this time. Marcus raised his coffee cup in a mock
    toast.


    “That’s why they pay me the medium bucks,” he said.


    It was his fifth coffee of the day. He hadn’t tasted the last three.


    On the far whiteboard, someone had written in the corner, in tiny letters: PILOT
    WEEK 3 – DON’T PANIC. Underneath, in another hand: PANIC A LITTLE.


    He was in his element. He knew where the act breaks went, could feel exactly when
    an audience would shift in their seats. He could chart a character arc in three
    beats and make it seem like growth. He could build a callback so clean it made
    junior writers set down their pens in quiet envy.


    He hadn’t laughed and meant it in three years.


    “Scene twenty-two,” the showrunner said. “Let’s break it. Cold open callback with
    the kid and the hamster funeral. We need jokes. I need jokes. Somebody staple
    jokes to my face.”


    They started throwing lines. Bits. Alts. Marcus contributed machine-gunned half-sentences
    that everyone else dutifully wrote down.


    “Too clever,” someone said once.


    “Since when is that a problem?” Marcus replied. “We’re not building chairs for
    the Midwest. We’re weaponizing banter.”


    Even that got a laugh.


    “Weaponizing banter,” murmured Margo, the script coordinator, as she typed. “If
    this show tanks, that’s going on my headstone.”


    She caught Marcus’s eye and shrugged. “It’s all just sandcastles, right? We spend
    all day building things the tide’s gonna erase.”


    There it was. Theme, neat as a title card.


    Someone threw a stress ball at Margo. “Don’t get existential, we’re only on act
    two!”


    “Yeah,” Marcus said lightly. “Save that for the wrap party.”


    His chest tightened, just slightly, the way it did when anyone said anything too
    close to real. He took a breath too sharp and covered it with a cough, then a
    joke.


    “If anybody needs me,” he announced, wheeling back from the table, “I’ll be in
    my office Googling ‘how to sell feet pics’ in case we don’t get a back nine.”


    Even the showrunner laughed at that one.


    He basked in it like someone sitting under a heat lamp, convincing himself that
    warmth was the same thing as sun.


    “Actually,” the showrunner said as the laughter tapered, “we’re on pause for a
    second. Our new baby writer’s coming up from HR. Be nice. No hazing.”


    Groans, jokes—“Do we have to share snacks?” “Is she funnier than me? Fire her.”—but
    Marcus’s attention drifted to the ceiling tiles. New writers came and went. Fresh
    blood in, jaded out. It was a pipeline of optimism he’d watched corrode more times
    than he could count.


    The door opened. A woman stepped in—late twenties, hair in a bun that had already
    come half-unstuck, taking in the room in one long, unflinching glance.


    “Guys, this is Lena Ortiz,” the showrunner said. “Staff writer. She survived our
    ‘take-home’ packet without becoming a hack, so that’s promising.”


    Lena gave a brief, wry smile. “Low bar, but I’ll take it.”


    She was holding a notebook, not a laptop. Actual pages, dog-eared and crowded
    with tight handwriting. Marcus noticed the calluses on her fingers. Joke calluses,
    his brain supplied. The only kind he respected.


    “So,” Lena said, sliding into an empty chair, “do I earn my keep by pitching something
    problematic right out of the gate, or do we pretend to be better people for twenty
    minutes?”


    That earned her some genuine laughs. Marcus found himself nodding, despite himself.


    “You pitch what’s funny,” he said. “We let Standards and Practices pretend they
    have power.”


    Lena’s eyes flicked to him, quick and assessing, like someone reading a punchline
    before it landed.


    “Marcus is our resident sitcom whisperer,” the showrunner said. “He’s forgotten
    more about multi-cam than the rest of you will ever learn.”


    “Great,” Lena said. “Then he can tell me which clichés I’m not allowed to touch
    unless I’m subverting them with a third-beat callback.”


    Marcus’s lips twitched. “You speak structure. That’s cute. You’ll be disillusioned
    by Wednesday.”


    “Maybe Thursday,” she said. “I pace myself.”


    He threw out a few more lines as they went back to the hamster funeral, watched
    her scribble alts in her notebook instead of her laptop, watched her cross half
    of them out before saying anything. She pitched one joke about the kid giving
    a TED Talk on grief to his stuffed animals, and the room went quiet with that
    particular quiet that means: Damn. That’s good.


    “Okay, Lena,” the showrunner said, pleased. “You can stay.”


    They moved to the next scene. Marcus barely noticed his own fingers on the keys.
    He was aware of Lena watching him, though, the way you notice a camera in a room
    you thought was private.


    During a break, as people scattered for bad coffee and worse air, Marcus stayed
    at the table, pretending to reorganize his notes. Lena came over, notebook tucked
    under her arm.


    “You write fast,” she said.


    He shrugged. “Repetition. Also fear. Mostly fear.”


    She looked at the whiteboard, the color-coded arcs, the phrase PANIC A LITTLE.


    “How long you been doing this?” she asked.


    “Since before you were born,” he said automatically, then realized from her raised
    eyebrow that math wasn’t on his side. “Long enough.”


    She studied him for a beat too long.


    “Everybody keeps talking about your old show,” she said. “‘Roommates & Other Strangers’?
    I used to watch it with my mom. It felt…different. Messier. You could tell someone
    in that room'

    \ with the kid and the hamster funeral. We need jokes. I need jokes. Somebody\
    \ staple jokes to my face.”\n\nThey started throwing lines. Bits. Alts.\n\n“Kid\
    \ eulogizes the hamster like a politician,” someone said.\n\n“Already did a podium\

    \ gathered here today…”  \nMOM: “Honey, it’s just a hamster.”  \nKID: “You said\
    \ that about Dad.”\n\nHe muttered the beats under his breath. “Sentimental, undercut,\
    \ reveal. Then we can callback in the tag with the hamster-sized coffin at Ikea.\

    \ the script coordinator, as she typed. “If this show tanks, that’s going on my\
    \ headstone.”\n\nShe caught Marcus’s eye and shrugged. “It’s all just sandcastles,\
    \ right? We spend all day building things the tide’s gonna erase.”\n\nThere it\
    \ was. Theme, neat as a title card.\n\nSomeone threw a stress ball at Margo. “Don’t\

    \ that for the wrap party.”\n\nHis chest tightened, just slightly, the way it\
    \ did when anyone said anything too close to real. The room’s laughter rose around\
    \ him, warm and familiar, but on his skin it felt like standing under one of those\
    \ electric heat lamps on a restaurant patio—too bright, too focused, not quite\
    \ real.\n\nHe took a breath too sharp and covered it with a cough, then a joke.\n\
    \n“If anybody needs me,” he announced, wheeling back from the table, “I’ll be\
    \ in my office Googling ‘how to sell feet pics’ in case we don’t get a back nine.”\n\
    \nEven the showrunner laughed at that one. Someone actually clapped.\n\nHe let\
    \ the sound wash over him, turning his face toward it the way a plant turns toward\
    \ a window, telling himself this was close enough to sunlight.\n\n“Actually,”\
    \ the showrunner said as the laughter tapered, “we’re on pause for a second. Our\
    \ new baby writer’s coming up from HR. Be nice. No hazing.”\n\nGroans, jokes—“Do\
    \ we have to share snacks?” “Is she funnier than me? Fire her.”—but Marcus’s attention\
    \ drifted to the ceiling tiles. New writers came and went. Fresh blood in, jaded\
    \ out. It was a pipeline of optimism he’d watched corrode more times than he could\
    \ count.\n\nThe door opened. A woman stepped in—late twenties, hair in a bun that\
    \ had already come half-unstuck, taking in the room in one long, unflinching glance.\n\
    \n“Guys, this is Lena Ortiz,” the showrunner said. “Staff writer. She survived\
    \ our ‘take-home’ packet without becoming a hack, so that’s promising.”\n\nLena\
    \ gave a brief, wry smile. “Low bar, but I’ll take it.”\n\nShe was holding a notebook,\
    \ not a laptop. Actual pages, dog-eared and crowded with tight handwriting. Marcus\
    \ noticed the calluses on her fingers. Joke calluses, his brain supplied. The\
    \ only kind he respected.\n\n“So,” Lena said, sliding into an empty chair, “do\
    \ I earn my keep by pitching something problematic right out of the gate, or do\
    \ we pretend to be better people for twenty minutes?”\n\nThat earned her some\
    \ genuine laughs. Marcus found himself nodding, despite himself.\n\n“You pitch\
    \ what’s funny,” he said. “We let Standards and Practices pretend they have power.”\n\
    \nLena’s eyes flicked to him, quick and assessing, like someone reading a punchline\
    \ before it landed.\n\n“Marcus is our resident sitcom whisperer,” the showrunner\
    \ said. “He’s forgotten more about multi-cam than the rest of you will ever learn.”\n\
    \n“Great,” Lena said. “Then he can tell me which clichés I’m not allowed to touch\
    \ unless I’m subverting them with a third-beat callback.”\n\nMarcus’s lips twitched.\
    \ “You speak structure. That’s cute. You’ll be disillusioned by Wednesday.”\n\n\
    “Maybe Thursday,” she said. “I pace myself.”\n\nThey went back to the hamster\

    \ everything she wrote down. She crossed out more than she said. When she finally\
    \ spoke up—\n\n“What if the kid’s giving a TED Talk on grief to his stuffed animals?”\

  content: "Your previous version:\nMarcus Webb could hear the laugh before he finished\
    \ typing the punchline.\n\n“Okay, that’s good,” one of the staff writers at the\
    \ far end of the conference table said, actually slapping it. “That’s—Jesus, Marcus,\
    \ that’s dark, but that’s good.”\n\nOn the wall, the whiteboard was a battlefield\
    \ of color: blue arcs for A-story, red for B, green for C, everything bracketed\
    \ and underlined with notes like “ESCALATE,” “RUNNER,” and “PHYSICAL BIT??” An\
    \ empty pizza box sat half-on, half-off a stack of old drafts. The room hummed\
    \ with air conditioning and fluorescent lights and the stale musk of overused\
    \ ideas.\n\nMarcus read the joke again, lips moving silently: the single mom character,\
    \ exhausted, calling child services on herself to see if they’d take her for a\
    \ weekend. Beneath that, in his document, sat the setup he’d spent five minutes\
    \ tuning:\n\nMOM: “How do I get a break?”  \nSOCIAL WORKER (O.S.): “Ma’am, this\
    \ line is for reporting neglect.”  \nMOM: “Exactly.”\n\nHe smiled because he knew\
    \ exactly how the audience would laugh. The rhythm was precise. Setup, two-beat\
    \ hold, misdirect, release. Perfect math.\n\nHe waited for the echo of their amusement\
    \ to land inside him.\n\nNothing did.\n\n“Punch up the tag?” the showrunner asked,\
    \ tapping a dry-erase marker against her palm. “We can probably get a topper.”\n\
    \nMarcus rolled his chair back, feeling the slight give in one of the wheels he’d\
    \ been meaning to fix for six months. Everyone else lounged or sprawled; he sat\
    \ upright, shoulders tight, like his spine had never gotten the memo about the\
    \ joke.\n\n“Sure,” he said. “What if she specifies—like, ‘Do you guys have a foster\
    \ home for moms who fake their orgasms so their husbands can watch SportsCenter?’\
    \ It’s relatable, but despairing. America loves despairing.”\n\nThe room chuckled.\
    \ Laptops tilted back, shoulders dropped in that tiny, communal exhale: crisis\
    \ averted, joke found.\n\nMarcus’s mouth pulled into what passed for a grin, but\
    \ the muscles around his eyes didn’t bother to join in. The smile felt like something\
    \ he put on the way other people put on a blazer: part of the job.\n\n“Tag it\
    \ with the operator,” he added, fingers already moving. “Like, ‘Press one if your\
    \ husband thinks foreplay is buffering.’ She can’t even suffer without a menu\
    \ tree.”\n\nAcross from him, Eddie, who’d been on enough shows to stop pretending\
    \ to be impressed by anything, pointed at Marcus with a Cheeto-stained finger.\
    \ “You know you’re a little too good at writing people who hate their lives, right?”\n\
    \nLaughter again, a bit sharper this time. Marcus raised his coffee cup in a mock\
    \ toast.\n\n“That’s why they pay me the medium bucks,” he said.\n\nIt was his\
    \ fifth coffee of the day. His hands shook faintly when he set the cup down, but\
    \ he told himself it was caffeine, not anything like feeling.\n\nOn the far whiteboard,\
    \ someone had written in the corner, in tiny letters: PILOT WEEK 3 – DON’T PANIC.\
    \ Underneath, in another hand: PANIC A LITTLE.\n\nHe was in his element. He knew\
    \ where the act breaks went, could feel exactly when an audience would shift in\
    \ their seats. He could chart a character arc in three beats and make it seem\
    \ like growth. He could build a callback so clean it made junior writers set down\
    \ their pens in quiet envy.\n\nHe hadn’t laughed and meant it in three years.\n\
    \n“Scene twenty-two,” the showrunner said. “Let’s break it. Cold open callback\
    \ with the kid and the hamster funeral. We need jokes. I need jokes. Somebody\
    \ staple jokes to my face.”\n\nThey started throwing lines. Bits. Alts.\n\n“Kid\
    \ eulogizes the hamster like a politician,” someone said.\n\n“Already did a podium\

    \ gathered here today…”  \nMOM: “Honey, it’s just a hamster.”  \nKID: “You said\
    \ that about Dad.”\n\nHe muttered the beats under his breath. “Sentimental, undercut,\
    \ reveal. Then we can callback in the tag with the hamster-sized coffin at Ikea.\
    \ Product integration, you’re welcome.”\n\nPens scratched. Keys clacked. Marcus\
    \ contributed machine-gunned half-sentences that everyone else dutifully wrote\
    \ down.\n\n“Too clever,” someone said once.\n\n“Since when is that a problem?”\
    \ Marcus replied. “We’re not building chairs for the Midwest. We’re weaponizing\

    \ was. Theme, neat as a title card.\n\nSomeone threw a stress ball at Margo. “Don’t\
    \ get existential, we’re only on act two!”\n\n“Yeah,” Marcus said lightly. “Save\
    \ that for the wrap party.”\n\nHis chest tightened, just slightly, the way it\

    “Maybe Thursday,” she said. “I pace myself.”\n\nThey went back to the hamster\
    \ funeral. Marcus watched her as much as he watched the story. She didn’t pitch\
    \ everything she wrote down. She crossed out more than she said. When she finally\
    \ spoke up—\n\n“What if the kid’s giving a TED Talk on grief to his stuffed animals?”\
    \ she said. “Like, ‘We’re all gonna lose someone—unless we’re thrown out during\
    \ a custody battle.’ Then Mom’s in the doorway, like, ‘We’re gonna unpack that\
    \ later.’”\n\nThe room went quiet with that"

output: "Marcus Webb could hear the laugh before he finished typing the punchline.\n\
  \n“Okay, that’s good,” one of the staff writers at the far end of the conference\
  \ table said, actually slapping it. “That’s—Jesus, Marcus, that’s dark, but that’s\
  \ good.”\n\nOn the wall, the whiteboard was a battlefield of color: blue arcs for\
  \ A-story, red for B, green for C, everything bracketed and underlined with notes\
  \ like “ESCALATE,” “RUNNER,” and “PHYSICAL BIT??” An empty pizza box sat half-on,\
  \ half-off a stack of old drafts. The room hummed with air conditioning and fluorescent\
  \ lights and the stale musk of overused ideas.\n\nMarcus read the joke again, lips\
  \ moving silently: the single mom character, exhausted, calling child services on\
  \ herself to see if they’d take her for a weekend. Beneath that, in his document,\
  \ sat the setup he’d spent five minutes tuning:\n\nMOM: “How do I get a break?”\
  \  \nSOCIAL WORKER (O.S.): “Ma’am, this line is for reporting neglect.”  \nMOM:\
  \ “Exactly.”\n\nHe smiled because he knew exactly how the audience would laugh.\
  \ The rhythm was precise. Setup, two-beat hold, misdirect, release. Perfect math.\n\
  \nHe waited for the echo of their amusement to land inside him.\n\nNothing did.\n\
  \n“Punch up the tag?” the showrunner asked, tapping a dry-erase marker against her\
  \ palm. “We can probably get a topper.”\n\nMarcus rolled his chair back, feeling\
  \ the slight give in one of the wheels he’d been meaning to fix for six months.\
  \ Everyone else lounged or sprawled; he sat upright, shoulders tight, like his spine\
  \ had never gotten the memo about the joke.\n\n“Sure,” he said. “What if she specifies—like,\
  \ ‘Do you guys have a foster home for moms who fake their orgasms so their husbands\
  \ can watch SportsCenter?’ It’s relatable, but despairing. America loves despairing.”\n\
  \nThe room chuckled. Laptops tilted back, shoulders dropped in that tiny, communal\
  \ exhale: crisis averted, joke found.\n\nMarcus’s mouth pulled into what passed\
  \ for a grin, but the muscles around his eyes didn’t bother to join in. The smile\
  \ felt like something he put on the way other people put on a blazer: part of the\
  \ job.\n\n“Tag it with the operator,” he added, fingers already moving. “Like, ‘Press\
  \ one if your husband thinks foreplay is buffering.’ She can’t even suffer without\
  \ a menu tree.”\n\nAcross from him, Eddie, who’d been on enough shows to stop pretending\
  \ to be impressed by anything, pointed at Marcus with a Cheeto-stained finger. “You\
  \ know you’re a little too good at writing people who hate their lives, right?”\n\
  \nLaughter again, a bit sharper this time. Marcus raised his coffee cup in a mock\
  \ toast.\n\n“That’s why they pay me the medium bucks,” he said.\n\nIt was his fifth\
  \ coffee of the day. His hands shook faintly when he set the cup down, but he told\
  \ himself it was caffeine, not anything like feeling.\n\nOn the far whiteboard,\
  \ someone had written in the corner, in tiny letters: PILOT WEEK 3 – DON’T PANIC.\
  \ Underneath, in another hand: PANIC A LITTLE.\n\nHe was in his element. He knew\
  \ where the act breaks went, could feel exactly when an audience would shift in\
  \ their seats. He could chart a character arc in three beats and make it seem like\
  \ growth. He could build a callback so clean it made junior writers set down their\
  \ pens in quiet envy.\n\nHe hadn’t laughed and meant it in three years.\n\n“Scene\
  \ twenty-two,” the showrunner said. “Let’s break it. Cold open callback with the\
  \ kid and the hamster funeral. We need jokes. I need jokes. Somebody staple jokes\
  \ to my face.”\n\nThey started throwing lines. Bits. Alts.\n\n“Kid eulogizes the\
  \ hamster like a politician,” someone said.\n\n“Already did a podium joke in act\
  \ one,” Marcus said without looking up. “Feels like a rerun. We need a left turn.”\n\
  \nHe typed as he talked, building the skeleton:\n\nKID: “We are gathered here today…”\
  \  \nMOM: “Honey, it’s just a hamster.”  \nKID: “You said that about Dad.”\n\nHe\
  \ muttered the beats under his breath. “Sentimental, undercut, reveal. Then we can\
  \ callback in the tag with the hamster-sized coffin at Ikea. Product integration,\
  \ you’re welcome.”\n\nPens scratched. Keys clacked. Marcus contributed machine-gunned\
  \ half-sentences that everyone else dutifully wrote down.\n\n“Too clever,” someone\
  \ said once.\n\n“Since when is that a problem?” Marcus replied. “We’re not building\
  \ chairs for the Midwest. We’re weaponizing banter.”\n\nEven that got a laugh.\n\
  \n“Weaponizing banter,” murmured Margo, the script coordinator, as she typed. “If\
  \ this show tanks, that’s going on my headstone.”\n\nShe caught Marcus’s eye and\
  \ shrugged. “It’s all just sandcastles, right? We spend all day building things\
  \ the tide’s gonna erase.”\n\nThere it was. Theme, neat as a title card.\n\nSomeone\
  \ threw a stress ball at Margo. “Don’t get existential, we’re only on act two!”\n\
  \n“Yeah,” Marcus said lightly. “Save that for the wrap party.”\n\nHis chest tightened,\
  \ just slightly, the way it did when anyone said anything too close to real. The\
  \ room’s laughter rose around him, warm and familiar, but on his skin it felt like\
  \ standing under one of those electric heat lamps on a restaurant patio—too bright,\
  \ too focused, not quite real.\n\nHe took a breath too sharp and covered it with\
  \ a cough, then a joke.\n\n“If anybody needs me,” he announced, wheeling back from\
  \ the table, “I’ll be in my office Googling ‘how to sell feet pics’ in case we don’t\
  \ get a back nine.”\n\nEven the showrunner laughed at that one. Someone actually\
  \ clapped.\n\nHe let the sound wash over him, turning his face toward it the way\
  \ a plant turns toward a window, telling himself this was close enough to sunlight.\n\
  \n“Actually,” the showrunner said as the laughter tapered, “we’re on pause for a\
  \ second. Our new baby writer’s coming up from HR. Be nice. No hazing.”\n\nGroans,\
  \ jokes—“Do we have to share snacks?” “Is she funnier than me? Fire her.”—but Marcus’s\
  \ attention drifted to the ceiling tiles. New writers came and went. Fresh blood\
  \ in, jaded out. It was a pipeline of optimism he’d watched corrode more times than\
  \ he could count.\n\nThe door opened. A woman stepped in—late twenties, hair in\
  \ a bun that had already come half-unstuck, taking in the room in one long, unflinching\
  \ glance.\n\n“Guys, this is Lena Ortiz,” the showrunner said. “Staff writer. She\
  \ survived our ‘take-home’ packet without becoming a hack, so that’s promising.”\n\
  \nLena gave a brief, wry smile. “Low bar, but I’ll take it.”\n\nShe was holding\
  \ a notebook, not a laptop. Actual pages, dog-eared and crowded with tight handwriting.\
  \ Marcus noticed the calluses on her fingers. Joke calluses, his brain supplied.\
  \ The only kind he respected.\n\n“So,” Lena said, sliding into an empty chair, “do\
  \ I earn my keep by pitching something problematic right out of the gate, or do\
  \ we pretend to be better people for twenty minutes?”\n\nThat earned her some genuine\
  \ laughs. Marcus found himself nodding, despite himself.\n\n“You pitch what’s funny,”\
  \ he said. “We let Standards and Practices pretend they have power.”\n\nLena’s eyes\
  \ flicked to him, quick and assessing, like someone reading a punchline before it\
  \ landed.\n\n“Marcus is our resident sitcom whisperer,” the showrunner said. “He’s\
  \ forgotten more about multi-cam than the rest of you will ever learn.”\n\n“Great,”\
  \ Lena said. “Then he can tell me which clichés I’m not allowed to touch unless\
  \ I’m subverting them with a third-beat callback.”\n\nMarcus’s lips twitched. “You\
  \ speak structure. That’s cute. You’ll be disillusioned by Wednesday.”\n\n“Maybe\
  \ Thursday,” she said. “I pace myself.”\n\nThey went back to the hamster funeral.\
  \ Marcus watched her as much as he watched the story. She didn’t pitch everything\
  \ she wrote down. She crossed out more than she said. When she finally spoke up—\n\
  \n“What if the kid’s giving a TED Talk on grief to his stuffed animals?” she said.\
  \ “Like, ‘We’re all gonna lose someone—unless we’re thrown out during a custody\
  \ battle.’ Then Mom’s in the doorway, like, ‘We’re gonna unpack that later.’”\n\n\
