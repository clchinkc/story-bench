    STORY THEORY: Story Circle


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker
    who has

    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for

    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.


    - Central conflict: When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will
    take 6 months,

    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting

    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.


    - Tone: Quietly profound, observant, gently humorous


    REQUIRED BEATS: You (comfort zone), Need (want something), Go (unfamiliar situation),
    Search (adapt to it)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Teddy''s routine must be shown with specific, loving detail

    - The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been avoiding

    - Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s

    - Teddy''s late wife must be present through absence

    - The new path must offer something the old path couldn''t


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - character_interiority: Is Teddy''s inner life rich and specific?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Story Circle beats properly executed?

    - subtlety: Are emotions conveyed through action and detail, not exposition?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and resonance


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: "The soles of Teddy’s SAS walking shoes were worn thin in a pattern that\
    \ mirrored the topography of the three-mile loop he’d walked since 1984. Every\
    \ morning at 6:05 AM, Teddy stepped off his porch, his joints popping in a familiar\
    \ percussion. He knew the exact moment the Miller’s golden retriever would huff\
    \ under the gate, and the precise angle required to avoid the uneven slab of concrete\
    \ near the old bakery that liked to trip the unwary.\n\nThis routine was a sturdy\
    \ vessel. Inside it, Teddy was safe. Outside of it, the world was too loud, too\
    \ fast, and smelled too much like the lavender detergent Martha used to buy. Since\
    \ Martha’s funeral three years ago, the route was no longer just exercise; it\
    \ was a ritual of preservation. If he kept his eyes on the familiar cracks, he\
    \ didn't have to look at the \"For Sale\" signs or the empty space on the porch\
    \ swing beside him.\n\nOn Tuesday, the vessel cracked. \n\nAt the corner of Trumbull\

    \ the Miller’s dog and the bakery’s brickwork, the morning felt unanchored. He\
    \ looked back toward his house, the urge to retreat almost overwhelming. But the\
    \ thought of the silent kitchen, where the ghost of Martha’s humming still vibrated\
    \ in the floorboards, pushed him forward.\n\nHe turned into the alley behind the\
    \ 4th Street row houses. \n\nIt was a narrow, gravel-choked vein of the neighborhood\
    \ he hadn't seen in decades. He moved slowly, his eyes darting. Here, the gentrification\
    \ hadn't quite reached. It smelled of damp earth and woodsmoke. \n\nNear the midpoint\
    \ of the block, he saw her. A young woman, barely twenty, was hunched over a patch\
    \ of dirt behind a crumbling Victorian. She was surrounded by plastic starter\
    \ pots. \n\n\"You're late,\" she said, not looking up.\n\nTeddy paused, adjusting\
    \ his cap. \"I don't believe we’ve met, miss.\"\n\n\"I see you every morning from\
    \ my window,\" she said, finally glancing back. She had dirt on her nose. \"6:20\
    \ on the dot. Today you’re ten minutes behind. I was starting to think the construction\
    \ got you.\"\n\nShe was planting milkweed. Teddy recognized the serrated leaves;\
    \ Martha used to obsess over the Monarchs. \n\n\"I'm Teddy,\" he said, his voice\
    \ raspy. \n\n\"I'm Sarah. I’m trying to build a corridor,\" she explained, gesturing\
    \ to the string of small gardens blooming in the neglected alley. \"The butterflies\
    \ can’t find their way through the new glass buildings. They need the old weeds.\"\
    \n\nTeddy looked at the milkweed. He looked at Sarah’s stained hands. For years,\
    \ he had walked the perimeter of his grief, circling it like a fence. He had been\
    \ so busy memorizing the cracks in the sidewalk that he hadn't noticed the neighborhood\
    \ was trying to breathe again. \n\n\"Martha—my wife—she used to say the same thing,\"\
    \ Teddy murmured. \"She said if you don't give 'em a place to land, they'll just\
    \ keep flying until they drop.\"\n\n\"She was right,\" Sarah said. She held out\
    \ a trowel. \"Want to help? My back is killing me, and I’ve got twenty more to\
    \ get in before the heat hits.\"\n\nTeddy looked at his clean, pressed slacks.\
    \ Then he looked at the raw earth. He thought of the three-mile loop, the rigid\
    \ safety of it, and how it had become a cage. \n\nHe knelt. The soil was cool\
    \ and surprisingly soft. As he dug the first hole, he realized that for the first\

    CRITERION: Character Interiority

    SCORE: 0.72

    EVIDENCE: "This routine was a sturdy vessel. Inside it, Teddy was safe. Outside
    of it, the world was too loud, too fast, and smelled too much like lavender detergent."
    Also: "For years, he had walked the perimeter of his grief, circling it like a
    fence."

    FEEDBACK: The interiority is conceptually strong but relies too heavily on *telling
    us* Teddy''s emotional state through metaphor. When Teddy encounters the construction,
    you write "He felt a sudden, sharp vertigo" — this is exposition of feeling, not
    embodied experience. Show us vertigo through physical breakdown: his hand reaching
    for something to steady himself, his breath shallow, the world tilting. Deeper
    interiority would explore his specific anxieties about deviation more intimately
    — what does it cost him cognitively to avoid a path? Does his mind race? Does
    he argue with himself? The second half gains strength as he kneels in dirt and
    stops *thinking*, but the first half could probe his resistance more specifically.


    ---


    CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction

    SCORE: 0.93

    EVIDENCE: All constraints present: (1) Routine detail: "worn thin in a pattern...since
    1984," 6:05 AM, Miller''s dog, bakery slab; (2) Disruption reveals avoidance of
    grief and the empty swing; (3) Sarah as neighbor; (4) Martha through absence:
    the humming in floorboards, the swing, the milkweed; (5) New path offers connection
    and purpose.

    FEEDBACK: Excellently executed overall. Minor: The constraint about Martha being
    "present through absence" is satisfied, but it could be *layered* more organically.
    Currently, her presence is announced somewhat directly: "where the ghost of Martha''s
    humming still vibrated in the floorboards." Consider letting her presence emerge
    more subtly through Teddy''s sensory triggers—perhaps he catches a scent and reflexively
    resists naming it, or he sees the milkweed and grief ambushes him without explanation.
    This would deepen rather than simplify.


    ---


    CRITERION: Beat Execution

    SCORE: 0.68

    EVIDENCE: YOU beat: solid opening. GO beat: "he turned into the alley behind the
    4th Street row houses." SEARCH beat: meeting Sarah, learning about the corridor.
    NEED beat is the weakness: "He looked at Sarah''s stained hands. For years, he
    had walked the perimeter of his grief..."

    FEEDBACK: The story circle is *present* but the NEED beat is underdeveloped. In
    a strong Story Circle, the character should *want* something before the disruption
    forces them into the unfamiliar. Here, Teddy''s need (connection, purpose, grief
    processing) is discovered *after* the disruption, not articulated before. Consider:
    Does Teddy carry a small, suppressed hunger before Tuesday? A moment where he
    almost reaches for something (a newspaper mentioning neighborhood change, a glimpse
    of someone else''s garden)? This would make the disruption feel like it answers
    a buried desire rather than imposing a new direction. The beat structure would
    then be: Teddy silently wants *something more* → disruption forces exploration
    → he discovers what he wanted was connection.


    ---


    CRITERION: Subtlety

    SCORE: 0.74

    EVIDENCE: Strong moments: "He looked back toward his house, the urge to retreat
    almost overwhelming. But the thought of the silent kitchen...pushed him forward."
    The internal conflict drives action. Ending: "he realized that for the first time
    in three years, he wasn''t thinking about the next step on the map" conveys transformation
    through thought-action rather than declaration.

    FEEDBACK: Mixed execution. Weaknesses: "He felt a sudden, sharp vertigo" explicates
    the emotion rather than showing its physical signature. What does vertigo *feel*
    like in Teddy''s aging body? Dizziness in the knees? A wobble in his vision? Also,
    "This routine was a sturdy vessel" is very *close* to breaking the subtlety rule
    but survives because the metaphor is fresh and earned. However, the next phrase,
    "Inside it, Teddy was safe. Outside of it, the world was too loud, too fast" returns
    to exposition. Try: *show* the safe routine, *show* him flinching from loudness
    through selective detail, then trust the reader to understand safety vs. danger.
    Strengths: The ending—his realization emerges from *action* (kneeling, digging)
    not reflection, which is precisely the right subtlety.


    ---


    CRITERION: Narrative Quality

    SCORE: 0.83

    EVIDENCE: "worn thin in a pattern that mirrored the topography," "gravel-choked
    vein of the neighborhood," "the ghost of Martha''s humming still vibrated in the
    floorboards," "the neighborhood was trying to breathe again."

    FEEDBACK: The prose is evocative and precise. Metaphors are earned (the route
    as a "sturdy vessel" and later a "cage" creates thematic coherence). Sensory details
    are specific (diesel breath, lavender detergent, damp earth and woodsmoke). Pacing
    is controlled. One minor note: The dialogue with Sarah is slightly expository.
    "I''m trying to build a corridor" followed by explanation of why feels a touch
    on-the-nose. What if Sarah''s project were revealed more obliquely—Teddy asks
    what she''s doing, she answers indirectly, he pieces it together? This would maintain
    narrative elegance. Minor redundancy: "He had dirt on her nose" should be "She
    had dirt on her nose." These are small polish notes; the foundation is strong.


    ---


    OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:


    This story successfully executes its premise and satisfies all hard constraints
    with resonant prose and genuine emotional stakes. The primary weaknesses are subtle
    but consequential: Teddy''s interiority too often settles for interesting metaphor
    rather than visceral embodiment, the NEED beat arrives too late in the story circle
    to create proper narrative architecture, and some emotions are *named* when they
    should be *felt*. Strengths significantly outweigh weaknesses—the ending is earned,
    Martha''s absence shapes the narrative believably, and Sarah feels like a real
    person rather than a plot device. With revision focused on deepening pre-disruption
    tension and showing rather than telling emotional states, this could move from
    strong to excellent.'

  content: "The soles of Teddy’s SAS walking shoes were worn into a specific topography,\
    \ the outer heels shaved down from forty years of the same three-mile loop. At\
    \ 6:05 AM, he stepped off his porch, his knees giving their customary morning\
    \ grit-and-click. He knew the rhythm by heart: the rhythmic *thwack* of the morning\
    \ paper hitting the neighbor’s porch, the sour-sweet scent of the trash bins on\
    \ 3rd Street, and the precise moment to sidestep the buckled sidewalk near the\
    \ old bakery.\n\nLately, though, the routine felt less like a comfort and more\
    \ like a levee holding back a rising tide. As he passed the new \"Artisanal Brew\"\
    \ shop, the scent of expensive beans pulled at him. He slowed, his thumb tracing\
    \ the smooth handle of his walking stick. He wondered what \"cold brew\" actually\
    \ tasted like, or if the young man behind the counter would recognize a retired\
    \ postal worker. But the Miller’s golden retriever was already huffing at the\
    \ gate two houses down, and the schedule was a master that brooked no delays.\
    \ He kept his eyes on the pavement, ignoring the persistent, quiet hunger to simply\
    \ stop and speak to a stranger.\n\nOn Tuesday, the levee broke.\n\nAt the corner\
    \ of Trumbull and Bagley, a wall of orange mesh stood guard. A backhoe sat idling,\
    \ its diesel breath thick and oily. The sidewalk was gone, replaced by a raw trench\
    \ of Detroit clay.\n\nTeddy stopped. The world didn't just change; it tilted.\
    \ The familiar horizon of the bakery’s brickwork seemed to recede, and a sharp,\
    \ cold ringing started in his ears. He reached out, his fingers fumbling for a\
    \ fence post that wasn't there, his breath coming in shallow, ragged hitches.\
    \ Without the cracks in the concrete to guide him, the silence of his own house—the\
    \ way he still reflexively checked the passenger seat for Martha’s knitting bag—threatened\
    \ to swallow him whole.\n\n\"Six months, Pops,\" a worker shouted. \"Go through\

    \ vein behind the 4th Street row houses. It was a part of the neighborhood he\
    \ hadn't seen since the 90s. The air here was different—damp earth and woodsmoke.\n\
    \nHalfway down the block, he saw a young woman kneeling in a patch of sun-drenched\
    \ dirt behind a crumbling Victorian. She was surrounded by plastic starter pots.\
    \ \n\n\"You're ten minutes late,\" she said, her back to him.\n\nTeddy blinked,\

  content: "Your previous version:\nThe soles of Teddy’s SAS walking shoes were worn\
    \ into a specific topography, the outer heels shaved down from forty years of\
    \ the same three-mile loop. At 6:05 AM, he stepped off his porch, his knees giving\
    \ their customary morning grit-and-click. He knew the rhythm by heart: the rhythmic\
    \ *thwack* of the morning paper hitting the neighbor’s porch, the sour-sweet scent\
    \ of the trash bins on 3rd Street, and the precise moment to sidestep the buckled\
    \ sidewalk near the old bakery.\n\nLately, though, the routine felt less like\
    \ a comfort and more like a levee holding back a rising tide. As he passed the\
    \ new \"Artisanal Brew\" shop, the scent of expensive beans pulled at him. He\
    \ slowed, his thumb tracing the smooth handle of his walking stick. He wondered\
    \ what \"cold brew\" actually tasted like, or if the young man behind the counter\
    \ would recognize a retired postal worker. But the Miller’s golden retriever was\
    \ already huffing at the gate two houses down, and the schedule was a master that\
    \ brooked no delays. He kept his eyes on the pavement, ignoring the persistent,\
    \ quiet hunger to simply stop and speak to a stranger.\n\nOn Tuesday, the levee\
    \ broke.\n\nAt the corner of Trumbull and Bagley, a wall of orange mesh stood\
    \ guard. A backhoe sat idling, its diesel breath thick and oily. The sidewalk\
    \ was gone, replaced by a raw trench of Detroit clay.\n\nTeddy stopped. The world\
    \ didn't just change; it tilted. The familiar horizon of the bakery’s brickwork\
    \ seemed to recede, and a sharp, cold ringing started in his ears. He reached\
    \ out, his fingers fumbling for a fence post that wasn't there, his breath coming\
    \ in shallow, ragged hitches. Without the cracks in the concrete to guide him,\
    \ the silence of his own house—the way he still reflexively checked the passenger\
    \ seat for Martha’s knitting bag—threatened to swallow him whole.\n\n\"Six months,\
    \ Pops,\" a worker shouted. \"Go through the alley.\"\n\nTeddy hesitated, then\
    \ turned into the narrow, gravel-choked vein behind the 4th Street row houses.\
    \ It was a part of the neighborhood he hadn't seen since the 90s. The air here\
    \ was different—damp earth and woodsmoke.\n\nHalfway down the block, he saw a\
    \ young woman kneeling in a patch of sun-drenched dirt behind a crumbling Victorian.\
    \ She was surrounded by plastic starter pots. \n\n\"You're ten minutes late,\"\
    \ she said, her back to him.\n\nTeddy blinked, adjusting his cap. \"I... I beg\
    \ your pardon?\"\n\nShe turned, a smudge of dark Detroit soil across her cheek.\
    \ \"I see you every morning from my window. 6:20 sharp. I thought maybe you’d\
    \ finally decided to take a day off.\"\n\n\"I don't take days off,\" Teddy said,\
    \ his voice raspy. He looked at the plants. \"Milkweed?\"\n\n\"Good eye.\" She\
    \ wiped her forehead with a muddy sleeve. \"I’m Sarah. I’m trying to link the\
    \ backyards together. The new glass buildings downtown are like a wall to the\
    \ Monarchs. They need a path through the noise.\"\n\nTeddy looked at the serrated\
    \ leaves. Martha used to spend hours in the backyard, her sun hat bobbing as she\
    \ tracked the orange-and-black wings. He hadn't planted a single seed since her\
    \ funeral; he’d been too busy walking in circles, making sure nothing else changed.\n\
    \n\"Martha—my wife—she used to say they were the bravest things on earth,\" Teddy\
    \ murmured. \"Traveling thousands of miles on wings no thicker than paper.\"\n\

    \ 0.72**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- \"Lately, his mind was often elsewhere\" (vague\

    \ the cracks so he wouldn't have to see the neighborhood changing without her\"\
    \ (strong specific avoidance)\n- \"the grief he'd been outrunning caught up\"\
    \ (tells rather than shows)\n\n**FEEDBACK:** Teddy's inner life has moments of\
    \ richness, but peaks and valleys unevenly. The best moment—\"keeping his eyes\
    \ on the cracks so he wouldn't have to see\"—reveals his avoidance strategy through\
    \ action. However, lines like \"the grief he'd been outrunning caught up\" *name*\
    \ the emotion rather than letting us experience it through thought or sensation.\
    \ Strengthen interiority by adding more visceral, specific thoughts when Teddy\
    \ encounters triggers (the coffee shop door, the trembling hand). What exactly\
    \ runs through his mind? Does he imagine conversations with Martha? Does he calculate\
    \ how many more loops he has left? This specificity would deepen connection.\n\
    \n---\n\n**CRITERION: constraint_satisfaction**\n\n**SCORE: 0.90**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\
    - Routine detail: \"The outer heels of Teddy's SAS walking shoes were shaved into\

    - Neighbor: Sarah with clear intersection point (\"You're ten minutes late\")\n\
    - Absence: \"the single plate in the rack,\" \"the grocery lists Martha hadn't\
    \ written in three years,\" the porch swing\n- New path: The alley and Sarah's\
    \ garden project offer connection and living purpose\n\n**FEEDBACK:** All five\
    \ constraints are satisfied. However, *constraint 3* (neighbor's story) is underdeveloped—Sarah\
    \ exists primarily as a catalyst. Consider: Does Sarah have her own loss or reason\
    \ for this project? What does *her* story reveal beyond being Teddy's mirror?\
    \ One detail about her sacrifice or persistence would enrich this intersection\
    \ without needing a subplot.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: beat_execution**\n\n**SCORE:\

    \ ✓ \"He knelt. The soil was cool...no longer counting the minutes\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\
    \ The NEED beat is the weak link. Teddy *wants* human connection (the coffee shop\
    \ moment suggests this), but this desire isn't clearly articulated before the\
    \ disruption. Currently, the story presents: comfort → disruption → meeting neighbor.\
    \ A stronger version would establish his specific want first. Example: Show him\
    \ nearly entering the coffee shop multiple times before pulling back, or demonstrate\
    \ his loneliness more actively. This would make the disruption feel like a response\
    \ to genuine want, not just circumstantial luck. The Search beat is strong—his\
    \ adaptation to planting shows real change.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: subtlety**\n\

  content: "Your previous version:\nThe outer heels of Teddy’s SAS walking shoes were\
    \ shaved into a specific topography, a slanted record of forty years on the same\
    \ three-mile loop. At 6:05 AM, he stepped off his porch, his knees grit-clicking\
    \ their familiar percussion. Two houses down, the morning paper thwacked against\
    \ a door. On 3rd Street, the trash bins exhaled a sour-sweet breath into the damp\
    \ Detroit air. Teddy sidestepped the buckled sidewalk near the old bakery without\
    \ looking down; his feet remembered the hazard even if his mind was elsewhere.\n\
    \nLately, his mind was often elsewhere. As he approached the new \"Artisanal Brew\"\
    \ shop, the scent of roasted beans pulled at him with a physical weight. He stopped,\
    \ his thumb tracing the smooth, sweat-darkened handle of his walking stick. He\
    \ reached for the brass handle of the shop’s door, eager for the rush of air conditioning\
    \ and the sound of a human voice, but the sudden image of his own kitchen—the\
    \ single plate in the rack, the silence—made his hand tremble. He pulled back,\
    \ adjusting his cap and forcing his eyes down to the safety of the pavement. The\
    \ Miller’s golden retriever was already huffing at the gate two houses ahead,\
    \ and the schedule was a master that brooked no delays.\n\nOn Tuesday, the master\
    \ died.\n\nAt the corner of Trumbull and Bagley, a wall of orange mesh stood guard.\
    \ A backhoe sat idling, its diesel breath thick and oily. The sidewalk was gone,\
    \ replaced by a raw trench of Detroit clay.\n\nTeddy stopped. The world didn't\
    \ just change; it tilted. A sharp, cold ringing started in his ears, drowning\
    \ out the engine’s roar. He reached out, his fingers fumbling for a fence post\
    \ that had been torn down yesterday, his breath coming in shallow, ragged hitches.\
    \ Without the cracks in the concrete to guide him, the grief he’d been outrunning\
    \ caught up. He felt the crushing weight of the empty porch swing he’d left behind,\
    \ and the way he still reflexively checked his breast pocket for the grocery lists\
    \ Martha hadn't written in three years.\n\n\"Six months, Pops,\" a worker shouted\
    \ over the rattle of the backhoe. \"Gotta go through the alley.\"\n\nTeddy hesitated,\
    \ the gravel-choked vein behind the 4th Street row houses looking like a dark\
    \ tunnel. He turned into it, his thin soles crunching on unpaved earth. The air\
    \ here was different—damp soil and woodsmoke, a scent that hadn't reached the\
    \ main road in decades.\n\nHalfway down the block, he saw a young woman kneeling\
    \ in a patch of sun-drenched dirt behind a crumbling Victorian. She was surrounded\
    \ by plastic starter pots. \n\n\"You're ten minutes late,\" she said, her back\
    \ to him.\n\nTeddy blinked, his heart still hammering against his ribs. \"I...\
    \ I beg your pardon?\"\n\nShe turned, a smudge of dark earth across her cheek.\
    \ \"I see you every morning from my window. 6:20 sharp. I thought maybe you’d\
    \ finally decided to take a day off.\"\n\n\"I don't take days off,\" Teddy said,\
    \ his voice raspy. He looked at the plants, their serrated leaves familiar. \"\
    Milkweed?\"\n\n\"Good eye.\" She wiped her forehead with a muddy sleeve. \"I’m\
    \ Sarah. I’m trying to link the backyards together. The new glass buildings downtown\
    \ are like a wall to the Monarchs. They need a path through the noise.\"\n\nTeddy\
    \ looked at the plants. Martha used to spend hours in their backyard, her straw\
    \ sun hat bobbing as she tracked the orange-and-black wings. He hadn't planted\
    \ a single seed since her funeral; he’d been too busy walking in circles, keeping\
    \ his eyes on the cracks so he wouldn't have to see the neighborhood changing\
    \ without her.\n\n\"Martha—my wife—she used to say they were the bravest things\
    \ on earth,\" Teddy murmured. \"Traveling thousands of miles on wings no thicker\
    \ than paper.\"\n\nSarah smiled, holding out a spare trowel. \"Well, the ground\
    \ is hard and my wrist is shot. You look like a man who knows how to handle a\
    \ tool.\"\n\nTeddy looked at his clean, pressed slacks, then at the raw, inviting\
    \ earth. He knelt. The soil was cool and surprisingly soft against his palms.\
    \ As he dug the first hole, he realized he wasn't checking his watch or looking\
    \ for the next turn. He was just there, his fingers deep in the dirt, no longer\
    \ counting the minutes.\n\nEDITOR'S CRITIQUE:\n# STORY CRITIQUE\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION:\
    \ character_interiority**\n\n**SCORE: 0.72**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- \"Lately, his\
    \ mind was often elsewhere\" (vague rumination)\n- \"he'd been too busy walking\
    \ in circles, keeping his eyes on the cracks so he wouldn't have to see the neighborhood\
    \ changing without her\" (strong specific avoidance)\n- \"the grief he'd been\
    \ outrunning caught up\" (tells rather than shows)\n\n**FEEDBACK:** Teddy's inner\
    \ life has moments of richness, but peaks and valleys unevenly. The best moment—\"\
    keeping his eyes on the cracks so he wouldn't have to see\"—reveals his avoidance\
    \ strategy through action. However, lines like \"the grief he'd been outrunning\
    \ caught up\" *name* the emotion rather than letting us experience it through\
    \ thought or sensation. Strengthen interiority by adding more visceral, specific\
    \ thoughts when Teddy encounters triggers (the coffee shop door, the trembling\
    \ hand). What exactly runs through his mind? Does he imagine conversations with\
    \ Martha? Does he calculate how many more loops he has left? This specificity\
    \ would deepen connection.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: constraint_satisfaction**\n\n\
    **SCORE: 0.90**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Routine detail: \"The outer heels of Teddy's\
    \ SAS walking shoes were shaved into a specific topography, a slanted record of\
    \ forty years\"\n- Disruption reveals avoidance: The blocked sidewalk forces confrontation\
    \ with grief and isolation\n- Neighbor: Sarah with clear intersection point (\"\
    You're ten minutes late\")\n- Absence: \"the single plate in the rack,\" \"the\
    \ grocery lists Martha hadn't written in three years,\" the porch swing\n- New\
    \ path: The alley and Sarah's garden project offer connection and living purpose\n\
    \n**FEEDBACK:** All five constraints are satisfied. However, *constraint 3* (neighbor's\
    \ story) is underdeveloped—Sarah exists primarily as a catalyst. Consider: Does\
    \ Sarah have her own loss or reason for this project? What does *her* story reveal\
    \ beyond being Teddy's mirror? One detail about her sacrifice or persistence would\
    \ enrich this intersection without needing a subplot.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: beat_execution**\n\
    \n**SCORE: 0.78**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- YOU: ✓ The 6:05 AM routine, the \"master\
    \ that brooked no delays\"\n- NEED: ⚠ \"He reached for the brass handle...but\
    \ the sudden image of his own kitchen...made his hand tremble. He pulled back.\"\
    \ (Implicit rather than earned)\n- GO: ✓ The sidewalk disruption forces the alley\
    \ route\n- SEARCH: ✓ \"He knelt. The soil was cool...no longer counting the minutes\"\
    \n\n**FEEDBACK:** The NEED beat is the weak link. Teddy *wants* human connection\
    \ (the coffee shop moment suggests this), but this desire isn't clearly articulated\
    \ before the disruption. Currently, the story presents: comfort → disruption →\
    \ meeting neighbor. A stronger version would establish his specific want first.\
    \ Example: Show him nearly entering the coffee shop multiple times before pulling\
    \ back, or demonstrate his loneliness more actively. This would make the disruption\
    \ feel like a response to genuine want, not just circumstantial luck. The Search\
    \ beat is strong—his adaptation to planting shows real change.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION:\
    \ subtlety**\n\n**SCORE: 0.81**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Excellent: \"his thumb tracing\
    \ the smooth, sweat-darkened handle of his walking stick\" (shows anxiety without\
    \ naming it)\n- Excellent: \"he still reflexively checked his breast pocket for\
    \ the grocery lists Martha hadn't written\" (grief through action)\n- Weak: \"\
    the grief he'd been outrunning caught up\" (tells emotions directly)\n- Weak:\
    \ \"Without the cracks in the concrete to guide him, the grief he'd been outrunning\
    \ caught up\" (too explanatory)\n\n**FEEDBACK:** Your best moments bury emotion\
    \ in physical detail. The walking stick tracing, the breast pocket check, the\
    \ trembling hand—these are masterful. But you occasionally resort to naming the\
    \ feeling: \"the sharp, cold ringing started in his ears\" works, but following\
    \ it with \"Without the cracks...the grief...caught up\" explains the feeling\
    \ rather than trusting the reader. Trust your sensory work more. Consider: Can\
    \ you remove \"the grief he'd been outrunning caught up\" and let the preceding\
    \ images (the fence post fumbling, the ragged breath) speak for themselves? Your\
    \ restraint elsewhere proves you can do this.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: narrative_quality**\n\
