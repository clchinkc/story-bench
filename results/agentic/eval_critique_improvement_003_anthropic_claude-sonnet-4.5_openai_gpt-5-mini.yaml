  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece moved from a promising opening (V0) with a
    slightly awkward image "workbench floating gently" to a tighter phrasing in V1
    and then to a substantially expanded V3 that adds key beats and stakes. V1 fixed
    the mildly jarring description; V3 preserves the original youthful register ("Holy
    crap," voice cracking, impulsive choices) while adding the map reveal, Gran''s
    dismissal, the introduction of Captain Chen with a clear, specific flaw (overcaution
    born of loss), Zara''s invented solar-panel-from-calculators, and an actual dangerous
    crossing through storm-churned Shallows. Overall the revisions respond to critiques
    about voice and clarity: youth voice is retained and strengthened, weaknesses
    in phrasing were smoothed, and new material improves stakes and worldbuilding
    without losing earlier strengths.'
