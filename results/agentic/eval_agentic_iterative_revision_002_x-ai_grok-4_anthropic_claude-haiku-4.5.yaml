  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→1 added sensory depth (dust on tongue, metallic
    bite). Version 1→2 showed minimal change (truncated text). Version 2→3 dramatically
    elevated through hyphenated sensory compounds (cumin-and-garlic sizzle, iron-laced
    bite, jagged staccato, rust-flecked scaffolding), creating visceral immersion.
    Final output maintained these gains while expanding narrative scope significantly.
    Clear progression from adequate to strong.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Non-visual sensory details PROMINENT—exceptional
    execution with taste (dust coating throat, café con leche steam), smell (cumin-garlic,
    pine cologne, coppery stink, cheap pennies), touch (humidity like clammy shirt,
    barbed wire coil), sound (dominant throughout). (2) Blindness as STRENGTH—Imani''s
    audio memory, exceptional hearing, and sensory orchestration are portrayed as
    investigative superpowers, not limitations. She solves the case through her abilities.
    (3) SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE—''La Cucaracha'' ringtone is crucial: identifies Marco,
    times the crime, becomes a threat motif, drives plot. Excellently integrated.
    (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION—Detective Ruiz dismisses her immediately (''sound
    alone? Could be TV drama''), then reluctantly admits she''s right. Clear arc.
    (5) FUN AND GAMES ENTERTAINMENT—Live podcast episodes with café con leche interviews,
    witty banter (''crime''s a mismatched band''), fan engagement, roasting Ruiz playfully.
    Genuinely entertaining before Marco''s threats darken tone.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Inciting incident (argument/ringtone) is sharp. Detective skepticism
    creates tension. Fun and Games section balances humor with investigation—Mrs.
    Lopez''s observations, vendor details, Imani''s podcast commentary. Darkening
    turn (threats, Marco''s visit, cut phone line) is abrupt but effective. However,
    climax feels slightly rushed; the final confrontation setup lacks the sensory
    specificity of earlier sections. Resolution incomplete (intentionally, for serialization),
    which works for the format.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is vivid and immersive. Sensory language is sophisticated
    (not overwrought). Character voice is strong—Imani''s confidence, humor, and competence
    shine. Cultural specificity (Spanglish, Dominican/Puerto Rican details, bodega
    atmosphere) feels authentic. Pacing accelerates appropriately from setup through
    games to threat. Minor weakness: the transition from ''fun'' to ''dark'' could
    use one more beat of foreshadowing. The final paragraph''s metaphors (sonic web,
    barbed wire, symphony) are strong but slightly abstract compared to earlier concrete
    sensory work.


    STRENGTHS: Exceptional sensory writing; respectful, empowering portrayal of disability;
    audio clue is organic and plot-critical; underestimation arc is satisfying; entertainment
    value before darkness is genuine. GAPS: Climax resolution incomplete (acceptable
    for format); final beat slightly less grounded than earlier sections; could use
    one more sensory anchor in the threat sequence.'
