  evidence: The revisions show an attempt to address the emotional complexity, particularly
    in the later versions. The initial versions were very similar, but the final version
    adds more internal monologue for Marcus and introduces Lily earlier to set up
    the dynamic. The 'almost breaks' moment is also more clearly defined in the final
    version. However, the 'Save the Cat' beats are still not fully evident, and the
    industry authenticity could be stronger. The emotional complexity improved from
    the initial low scores, but still feels a bit rushed at the end.
