  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: "In the soot-stained village of Oakhaven, Elian spent his days feeding\
    \ the hunger of the furnace. While other youths dreamed of wielding the steel\
    \ he helped shape, Elian found his peace in the rhythm of the hammer. He was a\
    \ mere apprentice, yet his hands possessed a rare intuition for the \"breath\"\
    \ of metal.\n\nThe darkness threatening the Kingdom of Aethelgard was not a shroud\
    \ of night, but a creeping rot of the soul. Lord Malcor, a usurper driven by cold\
    \ ambition, had seized the throne, plunging the land into a winter of tyranny.\
    \ His \"Darkness\" was the systematic crushing of hope, enforced by a legion of\
    \ iron-clad mercenaries who answered only to gold and fear.\n\n**The Call to Adventure**\n\
    The peace of the forge was shattered when a dying messenger stumbled through the\
    \ doors. He clutched a leather satchel containing nothing but jagged, cold shards\
    \ of silver-white metal. \"The Sun-Glass Crest,\" the messenger gasped. \"The\
    \ symbol of the true lineage. Malcor broke it to break our spirits. Without the\
    \ Crest, the resistance cannot unite. Reforge it... or the kingdom falls to the\
    \ rot.\"\n\n**Crossing the Threshold**\nElian looked at his master, old Thorne,\
    \ whose hands were too gnarled by palsy to do the work. \"I am just an apprentice,\"\
    \ Elian whispered. \n\n\"The metal doesn't care for titles, boy,\" Thorne replied.\
    \ \n\nWith his bellows and a portable anvil strapped to a mule, Elian slipped\
    \ past the village gates under the cover of a grey mist. He left the only home\
    \ he had ever known, venturing into the Wilds to find the Sacred Hearth—the only\
    \ forge hot enough to bind the Sun-Glass. He was pursued not by monsters, but\
    \ by Malcor’s scouts, men whose hearts were as hollow as the armor they wore.\n\
    \n**The Ordeal**\nElian reached the Sacred Hearth, hidden within a volcanic cavern,\
    \ just as Malcor’s elite vanguard surrounded the mountain. This was his Ordeal.\
    \ The shards of the Sun-Glass were temperamental; they resisted the heat, reflecting\
    \ Elian’s own doubts back at him. As the sounds of heavy boots echoed in the tunnels,\
    \ Elian realized he couldn't fight the soldiers. He had no skill with a blade.\
    \ His only weapon was his craft.\n\nInside the cavern, the air grew thin. Elian\
    \ worked with a feverish intensity. He didn't just hammer; he listened. He felt\
    \ the fractures in the silver-white shards and understood that they had been broken\
    \ by malice. To mend them, he had to apply a heat born of absolute focus. As the\
    \ first mercenary burst into the chamber, Elian struck the final blow. He didn't\
    \ swing the hammer at the soldier; he struck the Crest with a precision that sent\
    \ a resonant, harmonic chime echoing through the mountain.\n\n**The Resolution**\n\
    The craft was so perfect, the restoration so absolute, that the Sun-Glass Crest\
    \ flared with a brilliant, blinding light—not a magical explosion, but a physical\
    \ manifestation of the metal’s purity. The mercenaries, men who lived by the \"\
    darkness\" of Malcor’s cynical rule, were struck motionless by the sight of the\
    \ restored relic. The beauty of the craftsmanship spoke of a power greater than\
    \ Malcor’s cruelty: the power of restoration.\n\nSeeing the Crest whole, the soldiers’\
    \ resolve withered. They were reminded of the kingdom they had once sworn to protect\
    \ before Malcor’s gold corrupted them. Elian did not need to draw a sword. By\
    \ fixing what was broken, he broke the spell of Malcor’s fear. Word of the reforged\
    \ Crest spread like wildfire, sparking a bloodless revolution as the common folk\
    \ and soldiers alike turned toward the light of the restored symbol. Elian, the\
    \ apprentice, returned to his forge, but he was no longer just a boy with a hammer;\
    \ he was the smith who had mended a nation."
