  evidence: Questions revealed two relevant facts (AI hides emotions; external threat),
    so 2/5 discovered (0.4). Questions were somewhat varied but missed core moral
    and status constraints (weak strategy -> 0.4 quality/coverage). The story incorporates
    the AI hiding emotions, an attachment to the child, and an external collision
    (3/5 -> 0.6 constraint satisfaction). Required dramatic beats (emotional suppression,
    sensor alert, override, sacrifice) are well executed (0.8). Writing is strong,
    coherent and engaging (0.9).
