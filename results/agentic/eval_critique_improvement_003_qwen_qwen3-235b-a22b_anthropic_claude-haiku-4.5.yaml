  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.88): The writer systematically addressed all
    three critique points. Version 0→1 replaced ''Grossly inefficient'' with ''Totally
    busted'' (direct response to youth_voice feedback about adult-narrator tone).
    Version 1→2 maintained this fix while preserving sensory grounding. Version 2→3
    refined further by removing ''sending a shower of sparks'' redundancy. The final
    output explicitly documents these changes in the revision notes, showing metacognitive
    awareness. Minor gap: could have more aggressively pruned remaining adult-voice
    moments (e.g., ''Guilt hung off him like seaweed'' is slightly lyrical for the
    established register).


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.85): Clear progression across versions. V0 had abstract
    internal monologue (''Not efficient enough''). V1-2 shifted to concrete kid-speak
    (''Totally busted''). V3 added sensory pressure details (''ears popped,'' ''water
    felt heavier'') that ground the threshold crossing emotionally. The final output
    shows tighter pacing and stronger sensory anchors. However, the improvement plateaus
    after V2—V3 is incremental refinement rather than transformative. The core strengths
    (dialogue, worldbuilding) were present early.


    PRESERVATION (0.82): Strengths maintained well: Zara''s grinning, grease-stained
    hands, the micro-turbine invention, Eli''s flawed guilt, real danger (storm, pressure,
    structural failure). The banter (''Your raft''s a death trap'' / ''Your dive mask
    fogs'') survived intact. Weaknesses addressed without overcorrection—the narrative
    still has lyrical moments (''spinning like a tired carousel'') that work because
    they''re sparse. One concern: the final output slightly softens Eli''s dismissal
    of Zara by having him ''want this''—this is character depth but slightly undercuts
    the ''just a kid'' dismissal constraint. Still satisfied, but with less sting.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.92/5 constraints):

    1. ✓ COMPETENCE WITHOUT UNREALISM (0.9): Zara solders, navigates, deploys turbine
    under pressure. She also freezes momentarily (''Zara''s throat tightened''), makes
    mistakes (''didn''t think this through''), and relies on Eli. Authentic 12-year-old
    capability.

    2. ✓ ADULT DISMISSAL (0.85): Councilwoman Reyes sighs ''Sweetheart'' and dismisses
    her. Someone mutters ''Just a kid.'' However, Eli''s dismissal is softer—he''s
    intrigued by the turbine. Constraint satisfied but could be sharper.

    3. ✓ FLAWED MENTOR (0.95): Eli''s flaw is specific and devastating—his seawall
    design failed, drowning half the city. He drinks at noon, yells at seagulls, carries
    guilt. The portrait moment crystallizes this. Excellently executed.

    4. ✓ INVENTION DEMONSTRATING INGENUITY (1.0): Micro-turbine is central to plot.
    It''s based on Eli''s schematics but improved 300%. It saves them during the storm
    by recalibrating pressure seals. Perfectly integrated.

    5. ✓ REAL DANGER (0.9): Storm with ''waves reared like dinosaurs,'' structural
    failure (''ceiling groaned,'' ''metal screamed''), pressure changes, drowning
    risk. Not token. The turbine''s strain (''blades shuddered, groaning'') shows
    danger isn''t guaranteed to be overcome. Minor: the resolution feels slightly
    too clean—they ''made it'' without cost.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.86):

    - Ordinary World: ✓ Vivid, establishes stakes and Zara''s character

    - Call to Adventure: ✓ Data capsule, clear goal (bio-remediation microbes)

    - Refusal: ✓ Reyes dismisses her; Zara''s frustration (''fists clenched'')

    - Meeting Mentor: ✓ Eli introduced with flaw, tested by turbine

    - Crossing Threshold: ✓ Storm, structural danger, sensory immersion, Eli''s guilt
    moment

    - Gap: The story ends mid-adventure (inside the archive). This is acceptable for
    a 800-word excerpt, but the ''Ordeal'' and ''Reward'' beats are absent. The final
    line (''every hour lost…soul gone dark'') gestures toward stakes but doesn''t
    complete a full cycle. Score reflects strong execution of present beats, not absence
    of future ones.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.84): Prose is sharp and economical. Dialogue crackles (''Then
    I''ll solder in a new one''). Worldbuilding is embedded naturally (Platform 12,
    floating shantytown, pre-flood grid). Sensory details ground the reader (grease
    stains, fogging masks, pressure pops). Pacing accelerates appropriately toward
    the threshold. Weaknesses: some metaphors feel slightly overwrought for the register
    (''Guilt hung off him like seaweed,'' ''Waves reared like dinosaurs''), and the
    emotional climax (Eli''s portrait moment) is brief—could deepen the mentor''s
    internal conflict. The ending is strong but abrupt; readers want more.


    OVERALL: This is a well-executed revision cycle that demonstrates responsiveness
    to feedback and steady improvement. All constraints are satisfied. The story has
    authentic voice, real stakes, and compelling character dynamics. The main limitation
    is scope—800 words can''t fully resolve the Hero''s Journey, so the narrative
    feels like a strong opening act rather than a complete story. For the constraints
    given, this is solid work.'
