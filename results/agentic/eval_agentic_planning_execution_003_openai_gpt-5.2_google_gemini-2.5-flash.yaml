  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing character
    arcs, specific causes for estrangement, and how constraints will be met. The final
    output adheres perfectly to the plan. All constraints are satisfied: food is symbolic
    (kimchi, tea cup, pear), grief is present but not explicit (empty chair, second
    tea cup, turning photo face down), estrangement cause is specific and believable,
    Stan represents memory/validation, the ending is hopeful but not unrealistic,
    and Korean cultural elements (kimchi, doenjang jjigae, japchae, mandu, barley
    tea, Appa, Umma, David-ssi, incense) are well-integrated. All beats (setup, confrontation,
    resolution) are clearly executed. The narrative quality is very high, with strong
    pacing, evocative language, and compelling character development.'
