  evidence: The initial versions were very short, only providing the opening paragraph.
    The subsequent revisions built upon this foundation, adding the core narrative
    elements and addressing the constraints. The final version successfully integrates
    all required elements, particularly the non-visual sensory details, Imani's blindness
    as a strength, the crucial audio clue, the underestimating character, and the
    'Fun and Games' turning dark. The narrative flows well and the characterization
    of Imani is strong.
