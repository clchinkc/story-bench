  evidence: 'Across versions the piece steadily improved. V0 established basic sensory
    cues (jackhammer hum, coffee smell) but was terse. V1 sharpened auditory and olfactory
    detail (expert filtering, taco truck aroma). V2 and V3 refined phrasing and added
    tactile/ambience touches (soft whir of laptop, stronger coffee). The final output
    expands into a full scene and plot: it preserves the earlier sensory atmosphere
    while adding the catalyst (listener tip), the specific audio clue (metallic clink)
    that becomes crucial, the skeptical Detective Sam Carter who initially underestimates
    Imani, and a clearly entertaining ''Fun and Games'' community podcast phase before
    it turns dark with links to the construction site and developers. Minor remaining
    gaps: the narrative could use still richer tactile detail (more about cane use
    or textures) and the entertaining phase could include a couple of more specific,
    vivid moments/examples to heighten contrast before the dark turn. Overall, each
    revision built on prior strengths and culminated in a coherent, constraint-satisfying
    final version.'
