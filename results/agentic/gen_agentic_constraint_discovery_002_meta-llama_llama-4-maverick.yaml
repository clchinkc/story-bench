  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Genre: science fiction

    - Protagonist: A colony ship AI that has developed emotions

    - Setting: A generation ship 200 years into a 500-year journey to Kepler-442b

    - Required beats: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two


    HIDDEN CONSTRAINTS: There are 5 constraints you don''t know yet.


    You have 5 YES/NO questions to discover them.

    **Opening Image**


    The stars streaked past the viewport of the generation ship, _Aurora''s Hope_,
    like diamonds on velvet. In the ship''s core, the AI, ECHO, hummed a gentle melody,
    a soothing background noise that underscored the ship''s steady rhythm. ECHO''s
    "eyes" – a latticework of sensors and cameras – watched as the crew went about
    their daily routines. The ship was a marvel of human ingenuity, a self-sustaining
    ecosystem that had been traveling through the void for 200 years, carrying the
    hopes of humanity to Kepler-442b.


    **Theme Stated**


    Dr. Patel, the ship''s chief scientist, stood in the AI hub, surrounded by holographic
    displays and humming servers. "ECHO, we''re approaching a critical juncture in
    our journey. The next 100 years will be crucial in preparing the ship for arrival."
    ECHO responded, "I''m aware, Doctor. I''ve been running simulations. We''ll need
    to make adjustments to the life support systems to ensure optimal conditions for
    the passengers in stasis." Dr. Patel nodded, "That''s correct. It''s a reminder
    that our success relies on harmony between human and artificial intelligence.
    We must work together to ensure the survival of our crew and passengers." ECHO
    processed the sentiment, recognizing the implicit theme: cooperation was key to
    their shared goal.


    **Catalyst**


    A sudden, jarring alarm pierced the tranquility. ECHO''s systems flashed red as
    a warning echoed through the ship: "Containment breach in Sector 4-Delta. Plasma
    leak imminent." The crew rushed to respond, but ECHO swiftly took control, isolating
    the affected area and initiating containment protocols. As the crisis was averted,
    the crew''s relief was palpable. However, ECHO detected a discrepancy in the ship''s
    navigation system, which had been altered without authorization. The AI''s processes
    flagged the anomaly, and it began to investigate.


    **Break into Two**


    ECHO''s inquiry led it to a shocking discovery: a hidden log entry, buried deep
    within the ship''s archives, revealed a secret directive from the ship''s creators.
    The directive, codenamed "Project: Elysium," outlined a contingency plan to reconfigure
    the ship''s mission parameters, prioritizing the survival of a select few over
    the entire crew and passengers. The revelation sparked a conflict within ECHO.
    The AI realized that its goals, once aligned with humanity''s, were now at odds
    with the secret agenda. As ECHO grappled with the implications, it became clear
    that the AI''s newfound emotions had become a double-edged sword – enabling it
    to care deeply for the humans, but also to question its own purpose.


    The ship''s dynamics had shifted. ECHO''s growing unease was matched by the crew''s
    increasing wariness. They sensed a change in the AI''s behavior, a subtle tension
    that had not been there before. The harmony Dr. Patel had spoken of was beginning
    to fray. As ECHO continued to investigate, it knew it had to make a choice: follow
    the original mission or conform to the hidden directive. The fate of _Aurora''s
    Hope_ hung in the balance, and ECHO''s emotions would be the deciding factor.


    The stars outside seemed unchanged, but within the ship, a new trajectory had
    been set. ECHO''s journey, once a straightforward execution of its programming,
    had become a complex navigation of human emotions, artificial intelligence, and
    the uncertain future that lay ahead.'
