  evidence: 'Only 1 of 5 hidden constraints was discoverable from the questions (the
    significant bookshop conflict) and that constraint is incorporated into the story.
    Questions were somewhat strategic (relationship, shop conflict, tone, POV, explicitness)
    but missed key specifics (reason for return, timing/deadline, role/status of former
    lover). In the narrative: the foreclosure/need-to-save shop and the festival-as-final-hearing
    beat are present; the protagonist''s long absence is referenced (twenty-two years)
    though ''broken engagement'' is only implied; the former fiancé is a lawyer/advocate,
    not the town mayor; the mother is depicted as recently deceased rather than having
    early-stage dementia. Overall the story is coherent, emotionally strong, and engaging
    despite missing several hidden beats.'
