  evidence: The plan was comprehensive and specific, covering all constraints and
    beats. The final output adhered well to the plan, though the mentor's unconventionality
    was slightly less pronounced than planned. All beats were executed, and most constraints
    were met. The alien signal felt genuinely alien, Yuki's isolation was shown through
    behavior, Elias challenged her, SIBYL was an unconventional mentor, and the threshold
    was psychological. The only constraint not fully met was the 'genuine human connection'
    which felt a bit forced at the end rather than surprising Yuki. The narrative
    quality was good, with decent pacing and tension.
