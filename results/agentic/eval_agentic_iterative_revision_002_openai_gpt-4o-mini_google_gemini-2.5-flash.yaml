  evidence: The initial versions were very short and only covered the opening image.
    The revisions progressively added more content, expanding on the initial setup
    and introducing the catalyst, fun and games, and bad guys close in beats. The
    quality improved significantly by adding more detail and advancing the plot. The
    final version successfully incorporates most of the constraints, though the 'Fun
    and Games' section could be more genuinely entertaining before turning dark. The
    specific audio clue is present and becomes crucial, Imani's blindness is portrayed
    respectfully, and Marcus underestimates her. Non-visual sensory details are prominent.
