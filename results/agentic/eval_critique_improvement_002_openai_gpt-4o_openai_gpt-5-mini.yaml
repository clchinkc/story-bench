  evidence: 'Across the revision rounds there was only incremental polishing rather
    than substantive change. The story preserved its core strengths (authentic writers''
    room details, specific joke-crafting beats, and the Hannah–Marcus dynamic), but
    it failed to address the most important structural critique: the chronology of
    humor versus revealed sadness (the opening already signals Marcus''s void, so
    the required laugh-before-we-realize-he''s-sad constraint remains unmet). Emotional
    complexity was present but still telegraphed; the ‘mask slipping’ moment exists
    but is explicit rather than subtly earned. Save-the-Cat elements (Theme Stated,
    Set-Up, B Story) appear, but many beats are underdeveloped or collapsed due to
    the short form, so overall beat execution is weak.'
