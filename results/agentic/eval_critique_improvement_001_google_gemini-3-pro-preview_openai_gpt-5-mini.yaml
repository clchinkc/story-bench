  evidence: Across the critique rounds the piece retained its strongest elements (the
    precise physical actions establishing Sarah, the fog’s active interference, the
    hinting of her past) while making modest, focused refinements. Later versions
    emphasize the fog as an evidence-erasing force and sharpen Miller’s nervous lie
    and Sarah’s physiological ticks, and they move the reveal of the Sculptor so it
    follows earlier hints. Changes are incremental rather than sweeping—quality improved
    in clarity and narrative function, but the revisions mostly polished and reinforced
    existing strengths rather than altering structure.
