  evidence: 'All five questions asked only about narrative tense/person and never
    probed plot constraints, so no hidden constraints were discoverable (0/5). The
    final story does satisfy two hidden constraints: it reforges the broken ancestral
    sword (Daystar) and the protagonist does not cast magic directly (uses hedge-witch''s
    dawn-water and personal blood). It fails to show the mentor dying during the Ordeal,
    omits any three-day time limit, and gives no backstory about the protagonist''s
    father being a failed hero. Beats around the Ordeal are present (forging scene)
    but the crucial mentor-death beat and time-pressure beat are missing, reducing
    beat execution.'
