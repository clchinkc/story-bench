  evidence: Only one hidden constraint was discoverable from the questions (presence
    of an additional character) and that was realized in the story (Helric, Serah).
    The other four hidden constraints (mentor must die in the Ordeal; protagonist
    cannot use magic directly; three-day time limit; father was a failed hero; victory
    requires reforing an ancestral sword) were not revealed by the questions and are
    not satisfied in the text (mentor survives, Rowan indirectly triggers runic/magical
    effect by throwing the sword, no time limit or father backstory, victory comes
    from a shard rather than reforging). The questions were simple yes/no and touched
    general areas (character, voice, theme, non-human, length) but failed to probe
    plot mechanics, temporal constraints, character fates, or artifact-specific requirements.
