  evidence: 'Across the revision rounds the piece tightened rather than rewrote: the
    youth voice was preserved and sharpened (earlier similes were pared to more childlike,
    immediate images), the adult dismissal becomes explicit (Kincaid: “You’re just
    a kid”), and a clearly inventive gadget (the Gullwing, plus skitter and skimmer
    fin) is introduced and integrated into action. The mentor (Tobin) was clarified
    as a flawed guide—physically impaired and trauma-affected—rather than a perfect
    expert. The crossing escalated from an implied risk to concrete, dangerous obstacles
    (live wires, rebar forests, storm wash) with tactile beats of danger. Some Hero’s
    Journey beats are present (call/finds archive, refusal/dismissal, mentor allies,
    threshold crossing, ordeal) but the arc stops mid-ordeal/return in the provided
    excerpt, so beat execution is adequate but not fully resolved. Strengths (voice,
    worldbuilding, stakes) were preserved while weaknesses noted in critiques were
    addressed.'
