  evidence: V0 was a fragmentary opening establishing Mateo, setting and stakes but
    lacking scenes and resolution. V1 showed little change. V2 expanded sensory and
    cultural detail (piñata shops, carne asada, bilingual duty), improving authenticity
    and character texture. The final version preserves those elements and adds the
    crucial crystallizing Abuela scene (album, photo, confession about leaving painting
    behind), an adult who truly understands (Mr. Vargas sharing his parallel story),
    clearer depiction of Mateo's inner turmoil through actions and physical reactions
    (sneaking sketches, balled-up drawings, the lie about the party, tear-streaked
    reflection), and an earned resolution (mailing UCLA portfolio while maintaining
    family duties and earning Papá's reluctant nod). Overall the drafts moved from
    setup to a fully realized arc that addresses the specified constraints.
