  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan comprehensively addresses all required beats with clear
    structure. Final output successfully executes Setup (demolition letter, kimchi
    memory, Mr. Kim introduction), Confrontation (heated argument about restaurant
    vs. family), and Resolution (retirement decision, walking away together). Food
    symbolism appears twice effectively (kimchi as wife memory, bibimbap as harmony/balance).
    Estrangement cause is specific and believable (David''s work immersion after wife''s
    death neglected Mia). Mr. Kim represents tradition/continuity. Samulnori drumming
    provides Korean cultural element beyond food. Ending is hopeful but measured—retirement
    and California move with recipe book, not unrealistic reconciliation. Grief is
    present implicitly throughout (wife references, restaurant as anchor) without
    explicit statement. WEAKNESSES: One constraint partially underexecuted—the hopeful
    ending borders on slightly too neat (Mia extends stay, they perform memorial together,
    walk away united). While not unrealistic, it could be more bittersweet. Plan specificity
    could be stronger in Act 3 details. Output pacing slightly rushed in final section—resolution
    compresses multiple emotional beats into final paragraphs. Narrative quality is
    solid but somewhat predictable in arc. Mr. Kim''s illness feels somewhat convenient
    as plot device rather than organically integrated. TECHNICAL: Plan-to-output adherence
    is strong; final story follows planned structure faithfully with minor compression.
    All beats present and functional, though Resolution could develop more gradually.'
