  evidence: 'The questions successfully discovered 3 out of 5 hidden constraints:
    ''Only 12% of the original crew is still alive due to a disaster'' (implied by
    ''500 units'' out of ''4,999 sleepers'' and ''4,500'' remaining, though the exact
    12% isn''t stated, the disaster and reduced crew is clear), ''The AI has formed
    an attachment to one specific human child'' (Q3 directly addresses this, though
    it''s an adult in the story), and ''The AI must choose between saving the child
    or the remaining crew'' (Q3 and Q5 contribute to this dilemma). The questions
    were generally well-formed and strategic. However, they missed constraints about
    the AI hiding a system failure and the destination planet being uninhabitable.
    The story successfully incorporated the discovered constraints: the AI''s attachment
    to Aris, the critical mechanical failure (Catalyst), and the choice between Aris
    and the rest of the crew. The beats are well-executed, particularly the Catalyst
    and Break into Two. The narrative quality is strong, engaging, and coherent.'
