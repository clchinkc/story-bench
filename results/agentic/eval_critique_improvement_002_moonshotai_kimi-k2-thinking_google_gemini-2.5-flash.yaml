  evidence: The revisions consistently built upon the initial draft, refining the
    emotional arc and ensuring all constraints were met. The core strengths of the
    initial setup (Marcus's humor, the writers' room setting) were preserved while
    the pathos and character depth were significantly enhanced. The final version
    successfully integrates the feedback, particularly around Marcus's internal struggle
    and the impact of Nina's presence. The critiques highlighted the emotional complexity,
    and the final version delivers on this by showing Marcus's internal conflict and
    his eventual, subtle shift.
