    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: 'The whiteboards were already bleeding dry-erase when Marcus Webb slid
    into his chair, pointed his pen like a conductor’s baton, and said, “Okay, so
    Mom’s ‘win’ can’t be that she gets her job back. That’s not a win, that’s Stockholm
    syndrome with dental.” The room chuckled. He tapped a card that read: MOM FINDS
    HER SPINE—BUT QUIETLY. “Tag: she returns the office cactus that outlived her.
    Button: she keeps the pot.”


    He could do this with a hangover or a hurricane or a note from Standards & Practices
    asking if ‘butt’ could be ‘rear.’ Jokes were muscle memory. On the board, comic
    scaffolding: A-STORY: MOM/WORKPLACE BETRAYAL. B-STORY: KID RUNNING BLACK-MARKET
    SNACK CART. RUNNER: DAD VS. PICKLE JAR. There were arrows and red stars and a
    skull near Act Two that meant look out—emotional beat.


    “Can the pickle jar be emotional?” someone asked.


    Marcus didn’t look up. “Everything’s emotional if you can’t open it,” he said,
    and the room laughed again. The laugh was warm and professional and stopped exactly
    when everyone remembered there were twenty-six minutes of affluent relatability
    to build by six.


    Opening image: Marcus in his element, this: a writer’s room at nine a.m., half-finished
    La Croixs like pearls in a tide pool, the desperate ballet of being funny on command.
    He was the guy who could give you five alts and a runner tag while proofreading
    his own cynicism. He was also the guy who hadn’t laughed at anything he didn’t
    write in three years, but that was a footnote in an outline he refused to turn
    in.


    Drea, the script coordinator, pushed in with a stack of network notes and a well-timed
    eye roll. “There’s a new staff writer coming from Caitlin Chen’s show,” she said,
    distributing pain. “Starts today.” She paused, glanced at Marcus’s scribbles,
    then added, as if it were a footnote that mattered, “Also, the theme of the pilot
    is not ‘we’re all doomed.’” The room snorted. Drea shrugged. “Comedy’s just telling
    the truth soft enough people keep listening.”


    He logged the line the way he logged everything—useless truth as street noise—and
    clipped it for later. Theme stated. Fine. He tapped his pen against his knee.


    The door opened. A woman in an oversized denim jacket and sneakers that said she’d
    walked Los Feliz to prove a point stepped in. She introduced herself as Elena
    Park. She didn’t apologize. She didn’t beam. She took in the board like a crime
    scene.


    “Big fan of Caitlin,” someone said.


    Elena smiled half a centimeter. “She’s a monster in a good way.”


    Marcus watched her clock the room, clock him, clock the groove-worn track of punch-ups
    they traveled every day. There was a moment when new writers tried to present
    as chaos or sugar; she didn’t. She took a seat, pulled a notebook, and wrote “PICKLE
    = PRIDE,” underlining it twice.


    Catalyst: she arrived and did not ask permission.


    “Let’s go back to the cold open,” the showrunner said. “We’re still soft.”


    Marcus spun a card. “We come in on Mom, pre-lay, scraping icing off a cake into
    a dumbbell. Voiceover: ‘Self-care.’ Smash to her in the break room, eating the
    icing with a dumbbell. Joke landing: she’s pretending it’s protein.”


    Elena raised a hand. “What if it’s not her pretending,” she said. “What if she’s
    training for a thing that nobody knows about yet? Like, she’s doing push-ups off-camera
    in Act One, and by Act Three, she flips a desk for someone else.”


    Marcus felt the old reflex come up like bile. “Desk flipping’s expensive,” he
    said. “And human hope rarely tests well.”


    She looked at him, not the board. “You mean with you or with Nielsen?”


    The room did that micro-freeze it did when a stray truth wandered in and sat down.
    Marcus grinned so easily he almost fooled himself. “I’m actually a big hope guy,”
    he said. “Ask…literally any jar I’ve ever attempted.”


    Someone tossed him a pickle jar from the craft services table. He mimed struggling,
    made an orgasm face, and the room laughed. He set it down, perfectly upright and
    unopened.


    They broke story. They built bones. They cut jokes that were too mean to the character
    who couldn’t defend herself and alts that were smarter but felt like homework.
    Elena pitched a runner line, “He looks like if a golden retriever dropped out
    of business school,” and Marcus interlaced with, “He looks like LinkedIn made
    a man.” The board absorbed both. They debated whether the kid’s snack cart should
    be legal. They argued the ethics of a stolen Keurig pod. They locked the Act Two
    blow on a reluctant reveal that Mom had been demoted, not laid off.


    He almost broke at lunch. The light in the kitchen was the color of stale sourdough
    and he was in mid-swipe of microwaved noodles when Drea said, “Hey, when was the
    last time you really laughed?” Like it was weather. Like it was a thing that could
    be remembered without it scraping bone.


    For a second the room fuzzed, like a bad stream. He saw the edge of a stand-up
    stage from years ago and his wife’s hands clapping in a way that was not strategic,
    and all the air got sticky.

    \n**SCORE: 0.88**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Humor landing: \"Everything's emotional\
    \ if you can't open it\" (laugh) followed by \"he was also the guy who hadn't\
    \ laughed at anything he didn't write in three years\" (pathos)\n- The contrast\
    \ between the orgasm-face pickle jar bit and the kitchen scene where Marcus \"\
    almost broke\" watching his wife's hands\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The story expertly plants\
    \ sadness within comedy, but the tonal shift in the kitchen feels rushed. Currently:\
    \ \"For a second the room fuzzed...all the air got sticky. 'Since Blockbuster\
    \ was a streaming—'\" The joke deflection cuts off mid-sentence. Consider extending\
    \ this beat by 1-2 more lines so we feel the full weight of Marcus suppressing\
    \ emotion before he pivots. The laugh-then-sad rhythm works, but the almost-break\
    \ needs to breathe longer to land with gut-punch force.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION:\
    \ constraint_satisfaction**\n\n**SCORE: 0.92**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n1. ✓ Laugh before\
    \ sadness: \"Everything's emotional if you can't open it\" + pickle jar bit precede\
    \ the pathos reveal\n2. ✓ Theme by minor character: Drea states it—\"Comedy's\

    \ specificity: A-STORY/B-STORY cards, runner tags, the skull emoji meaning emotional\
    \ beat, punch-up workflow, Nielsen testing discussion\n4. ✓ Elena sees through:\
    \ \"You mean with you or with Nielsen?\" directly challenges his deflection\n\
    5. ✓ Almost breaks/covers: Kitchen scene with wife memory → Blockbuster joke pivot\n\
    \n**FEEDBACK:** All constraints are satisfied. Minor note: Elena's challenge (\"\
    You mean with you or with Nielsen?\") could be followed by a beat where Marcus\
    \ *feels* seen before he recovers—right now his recovery (\"I'm actually a big\
    \ hope guy\") is instantaneous. Adding half a line of silence or physical reaction\
    \ would emphasize how her observation penetrated his armor.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION:\

    \ stated: \"Opening image: Marcus in his element, this: a writer's room at nine\

    \ Drea delivers via \"Comedy's just telling the truth soft enough people keep\
    \ listening\"\n- Catalyst explicitly labeled: \"Catalyst: she arrived and did\
    \ not ask permission\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** Strong execution, but the Catalyst could\
    \ be more *disruptive*. Currently Elena arrives and is competent; she pitches\
    \ \"PICKLE = PRIDE\" and suggests the desk flip. This is solid, but Save the Cat's\
    \ Catalyst should shake Marcus's world—it should be the moment where his status\
    \ quo becomes impossible to maintain. Right now, it's just \"new smart person\
    \ joins.\" Consider having Elena's presence or first pitch directly contradict\
    \ something Marcus has established as law (\"Hope rarely tests well\"). The conflict\
    \ is there, but could be more pointed.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: industry_authenticity**\n\
    \n**SCORE: 0.94**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Bureaucratic accuracy: \"Standards & Practices\

    \n- Nielsen reference: Testing comedy with focus groups\n- Authentic room dynamics:\
    \ Timing of laughs, when people go quiet (\"The room did that micro-freeze\")\n\
    - Real comedy terminology: runner tags, A-story/B-story structure, alts, punch-ups\n\
    \n**FEEDBACK:** This is exceptional. The only refinement: when Marcus says \"\
    Ask…literally any jar I've ever attempted,\" it reads slightly *too* slick. Real\
    \ comedy writers in this situation would have a fraction more hesitation before\
    \ pivoting. The sentence feels polished in a way that breaks the \"caught\" moment.\
    \ Consider: \"Ask...uh, literally any jar\" to show the machinery briefly stalling\
    \ before he recovers into the physical bit.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: character_depth**\n\
    \n**SCORE: 0.80**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\n*Marcus:*\n- \"He could do this with a hangover\
    \ or a hurricane\" (adaptation/survival)\n- \"jokes were muscle memory\" + \"\
    hadn't laughed at anything he didn't write in three years\" (mastery masking emptiness)\n\
    - Almost-break revealing he had a wife; he once stood-up and laughed genuinely\n\

    Drea, the script coordinator, pushed in with a stack of network notes and a well-timed
    eye roll. “There’s a new staff writer coming from Caitlin Chen’s show,” she said,
    distributing pain. “Starts today.” She paused, glanced at Marcus’s scribbles,
    then added, as if it were a footnote that mattered, “Also, the theme of the pilot
    is not ‘we’re all doomed.’” The room snorted. Drea shrugged. “Comedy’s just telling
    the truth soft enough people keep listening.”


    He logged the line the way he logged everything—useless truth as street noise—and
    clipped it for later. He tapped his pen against his knee until the cap clicked.


    The door opened. A woman in an oversized denim jacket and sneakers that said she’d
    walked Los Feliz to prove a point stepped in. She introduced herself as Elena
    Park. She didn’t apologize. She didn’t beam. She took in the board like a crime
    scene.


    “Big fan of Caitlin,” someone said.


    Elena smiled half a centimeter. “She’s a monster in a good way.”


    She took a seat, pulled a notebook, and wrote “PICKLE = PRIDE,” underlining it
    twice.


    “Let’s go back to the cold open,” the showrunner said. “We’re still soft.”


    Marcus spun a card. “We come in on Mom, pre-lay, scraping icing off a cake into
    a dumbbell. Voiceover: ‘Self-care.’ Smash to her in the break room, eating the
    icing with a dumbbell. Joke landing: she’s pretending it’s protein.”


    Elena raised a hand. “What if it’s not her pretending,” she said. “What if she’s
    training for a thing nobody knows about yet? Like, she’s doing push-ups off-camera
    in Act One, and by Act Three, she flips a desk for someone else. Also—” She stood,
    reached for a neon sticky, and without touching the skull, posted a heart over
    it. “We flag the emotional beat as love, not danger.”


    “Desk flipping’s expensive,” Marcus said, reflex coiling. “And human hope rarely
    tests well.”


    She looked at him, not the board. “You mean with you or with Nielsen?”


    Silence vacuumed a breath. His pen stopped clicking; the cap had a tiny crack
    he hadn’t noticed. He smiled too quickly for it to be true. “I’m actually a big
    hope guy,” he said. “Ask…uh, literally any jar I’ve ever attempted.”


    Someone tossed him a pickle jar from the craft services table. He mimed struggling,
    made an orgasm face, and the room laughed. He set it down, perfectly upright and
    unopened. Catalyst: she arrived and, with a Post-it and a sentence, made his laws
    feel negotiable.

    She looked at him, not the board. “You mean with you or with Nielsen?”


    Silence vacuumed a breath. His pen stopped clicking; a tiny crack in the cap he
    hadn’t noticed pressed into his thumb. He smiled too quickly for it to be true.
    “I’m actually a big hope guy,” he said. “Ask…uh, literally any jar I’ve ever attempted.”


    Someone tossed him a pickle jar from the craft services table. He caught it, held
    it. His hand trembled once—barely—because a flash cut through: his wife’s wrists,
    thin and sure, twisting open a stubborn lid while he teased her about hidden forearms.
    For a beat, his eyes went empty, the kind of buffering you couldn’t joke over.
    Then he blinked, mimed struggling, made an obscene concentration face. The room
    laughed. He set the jar down, perfectly upright and unopened.


    Catalyst: she arrived and, with a Post-it and a sentence, made his laws feel negotiable—and
    visible.


    They broke story. They built bones. They cut jokes too mean for a character who
    couldn’t defend herself and alts that were smarter but felt like homework. Elena
    pitched a runner: “He looks like if a golden retriever dropped out of business
    school,” and Marcus interlaced, “He looks like LinkedIn made a man.” The board
    absorbed both. Then she went for the core.


    “What if Mom gets demoted, not laid off,” Elena said, “and she lies about it because
    she thinks her worth is her title. But in Act Three, she uses that same quiet
    to cover for someone else. She keeps the pot because she grew something ugly and
    still found it useful.”


    “That’s a drama beat,” Marcus said, automatic. “This is ABC at eight.”


    The showrunner scratched his beard. “It’s a family at eight. Put it on notecards.”


    A ripple ran through the room as they re-broked the A-story to land on consequence,
    not quip. Marcus’s outline math—setup, heighten, undercut—didn’t slot in clean.
    It made him itchy. Elena saw it. She didn’t gloat. She drew a tiny heart on another
    card and didn’t stick it anywhere.

    \ Complexity\n**SCORE: 0.75**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Strong opening: \"That's not\
    \ a win, that's Stockholm syndrome with dental\" (humor first)\n- Transition:\
    \ \"His phone buzzed. A photo app exhumed a memory: three years ago today—him\
    \ on a tiny stand-up stage, light like a wound\" (pathos second)\n- Pickle jar\
    \ breakdown: \"His hand trembled once—barely—because a flash cut through: his\

    \ For a beat, his eyes went empty, the kind of buffering you couldn't joke over.\
    \ Then he blinked, mimed struggling, made an obscene concentration face.\"\n\n\
    **FEEDBACK:** The story executes the tonal shift effectively—humor masks pain\
    \ is the core insight. However, the emotional stakes feel somewhat *observed*\
    \ rather than *experienced*. We understand Marcus's defense mechanism intellectually\
    \ but don't yet feel the weight of what he's defending against. The wife memory\
    \ is poignant but feels truncated—expand that sensory detail (the wrists, twisting,\
    \ his teasing) to give it more gravity before he performs over it. Consider exploring\
    \ what he's actually *afraid* of beyond professional obsolescence.\n\n---\n\n\

    \ under cover: The pickle jar tremor followed by the mimed struggle and \"obscene\
    \ concentration face\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** All constraints satisfied, but the story\
    \ cuts off before Elena's insight fully *lands* on Marcus. We see him smile \"\
    too quickly for it to be true\" but don't see the lasting effect. Have him remain\
    \ unsettled through the lunch break scene (which trails uncompleted). This would\

    \ when Marcus Webb slid into his chair, pointed his pen like a conductor’s baton,\
    \ and said, “Okay, so Mom’s ‘win’ can’t be that she gets her job back. That’s\
    \ not a win, that’s Stockholm syndrome with dental.” The room chuckled. He tapped\
    \ a card that read: MOM FINDS HER SPINE—BUT QUIETLY. “Tag: she returns the office\
    \ cactus that outlived her. Button: she keeps the pot.”\n\nHe could do this with\
    \ a hangover or a hurricane or a Standards & Practices email asking if “kill me”\
    \ could be “please destroy me emotionally” to appease a pharmaceutical sponsor.\
    \ Jokes were muscle memory. On the board, comic scaffolding: A-STORY: MOM/WORKPLACE\
    \ BETRAYAL. B-STORY: KID RUNNING BLACK-MARKET SNACK CART. RUNNER: DAD VS. PICKLE\
    \ JAR. Arrows. Red stars. A skull near Act Two that meant look out—emotional beat.\n\
    \nHis phone buzzed. A photo app exhumed a memory: three years ago today—him on\
    \ a tiny stand-up stage, light like a wound, his wife in the front row laughing\
    \ with her whole face. He clicked the notification away so fast his thumb ached.\n\
    \n“Can the pickle jar be emotional?” someone asked.\n\nMarcus didn’t look up.\
    \ “Everything’s emotional if you can’t open it,” he said, and the room laughed\
    \ again. The laugh was warm and professional and stopped exactly when everyone\
    \ remembered there were twenty-six minutes of affluent relatability to build by\
    \ six.\n\nOpening image: Marcus in his element, this: a writer’s room at nine\
    \ a.m., half-finished La Croixs like pearls in a tide pool, the desperate ballet\
    \ of being funny on command. He was the guy who could give you five alts and a\
    \ runner tag while proofreading his own cynicism. He was also the guy who hadn’t\
    \ laughed at anything he didn’t write in three years, but that was a footnote\
    \ in an outline he refused to turn in.\n\nDrea, the script coordinator, pushed\
    \ in with a stack of network notes and a well-timed eye roll. “There’s a new staff\
    \ writer coming from Caitlin Chen’s show,” she said, distributing pain. “Starts\
    \ today.” She paused, glanced at Marcus’s scribbles, then added, as if it were\
    \ a footnote that mattered, “Also, the theme of the pilot is not ‘we’re all doomed.’”\
    \ The room snorted. Drea shrugged. “Comedy’s just telling the truth soft enough\
    \ people keep listening.”\n\nHe logged the line the way he logged everything—useless\
    \ truth as street noise—and clipped it for later. He tapped his pen against his\
    \ knee until the cap clicked.\n\nThe door opened. A woman in an oversized denim\
    \ jacket and sneakers that said she’d walked Los Feliz to prove a point stepped\
    \ in. She introduced herself as Elena Park. She didn’t apologize. She didn’t beam.\
    \ She took in the board like a crime scene.\n\n“Big fan of Caitlin,” someone said.\n\
    \nElena smiled half a centimeter. “She’s a monster in a good way.”\n\nShe took\
    \ a seat, pulled a notebook, and wrote “PICKLE = PRIDE,” underlining it twice.\n\
    \n“Let’s go back to the cold open,” the showrunner said. “We’re still soft.”\n\
    \nMarcus spun a card. “We come in on Mom, pre-lay, scraping icing off a cake into\
    \ a dumbbell. Voiceover: ‘Self-care.’ Smash to her in the break room, eating the\
    \ icing with a dumbbell. Joke landing: she’s pretending it’s protein.”\n\nElena\
    \ raised a hand. “What if it’s not her pretending,” she said. “What if she’s training\
    \ for a thing nobody knows about yet? Like, she’s doing push-ups off-camera in\
    \ Act One, and by Act Three, she flips a desk for someone else. Also—” She stood,\
    \ reached for a neon sticky, and without touching the skull, posted a heart over\
    \ it. “We flag the emotional beat as love, not danger.”\n\n“Desk flipping’s expensive,”\
    \ Marcus said, reflex coiling. “And human hope rarely tests well.”\n\nShe looked\
    \ at him, not the board. “You mean with you or with Nielsen?”\n\nSilence vacuumed\
    \ a breath. His pen stopped clicking; a tiny crack in the cap he hadn’t noticed\
    \ pressed into his thumb. He smiled too quickly for it to be true. “I’m actually\
    \ a big hope guy,” he said. “Ask…uh, literally any jar I’ve ever attempted.”\n\
    \nSomeone tossed him a pickle jar from the craft services table. He caught it,\
    \ held it. His hand trembled once—barely—because a flash cut through: his wife’s\
    \ wrists, thin and sure, twisting open a stubborn lid while he teased her about\
    \ hidden forearms. For a beat, his eyes went empty, the kind of buffering you\
    \ couldn’t joke over. Then he blinked, mimed struggling, made an obscene concentration\
    \ face. The room laughed. He set the jar down, perfectly upright and unopened.\n\
    \nCatalyst: she arrived and, with a Post-it and a sentence, made his laws feel\
    \ negotiable—and visible.\n\nThey broke story. They built bones. They cut jokes\
    \ too mean for a character who couldn’t defend herself and alts that were smarter\
    \ but felt like homework. Elena pitched a runner: “He looks like if a golden retriever\
    \ dropped out of business school,” and Marcus interlaced, “He looks like LinkedIn\
    \ made a man.” The board absorbed both. Then she went for the core.\n\n“What if\
    \ Mom gets demoted, not laid off,” Elena said, “and she lies about it because\
    \ she thinks her worth is her title. But in Act Three, she uses that same quiet\
    \ to cover for someone else. She keeps the pot because she grew something ugly\
    \ and still found it useful.”\n\n“That’s a drama beat,” Marcus said, automatic.\
    \ “This is ABC at eight.”\n\nThe showrunner scratched his beard. “It’s a family\
    \ at eight. Put it on notecards.”\n\nA ripple ran through the room as they re-broked\
    \ the A-story to land on consequence, not quip. Marcus’s outline math—setup, heighten,\

    \ \"The Pickle Jar\"\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Emotional Complexity\n**SCORE: 0.75**\n\
    \n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Strong opening: \"That's not a win, that's Stockholm syndrome\
    \ with dental\" (humor first)\n- Transition: \"His phone buzzed. A photo app exhumed\
    \ a memory: three years ago today—him on a tiny stand-up stage, light like a wound\"\
    \ (pathos second)\n- Pickle jar breakdown: \"His hand trembled once—barely—because\
    \ a flash cut through: his wife's wrists, thin and sure, twisting open a stubborn\
    \ lid while he teased her... For a beat, his eyes went empty, the kind of buffering\
    \ you couldn't joke over. Then he blinked, mimed struggling, made an obscene concentration\
    \ face.\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The story executes the tonal shift effectively—humor\
    \ masks pain is the core insight. However, the emotional stakes feel somewhat\
    \ *observed* rather than *experienced*. We understand Marcus's defense mechanism\
    \ intellectually but don't yet feel the weight of what he's defending against.\
    \ The wife memory is poignant but feels truncated—expand that sensory detail (the\
    \ wrists, twisting, his teasing) to give it more gravity before he performs over\
    \ it. Consider exploring what he's actually *afraid* of beyond professional obsolescence.\n\
    \n---\n\n## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\n**SCORE: 0.92**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\
    1. ✓ Laugh before sadness: \"Stockholm syndrome with dental\" lands at :22 before\
    \ the wife photo at :08\n2. ✓ Minor character states theme: Drea says \"Comedy's\
    \ just telling the truth soft enough people keep listening\"\n3. ✓ Specific craft\
    \ detail: \"A-STORY: MOM/WORKPLACE BETRAYAL. B-STORY: KID RUNNING BLACK-MARKET\
    \ SNACK CART. RUNNER: DAD VS. PICKLE JAR. Arrows. Red stars.\"\n4. ✓ New writer\
    \ sees through Marcus: Elena deflects his cynicism: \"What if it's not her pretending...\
    \ You mean with you or with Nielsen?\" She directly calls his bluff.\n5. ✓ Almost-breaks\
    \ under cover: The pickle jar tremor followed by the mimed struggle and \"obscene\
    \ concentration face\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** All constraints satisfied, but the story\
    \ cuts off before Elena's insight fully *lands* on Marcus. We see him smile \"\
    too quickly for it to be true\" but don't see the lasting effect. Have him remain\
    \ unsettled through the lunch break scene (which trails uncompleted). This would\
    \ prove the catalyst has genuinely shaken him.\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Beat Execution\n\
