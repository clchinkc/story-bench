  evidence: 'The final output demonstrates strong responsiveness to critique feedback.
    Critique 1 (0.62) and Critique 2 (0.45) both flagged emotional_complexity concerns,
    noting the moment worked but lacked sufficient buildup and context. Critique 3
    (0.82) praised the core breakthrough moment but implied room for deeper character
    work. The revision trajectory shows meaningful improvement: (1) The Marcus-Riley
    dynamic was substantially deepened with her piercing observation about ''explaining
    vs. feeling,'' directly addressing the critique that emotional beats needed more
    weight. (2) The ''almost breaks'' constraint was elevated from a single moment
    to a full emotional arc—Marcus''s trembling hand, inability to breathe, the laugh-not-laugh
    sequence now anchors the entire turning point. (3) Theme articulation was strengthened:
    Sal''s line ''Comedy is about the gap between what we expect and what we fear''
    is delivered by a minor character (showrunner), satisfying the constraint explicitly.
    (4) Riley''s character was sharpened to demonstrate she ''sees through'' Marcus—she
    identifies his defensive structure (''you''re explaining the joke instead of writing
    it'') and names his actual fear (''the thing you''re afraid to write''). (5) Comedy
    craft specificity improved: buttons vs. toppers are now integrated into character
    conflict rather than exposition, with the soup metaphor becoming the vehicle for
    both technical instruction and emotional revelation. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:
    All 5 constraints met—(1) Marcus makes us laugh (''He apologizes to the soup'')
    before sadness emerges; (2) Theme stated by Sal, not Marcus; (3) Comedy craft
    shown through button/topper mechanics woven into character arc; (4) Riley demonstrates
    sophisticated perception (''That''s the lie you tell yourself''); (5) Marcus''s
    near-break with trembling hand and laugh-cry moment. WEAKNESSES: The final act
    (network executive scene) slightly dilutes focus—the emotional climax occurs mid-story,
    and the resolution feels somewhat rushed. The improvement from Critique 2 (0.45)
    to final output (0.88) shows 0.43-point gain, indicating substantial responsiveness.
    Preservation of strengths: the opening sensory detail, the whiteboard-as-battlefield
    metaphor, and the core breakthrough moment all remain intact while being deepened.'
