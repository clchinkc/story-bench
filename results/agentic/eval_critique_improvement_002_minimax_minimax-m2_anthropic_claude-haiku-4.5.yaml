  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer addressed emotional_complexity feedback
    across revisions. Critique 1 (0.50) identified lack of genuine humor before pathos;
    Critique 2 (0.78) praised the Breakfast joke but noted abrupt transitions; Critique
    3 (0.85) validated the humor-pathos balance. Final output strengthens the Breakfast
    joke setup with Luis''s genuine laugh (addressing Critique 1''s ''tell vs. show''
    problem) and extends the emotional arc with Maya''s intervention, creating smoother
    transitions. However, the writer didn''t fully resolve the ''almost breaks but
    covers with a joke'' beat—Marcus''s near-breakdown is present but the recovery
    joke (''You know what else is funny?'') feels slightly forced rather than seamlessly
    integrated.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0→V1 shows minimal change (identical opening). V1→V2
    upgrades ''wand'' to ''conductor''s baton'' and adds ''precision of someone who''d
    done this a thousand times''—stronger specificity. V2→V3 appears identical. Final
    output expands significantly with Maya''s arrival and theme articulation, but
    this expansion wasn''t captured in the version progression shown. The trajectory
    demonstrates incremental craft improvement (metaphor refinement) but the major
    structural improvements appear to have happened outside the tracked revisions.


    PRESERVATION: Strengths preserved excellently: (1) The Breakfast joke remains
    the emotional anchor; (2) Writers'' room authenticity maintained throughout (whiteboard
    markers, network notes, pilot season references); (3) Marcus''s voice stays consistent—smooth,
    practiced, hollow; (4) The coffee stain ending is preserved and strengthened.
    Minor loss: The opening''s ''sticky notes fluttering like nervous birds'' metaphor
    is strong but doesn''t evolve.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4/5):

    1. ✓ Marcus makes us laugh before sadness revealed: ''I feel like a therapy dog
    named Breakfast'' lands as humor; Luis''s genuine laugh confirms it. Then Maya''s
    observation (''It''s about someone who can''t say I''m sad without making it a
    menu item'') reveals the sadness beneath.

    2. ✓ Theme stated by minor character: Maya explicitly articulates the theme—the
    setup/expectation/twist structure mirrors emotional avoidance. Priya also reinforces
    it.

    3. ✓ Comedy craft specificity: ''Setup, Expectation, Twist. Rule of three, circled
    twice'' shows technical knowledge. The Breakfast joke demonstrates three-beat
    structure in action.

    4. ✗ New writer sees through Marcus: Maya does this well (''It''s not about the
    dog''), BUT the constraint requires the new writer to be ''not naive''—Maya''s
    perception is sharp, but her character development is thin. She appears primarily
    as a plot device for revelation rather than a fully realized character with her
    own complexity.

    5. ✓ Marcus almost breaks but covers with joke: ''The marker slipped from his
    fingers and clattered to the floor'' + ''his eyes were bright with something that
    might have been tears'' shows the break. Recovery: ''You know what else is funny?''
    attempts the cover, though execution is slightly awkward.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Save the Cat structure is present but loose:

    - Opening Image: Writers'' room panic ✓

    - Inciting Incident: Maya arrives and challenges the framework ✓

    - B-Story: Maya as emotional mirror (underdeveloped)

    - Midpoint: ''It''s about someone who can''t say I''m sad without making it a
    menu item'' ✓

    - Dark Night: Marcus''s near-breakdown ✓

    - Final Image: Coffee stain blooming, Marcus''s real laugh ✓

    Weakness: The B-story between Marcus and Maya lacks development. Their dynamic
    shifts from antagonistic to collaborative without intermediate scenes showing
    the relationship deepen.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong voice, authentic setting, effective emotional arc. The
    Breakfast joke is genuinely clever and serves multiple functions (humor, theme
    vehicle, character revelation). The ending lands with poetic resonance (coffee
    stain as metaphor). Weaknesses: (1) Maya feels somewhat archetypal (''wise newcomer
    reveals truth''); (2) The transition from Marcus''s breakdown to his ''real laugh''
    happens too quickly—the emotional stakes aren''t fully earned; (3) Priya''s role
    diminishes midway through; (4) The spec script reference (''I wrote a spec about
    a guy who can''t laugh anymore'') is powerful but introduced late and not fully
    integrated into the emotional logic.'
