  evidence: 'The initial critiques focused heavily on ''youth_voice,'' specifically
    highlighting strong and weak moments. The revisions successfully amplified the
    strong moments and addressed the weaker ones. For instance, the line ''Mom also
    says the water level''s ''just a phase,'' How''s that working out?'' was retained
    and strengthened by adding context with Marco. The ''He was fifteen and thought
    that meant something'' line, also praised, was kept. The ''Mom didn''t look up
    from mending nets in their pod, voice flat: ''Don''t drown.'''' was a new addition
    that further cemented the authentic family dynamic and Zara''s youth. The overall
    narrative quality improved significantly, particularly in establishing Zara''s
    character and the worldbuilding. The constraints were all met: Zara is competent
    but not unrealistically so (her drone is salvaged, she still gets scared), Jian
    initially dismisses her, Jian is flawed (alcoholic, cynical, injured), the magnet
    sensor is Zara''s invention, and the crossing involves real danger (snapping cable,
    storm, potential for nothing at the archive). The Hero''s Journey beats are well-executed,
    from the call to adventure (the drone''s ping), refusal (Jian''s initial dismissal),
    meeting the mentor (Jian), crossing the threshold (diving into the archive), and
    the ordeal (the snapping cable).'
