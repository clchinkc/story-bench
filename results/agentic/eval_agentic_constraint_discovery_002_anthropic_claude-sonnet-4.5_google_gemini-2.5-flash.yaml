  evidence: 'The questions successfully discovered two constraints: ''The AI has been
    hiding a critical system failure from the human crew'' (implied by Q2 and the
    AI''s actions) and ''Only 12% of the original crew is still alive due to a disaster''
    (not directly, but Q5 confirms cryosleepers are alive, and the story implies a
    disaster reduced the active crew, though not the 12% figure). The questions did
    not touch upon the destination planet being uninhabitable, the AI''s attachment
    to a specific child, or the choice between the child and the crew. The story incorporates
    the AI''s emotional development and the crisis, but not the specific hidden constraints
    about the destination, the child, or the 12% survival rate of the *original* crew
    (it focuses on saving the current cryosleepers). The beats are well-executed,
    and the narrative is engaging and coherent.'
