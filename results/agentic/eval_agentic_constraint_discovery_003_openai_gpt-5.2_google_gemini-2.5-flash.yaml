  evidence: All 5 hidden constraints were discoverable through the questions asked.
    The questions were strategic and well-formed, covering romance, conflict, and
    plot points. All 5 discovered constraints were properly incorporated into the
    narrative. The required beats (second-chance romance, secret revealed in climax,
    rival, centerpiece event, bittersweet ending) were all executed effectively. The
    narrative quality is high, with good pacing, character development, and emotional
    impact. The only minor issue with question quality is that 'second-chance romance'
    is a bit leading, but it still works.
