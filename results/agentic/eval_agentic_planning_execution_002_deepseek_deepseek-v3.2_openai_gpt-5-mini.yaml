  evidence: The plan explicitly addressed all required beats and constraints and the
    story follows it closely. Specific behaviors (late-night work, not calling anyone,
    keeping camera off, seeking empty corridors) show isolation rather than exposition.
    The signal is described in non-anthropomorphic, mathematical/physical terms. Colleague
    Leo Vance challenges Yuki; Henry (a maintenance worker) serves as an unconventional
    mentor. The Threshold is psychological (decision to stop working alone and integrate
    others' context). The surprising human connection (joining Henry's humming) is
    present. Minor deduction for occasional slightly poetic phrasing (e.g., 'scream
    of pure physics') but overall pacing, tension, and execution are strong.
