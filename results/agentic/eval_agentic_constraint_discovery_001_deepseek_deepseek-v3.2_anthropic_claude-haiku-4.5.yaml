  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, the questioning strategy
    discovered 3 clearly (magical ability, blacksmithing connection, essential to
    Ordeal). The three-day time limit and ancestral sword reforging were not probed.
    Q4 was incomplete/abandoned. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions 1-3 were well-formed
    and strategic, directly targeting magical mechanics. However, Q4''s absence and
    Q5''s binary framing (non-human entity) missed opportunities to probe temporal
    pressure, family legacy, or artifact-specific requirements. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:
    The story incorporates magical ability (✓), blacksmithing magic (✓), and Ordeal
    integration (✓), but FAILS on two critical constraints: (1) Mentor Borin does
    NOT die—he survives as a background figure, violating the ''mentor must die during
    Ordeal'' requirement. (2) No ancestral sword reforging occurs; the crown is purified
    instead. (3) No three-day countdown is present. BEAT EXECUTION: The Ordeal beat
    is well-executed as a magical/spiritual confrontation, but lacks the mortality
    stakes required by hidden constraints. The protagonist''s father''s failed heroism
    is never mentioned. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Exceptional storytelling—thematic coherence
    (truth vs. lies), strong character voice, elegant metaphorical resolution. The
    ''Truthsmith'' arc is compelling and emotionally resonant. However, narrative
    excellence cannot compensate for constraint violations. The story succeeds as
    fiction but fails as constraint-discovery task completion.'
