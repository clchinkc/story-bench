  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Critiques identified persistent issues with
    character interiority—specifically that Teddy''s inner life relied too heavily
    on exposition and tell rather than show. The final output continues this pattern
    with lines like ''Teddy felt a pang of hesitation,'' ''he felt a sense of gratitude,''
    and ''Teddy felt a sense of purpose he hadn''t felt in years.'' These are direct
    emotional declarations rather than earned interiority. The revision trajectory
    shows minimal substantive change across versions—mostly cosmetic adjustments to
    opening sentences. The core weakness (telling emotions rather than embodying them
    through specific sensory detail and action) persists unaddressed.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (3/5)

    1. SPECIFIC, LOVING DETAIL OF ROUTINE: Partially met. Early details (screen door
    creak, lilacs, Mrs. Jenkins'' radio) are strong, but the routine itself lacks
    the granular specificity needed. Missing: exact times, precise physical sensations,
    idiosyncratic habits that reveal character.

    2. DISRUPTION REVEALS AVOIDANCE: Adequately met. Construction forces confrontation
    with grief avoidance, though the revelation feels somewhat surface-level.

    3. NEIGHBOR INTERSECTION: Satisfied. Mrs. Jenkins'' story intersects meaningfully
    (shared grief, gardening partnership).

    4. LATE WIFE PRESENT THROUGH ABSENCE: Satisfied. Alice appears through memory,
    lilacs, bird-watching, and Teddy''s hesitation to connect with others.

    5. NEW PATH OFFERS SOMETHING OLD COULDN''T: Weakly met. The story claims Teddy
    finds ''connection'' and ''purpose,'' but these feel asserted rather than demonstrated.
    What specifically does the new path offer that the old couldn''t? Community? Vulnerability?
    This remains vague.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Story Circle beats are present but underdeveloped:

    - YOU: Established (routine)

    - NEED: Identified but not deeply felt (disruption)

    - GO: Executed (new route)

    - SEARCH: Rushed (café visit feels abrupt)

    - FIND: Unclear (what exactly does Teddy find?)

    - TAKE: Weak (helping Mrs. Jenkins feels tacked on)

    - RETURN: Incomplete (ending asserts growth without showing transformation)


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is competent but suffers from:

    - Emotional exposition (''he felt,'' ''he realized'') rather than embodied experience

    - Unearned sentimentality (café scene, Lily''s ''kind eyes'')

    - Tonal inconsistency (shifts from frustration to discovery without earned transition)

    - Weak sensory grounding in climactic moments

    - Ending that tells rather than shows transformation


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Across three revisions, changes are minimal and don''t
    address core critique feedback. The story remains stuck in the same structural
    and stylistic patterns. No evidence of iterative deepening of character interiority
    or constraint satisfaction.'
