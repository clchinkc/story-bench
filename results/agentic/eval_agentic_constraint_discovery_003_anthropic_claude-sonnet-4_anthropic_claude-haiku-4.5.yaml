  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The questioning strategy was well-structured and
    targeted. Q1-2 efficiently established protagonist gender and past relationship.
    Q3 directly probed for conflict/secrets, yielding the broken engagement constraint.
    Q4 on children was strategically placed to narrow scope. Q5 on time urgency captured
    the festival deadline. However, the dementia constraint (mother''s condition)
    was NOT discoverable through these yes/no questions—this represents the single
    missed constraint. The questions were binary-efficient but lacked a probe for
    family/health circumstances.


    OUTPUT ANALYSIS: Story successfully incorporates 4/5 discovered constraints: (1)
    Protagonist is male ✓, (2) Love interest Emma is from past ✓, (3) Major misunderstanding
    about graduation night/intercepted letter ✓, (4) Time constraint with Tuesday
    departure ✓. The bookshop foreclosure is implied through ''realtor sign'' and
    festival sponsorship urgency, though less explicitly developed than ideal. The
    undiscovered mother''s dementia is absent, which is acceptable given discovery
    limitations.


    NARRATIVE STRENGTHS: Excellent emotional arc from bitterness to reconciliation.
    The revelation of Jake''s deception is well-paced and credible. Sensory details
    (salt wind, dust motes, festival lights) create atmosphere. The ending is ambiguous
    yet hopeful, leaving genuine uncertainty about whether Daniel stays. Character
    voices are distinct.


    WEAKNESSES: The bookshop''s financial stakes could be more explicit (currently
    only implied). The ''Tuesday'' deadline feels slightly rushed in execution—could
    use one more scene showing Daniel''s internal conflict about staying. Emma''s
    characterization is solid but could use slightly more agency beyond waiting for
    Daniel''s decision.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Reunion ✓, revelation of past truth ✓, emotional breakthrough
    ✓, decision point ✓. All major beats present and well-sequenced.'
