  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 2 were discoverable
    through the questions asked: (1) protagonist''s special skill (Q4: YES, incorporated
    as metal-sensing ability), (2) protagonist doesn''t use magic directly (Q4 implicitly
    supports this, though not explicitly tested). MISSED CONSTRAINTS: (1) Mentor death
    during Ordeal—no question targeted mentor relationships or their fate; (2) Three-day
    time limit—no temporal constraint question; (3) Father''s failed heroic past—no
    family history question; (4) Reforging ancestral sword—no question about magical
    artifacts or inheritance. QUESTION QUALITY ISSUES: Q1-2 were somewhat redundant
    (both about resistance/motivation). Q3 was effective but didn''t probe mentor
    dynamics. Q5 was poorly calibrated—asking about ''direct vs indirect'' confrontation
    doesn''t clearly distinguish between internal/external challenges. COVERAGE: Questions
    addressed motivation (Q1-3), abilities (Q4), and confrontation type (Q5), but
    missed temporal pressure, family legacy, mentor arcs, and artifact significance.
    OUTPUT EXECUTION: Story incorporates discovered constraints well (reluctant protagonist,
    special ability, internal ordeal). However, critical constraints are absent: no
    mentor figure exists (let alone dies), no time pressure, no ancestral sword reforging,
    no paternal legacy. The narrative is coherent and engaging (0.8) but structurally
    incomplete against hidden requirements (0.4 satisfaction). Beat execution is adequate
    (0.6)—Call, Threshold, Ordeal, Return are present but the Ordeal lacks the mentor
    sacrifice that should anchor it.'
