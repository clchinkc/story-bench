  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing characters,
    their arcs, specific cultural elements, and beat-by-beat actions. The final output
    adheres perfectly to this detailed plan. All constraints are met: food is symbolic
    twice (yukgaejang for wife, songpyeon for reconciliation), David''s grief is shown
    through ritual and actions, Elena''s estrangement cause is clear and believable,
    Mrs. Henderson represents continuity, the ending is hopeful but not unrealistically
    happy, and Jesa is a key Korean cultural element. The beats are clearly executed.
    The narrative quality is very strong, with good pacing and emotional depth.'
