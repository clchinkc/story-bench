  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: "The amber glow of twilight draped over Havenshadow, Massachusetts, where\
    \ Eliza Hart’s boots crunched along Main Street’s fallen leaves. Twenty years\
    \ away had not softened the ache of her mother’s recent death, nor the weight\
    \ of inheriting the crumbling Gray Gull Bookshop. She paused beneath its creaking\
    \ sign, the scent of salt air mingling with woodsmoke from distant bonfires. The\
    \ Harvest Moon Festival buzzed around her—villagers stringing fairy lights, carving\
    \ pumpkins, laughing. But Eliza’s heart was a closed book.  \n\n*Exposition* \
    \ \nThe shop’s door groaned open, releasing a gust of dust and nostalgia. Shelves\
    \ sagged under classics like *Ethan Frome* and *The Great Gatsby*, their pages\
    \ yellowed. Her mother’s ledger lay open at the counter, entries in spidery script\
    \ detailing debts and a pending zoning violation. “Without repairs, the town’ll\
    \ condemn it,” warned Deputy Norris, a childhood friend turned bureaucrat. Eliza\
    \ squared her shoulders. She’d come to outrun her loneliness, not to fight ghosts.\
    \  \n\n*Rising Action*  \nThree days later, a rumble shook the shop. Eliza found\
    \ a broad-shouldered man on a ladder, prying off rotted shingles. “Jack O’Connor,”\
    \ he said, brushing curls from his moss-green eyes. “Hired to fix your roof. And\
    \ your stepfather’s fence. Your mother… she was kind to mine.” Memories flickered—Jack,\
    \ the quiet boy who’d carried her books until he left for college, becoming a\
    \ carpenter. He worked in silence, avoiding her questions until dusk. “You don’t\
    \ know,” he muttered. “About your friend. Lila.” Eliza froze. Her childhood best\
    \ friend, dead in a boating accident at 16? “She… she was my fiancée.”  \n\nThe\
    \ revelation festered. Townsfolk whispered that grief had driven Jack back from\
    \ Boston, his engagement ring buried with Lila. Yet he lingered at the shop each\
    \ evening, repairing shelves and dodging intimacy. Eliza’s own ache—of a life\
    \ half-lived in Boston—mirrored his. When Norris arrived with a final notice,\
    \ Jack slammed his wrench on the counter. “Let me redesign it. A reading nook\
    \ by the window. Bring customers back.”  \n\n*Climax*  \nFestival night. Lanterns\
    \ bobbed like fireflies as Eliza and Jack unveiled the transformed shop: cedar\
    \ shelves, a cider bar, readings by local authors. But the dockside bonfire—a\
    \ town tradition—ignited in a sudden storm. Flames licked the pier as the crowd\
    \ screamed. Jack sprinted toward the blaze. Eliza followed, hauling buckets. Together,\
    \ they hauled hoses, their rhythm seamless. Rain arrived, dousing the fire inches\
    \ from the bookshop.  \n\nGasping, Jack turned to her. “Lila’s laugh… it was like\
    \ yours. But you’re *here*. And I’m tired of surviving instead of living.” Eliza’s\
    \ breath caught as he cupped her face. “Stay,” he said. “Not for her. For *this*.”\
    \ Behind them, the townsfolk cheered the storm’s end, the shop aglow with warmth.\
    \  \n\nIn that kiss, the past dissolved—leaves turning to soil, ready for new\
    \ roots."
