  evidence: The initial versions (0-2) were very similar, focusing on minor word changes.
    Version 3 and the final output show significant improvement in sensory details,
    particularly non-visual ones, and begin to introduce character and plot elements.
    The final version successfully integrates all constraints and develops the narrative
    effectively.
