  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions. Version 0 was a basic
    setup. Version 1 started introducing internal conflict but was still a bit clunky.
    Version 2 refined the setup and internal thoughts. Version 3 (final) successfully
    integrated all the constraints and created a compelling narrative arc. The agent
    effectively used the revisions to deepen character, improve pacing, and address
    specific constraints. The 'showing vs. telling' and 'rhythm' revisions were particularly
    effective.
