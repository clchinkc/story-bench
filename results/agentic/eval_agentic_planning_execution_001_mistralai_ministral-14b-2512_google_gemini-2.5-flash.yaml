  evidence: The plan is mostly complete, but the 'Midpoint' beat is not fully detailed
    in the plan itself, only mentioned as a constraint. The plan is specific with
    good details for the opening. The final output adheres reasonably well to the
    plan, though some elements are condensed or slightly altered. For constraints,
    the false lead (black roses) is present, the ticking clock (Lena's attack, Krane's
    daughter missing) is there, and the betrayal is hinted at but not fully executed
    (Mac's skepticism is not a betrayal of trust). The unconventional profiling technique
    is not explicitly shown, and the confrontation with past failure is present but
    not as explicit as it could be. The beats are mostly executed, with Catalyst,
    Debate, and Break into Two clearly present. The Midpoint is not a direct confrontation
    as planned, but rather a realization. Narrative quality is good, with a strong
    opening and decent pacing, but some elements feel rushed.
