  evidence: The initial versions were very short and only established Elena's competence.
    Version 3 started to introduce the 'flaw' and the final output successfully developed
    the narrative to address all constraints. The core description of Elena's competence
    was preserved and expanded upon. The feedback was implicitly addressed through
    the iterative process of adding more story elements to meet the constraints. The
    only constraint not fully met was the 'specific medical detail that serves the
    story' as the use of epinephrine is a common and expected treatment, not particularly
    specific or unique to the narrative beyond being a plot device to show Elena's
    competence again.
