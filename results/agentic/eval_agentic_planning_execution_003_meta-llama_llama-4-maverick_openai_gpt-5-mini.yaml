  evidence: 'Satisfied: (1) Food used symbolically at least twice — scent evoking
    Young-mi and passing recipes/traditions; (3) Daughter''s estrangement has a specific
    cause (argument after Young-mi''s death; Sophia felt abandoned by his grief);
    (4) Regular customer (Mr. Choi) represents shared loss/comfort to David; (5) Ending
    is hopeful but restrained (new restaurant, legacy continued). Not satisfied: (2)
    David''s grief was explicitly named in the text (''David''s grief, though unspoken''),
    violating requirement that it remain present but unstated; (6) No clear Korean
    cultural element beyond food (names/dishes present but no extra cultural element
    such as language rituals, holidays, ancestral rites, objects, or practices). Beats:
    Setup (intro, ordinary world), Confrontation (estrangement, struggle, flashbacks),
    Resolution (demolition and new beginning) are all present. Overall story is coherent
    and emotionally grounded but leans on explicit statements and familiar beats,
    reducing subtlety.'
