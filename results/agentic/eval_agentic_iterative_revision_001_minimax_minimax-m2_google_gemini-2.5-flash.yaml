  evidence: The initial versions were very short, only setting up Elena's competence.
    The subsequent revisions built out the narrative significantly, introducing the
    conflict, the friendship, the medical detail, and the internal transformation.
    The quality improved dramatically from V0 to the final output. The core description
    of Elena's competence was preserved and expanded upon. Most constraints were addressed,
    though the 'genuine and earned' friendship felt a little rushed given the short
    timeframe of the story.
