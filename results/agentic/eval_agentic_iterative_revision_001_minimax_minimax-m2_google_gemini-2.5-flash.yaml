  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions, especially with the
    addition of the 'Her competence was a shield...' paragraph, which directly addressed
    the prompt's implicit need to transition from competence to flaw. The initial
    versions were very short and only established competence. The final version successfully
    integrated all the requested elements. The only constraint not fully met was the
    'internal transformation' as the external event of the health fair and Aisha's
    presence felt like the primary drivers, rather than Elena's own internal shift
    leading to those interactions. However, the ending ambiguity does hint at an internal
    struggle.
