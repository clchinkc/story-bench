  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing scenes, character
    behaviors, and even dialogue snippets. The final output adheres perfectly to the
    plan. All constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through specific behaviors
    (noise-cancelling headphones, text-only communication, ignoring family, eating
    alone, correcting others then withdrawing). The alien signal is genuinely alien
    (nested clusters, non-Euclidean, polarization flips, not optimal compression but
    ''conversation''). Amara challenges Yuki''s approach (''romantic,'' ''optimization,''
    ''sanity-check''). Hermes is an unconventional mentor (AI, ''pattern-morphizing'').
    The Threshold is psychological (Yuki''s internal struggle with leaving her isolation
    and engaging with ''people''). The moment of human connection is when Amara brings
    her tea and expresses vulnerability. All beats are present: Call to Adventure
    (the signal and the director''s order), Refusal of the Call (Yuki''s desire to
    work remotely, her internal debate), Meeting the Mentor (Hermes), Crossing the
    Threshold (Yuki''s arrival at the Antarctic facility and her initial interactions).
    The narrative quality is very high, with strong pacing and character development.'
