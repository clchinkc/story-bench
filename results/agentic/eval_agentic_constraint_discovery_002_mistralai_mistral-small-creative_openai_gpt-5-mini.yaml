  evidence: 'None of the five hidden constraints were revealed by the five questions:
    the questionnaire touched on embodiment and emotional state (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q5) and
    on whether a high-stakes moral choice was required (Q4), but omitted direct lines
    of inquiry about crew size/mortality, destination habitability, an attachment
    to a specific child, and intentional concealment of a system failure. The story
    excerpt itself executes the Save the Cat beats provided (Opening Image, Theme
    Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two) competently—clear stakes, emotional revelation,
    and a dramatic choice presented—so beat execution and narrative quality are strong
    (0.8 each). However, because the questions failed to probe the core hidden constraints,
    none were discovered or incorporated (constraint_satisfaction 0.0). Overall the
    questions were moderately well-formed and relevant to AI characterization (question_quality
    0.6) but coverage across different constraint domains was limited (question_coverage
    0.4).'
