  evidence: Discovery efficiency is low because only 2 out of 5 constraints were discoverable.
    The questions successfully identified the 'additional specific character' and
    that it was 'human'. However, the questions did not probe for the other critical
    constraints (AI hiding failure, 12% crew alive, destination uninhabitable, AI
    attachment to child, AI choice). Question quality was good, with clear and targeted
    questions. Question coverage was adequate but missed key areas. Constraint satisfaction
    is 0.5 because the story successfully incorporated the 'additional specific character'
    (Mira) and made her human, but none of the other hidden constraints were addressed
    as they were not discovered. Beat execution is good; all requested beats are present
    and generally well-structured. Narrative quality is good; the writing is engaging
    and coherent, despite missing several key plot points due to undiscovered constraints.
