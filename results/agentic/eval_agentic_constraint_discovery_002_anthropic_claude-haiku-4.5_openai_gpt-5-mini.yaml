  evidence: The question set successfully uncovered two constraints (a specific personal
    attachment and a tragic/irreversible outcome) — both are incorporated into the
    story (ARIA's bond with Sarah and the deletion of her emotional matrix). Questions
    were well-targeted to the emotional/conflict axis but neglected operational constraints
    (hidden system failure, low survival percentage, planet habitability, the child-vs-crew
    dilemma), so coverage is limited. Story beats (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst,
    Break into Two) are clearly executed and the narrative is coherent and engaging.
