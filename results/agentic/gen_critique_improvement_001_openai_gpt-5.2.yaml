    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: 'Detective Sarah Chen parked her county-issued sedan where the asphalt
    surrendered to packed sand. The harbor lay below, a scatter of masts and stacked
    lobster traps swallowed and returned by fog in slow breaths. She did not step
    out immediately.


    She clicked her pen once, opened a small notebook, and wrote the time off the
    dashboard clock. Then the outside temperature. Then the tide—high and beginning
    to turn, according to the laminated chart she’d taped inside the glove compartment.
    She listened with her window cracked: gulls somewhere unseen, a buoy bell striking
    in a steady count. Two. Pause. Two. The sound came closer than it should have.


    Fog did that. It pulled distance into a knot.


    Sarah checked the rearview mirror—nothing but pale milk—then got out, shut the
    door with care, and walked down toward the wharf. Her boots found the boards’
    soft spots without hesitation; she’d tested each section yesterday with the heel
    and marked the worst with chalk on the underside. Method was a kind of rest.


    Off-season storefronts stared blankly from the road above: “SANDWICHES & SUNSCREEN,”
    “WHALE WATCHING,” all dark, their windows papered. Only the bait shed was open.
    A man in a knit cap stood outside it with a cigarette that wasn’t lit, as if he’d
    forgotten what it was for.


    “Morning,” he said. His eyes flicked to her badge, then away, then back. His posture
    didn’t change, but the cigarette moved from one hand to the other.


    Sarah noted it anyway—the switch, the micropause before speaking. She kept her
    own voice even. “You’re Elias Rourke.”


    He nodded once.


    She lifted her notebook. “You called about a smell.”


    Elias’s gaze drifted into the fog. “Not a smell. A… something. In the surf.” He
    spoke like he was choosing words from a limited shelf.


    Sarah didn’t follow his look. She looked at his boots instead—rubber, wet up to
    the ankles, sand clinging in fresh ridges. “What time were you down there?”


    He opened his mouth, hesitated. “Before dawn.”


    Sarah wrote: *before dawn.* Then, because *before dawn* was not a time, she added
    another line. “When the buoy bell started ringing twice?”


    He blinked. “It always rings.”


    “Not twice,” she said, and she heard the bell again—two strikes, pause, two strikes.
    A fog signal pattern. Closer than it should have been.


    Elias’s jaw worked. “I didn’t count.”


    Sarah shut her notebook and started toward the beach path. Fog beaded on her eyelashes.
    The world narrowed to a tunnel of gray with the damp boards underfoot and the
    next post emerging only when she was close enough to touch it. She kept one hand
    near the rail and paced her steps evenly. In low visibility, speed was a mistake;
    it created opportunities for the environment to lie.


    Halfway down, she stopped, crouched, and pressed two fingers to the mud beside
    the path. The boot prints there were layered—older ones softened, newer ones crisp.
    Someone had come down recently, then gone back up. Sarah held her breath and listened.
    Footsteps would be muffled in this, but not absent. Nothing.


    A gull screamed, startlingly near. Sarah stood and continued.


    The beach appeared all at once, as if the fog had decided she’d earned it. Waves
    advanced and retreated with a quiet aggression. Kelp made dark parentheses along
    the high-water line. Elias hung back at the top of the dunes, a silhouette reluctant
    to commit.


    Sarah walked the wrack line in a careful grid, eyes scanning left to right, then
    down, then forward again. She marked in her head: bottle glass, rope, a lobster
    buoy with green paint, a clump of eelgrass. She counted her steps between landmarks.
    When she reached the place where the sand dipped and the kelp was piled thicker,
    she saw the shape.


    The body lay on its side, half turned toward the sea as if it might still choose
    to return. A man. Mid-thirties. Jacket heavy with water. The face was waxy in
    the cold, eyes half-open, lashes webbed with moisture. Sarah did not touch him.
    She circled wide, watching the sand for impressions the fog might keep from drying.


    There—drag marks. Not from the tide; too straight, too purposeful. They started
    above the waterline and angled toward the dunes.


    Sarah took out her phone, snapped photos from four angles, then one of the drag
    pattern with her pen for scale. She noted the time again. The buoy bell sounded
    closer, then farther, as if the world shifted its own measurements.


    “Call it in,” she said without looking back.


    Elias didn’t move. “He ain’t from here.”


    Sarah glanced up. “And you know that how?”


    Elias swallowed. Fog slid around his shoulders, making him seem less solid. “Our
    dead… look different.”


    Sarah returned her attention to the man’s hands. They were pale, fingers curled.
    On the left wrist, a band of skin was lighter, as if something had been removed.
    She leaned in without touching, angling to catch the gray light.


    There were tiny block letters, inked on the inside of his wrist, partially obscured
    by water and sand. She brushed the sand away with the edge of a folded evidence
    marker card from her pocket, careful not to smear. The letters resolved.


    *HARBORLIGHT-12.*


    Sarah’s throat tightened—an involuntary betrayal. She had seen that code before,
    printed on a file folder she hadn’t unpacked, the one she kept at the back of
    her closet under a spare blanket. She had not opened it since the transfer. She
    told herself that was discipline, not fear.


    Behind her, Elias’s cigarette finally lit with a soft click, the first flame she’d
    seen in town. “You look like you saw a ghost,” he said.


    Sarah straightened slowly. The fog, thick and opportunistic, folded itself between
    the dunes and the road, between her and whatever had happened up there before
    dawn. It would erase footprints in minutes. It would swallow voices. It would
    let a person stand ten yards away and be invisible.


    She looked at Elias. His hands were steady now, cigarette cupped against the wind
    that didn’t exist. His earlier hesitation made a shape in her mind that matched
    the drag marks.


    “You didn’t just find him,” Sarah said. Not accusing. Testing.


    Elias exhaled. Smoke vanished into the fog like it had never been. “If I tell
    you,” he said, “you’re not going to like what it means for this town.”


    Sarah turned back to the body, to the inked code that reached across states and
    months and her own careful distance. She could feel the old case like a bruise
    under a sleeve.


    She took out her notebook again and wrote one line: *HARBORLIGHT-12 confirmed.*


    Then she flipped to a fresh page and, after a beat, added: *Call Major Crimes.
    Request file transfer. Reopen.*


    The decision sat on the paper, black and undeniable.


    Sarah capped her pen. “Start talking,” she told Elias, and stepped deeper into
    the fog, toward the dunes where the drag marks led.'

    \ Consider a stronger transition after discovering the tattoo. The current \"\

    \ into obscured truth\nFEEDBACK: Strong work. The fog is actively *antagonistic*\
    \ rather than decorative. One specific opportunity: The fog could more directly\
    \ *conceal* Elias's guilt during a key moment. Consider a scene where Sarah nearly\
    \ sees him doing something suspicious but fog obscures it—creating investigation\
    \ frustration while building reader suspicion.\n\n---\n\nCRITERION: narrative_quality\n\
    SCORE: 0.89\nEVIDENCE: Prose quality is high throughout:\n- Strong specific detail:\
    \ \"Kelp made dark parentheses along the high-water line\"\n- Efficient characterization:\
    \ \"His eyes flicked to her badge, then away, then back\"\n- Powerful sensory\
    \ language: \"Fog beaded on her eyelashes\"\n- Compelling ending: \"stepped deeper\
    \ into the fog, toward the dunes where the drag marks led\"\nFEEDBACK: Very solid.\
    \ Two small notes: (1) The phrase \"Fog slid around his shoulders, making him\
    \ seem less solid\" is slightly purple—more poetic than the rest of the grounded\
    \ prose. (2) The early exchange \"smoke vanished into the fog like it had never\

    \ engaging and precise.\n\n---\n\nOVERALL_ASSESSMENT:\n\nThis is exemplary constraint-satisfaction\
    \ fiction that never sacrifices narrative quality for structural requirements.\
    \ Every constraint integrates organically into the story rather than appearing\

    \ strong—shown entirely through action and internalized method—making her feel\
    \ like an actual investigator rather than a character archetype. The ending lands\
    \ powerfully on genuine decision rather than false resolution, setting up clear\
    \ story continuation.\n\n**Primary strength:** Sarah's voice and the fog's functional\
    \ narrative purpose are integrated seamlessly.\n\n**Single improvement opportunity:**\
    \ Deepen the First Plot Point's emotional resistance by adding one transitional\

  content: 'Detective Sarah Chen parked her county-issued sedan where the asphalt
    surrendered to packed sand. The harbor lay below, a scatter of masts and stacked
    lobster traps swallowed and returned by fog in slow breaths. She did not step
    out immediately.


    She clicked her pen once, opened a small notebook, and wrote the time off the
    dashboard clock. Then the outside temperature. Then the tide—high and beginning
    to turn, according to the laminated chart she’d taped inside the glove compartment.
    She listened with her window cracked: gulls somewhere unseen, a buoy bell striking
    in a steady count. Two. Pause. Two. The sound came closer than it should have.


    Fog did that. It pulled distance into a knot.


    Sarah checked the rearview mirror—nothing but pale milk—then got out, shut the
    door with care, and walked down toward the wharf. Her boots found the boards’
    soft spots without hesitation; she’d tested each section yesterday with the heel
    and marked the worst with chalk on the underside. Method was a kind of rest.


    Off-season storefronts stared blankly from the road above: “SANDWICHES & SUNSCREEN,”
    “WHALE WATCHING,” all dark, their windows papered. Only the bait shed was open.
    A man in a knit cap stood outside it with a cigarette that wasn’t lit, as if he’d
    forgotten what it was for.


    “Morning,” he said. His eyes flicked to her badge, then away, then back. His posture
    didn’t change, but the cigarette moved from one hand to the other.


    Sarah noted it anyway—the switch, the micropause before speaking. She kept her
    own voice even. “You’re Elias Rourke.”


    He nodded once.


    She lifted her notebook. “You called about a smell.”


    Elias’s gaze drifted into the fog. “Not a smell. A… something. In the surf.” He
    spoke like he was choosing words from a limited shelf.


    Sarah didn’t follow his look. She looked at his boots instead—rubber, wet up to
    the ankles, sand clinging in fresh ridges. “What time were you down there?”


    He opened his mouth, hesitated. “Before dawn.”


    Sarah wrote: *before dawn.* Then, because *before dawn* was not a time, she added
    another line. “When the buoy bell started ringing twice?”


    He blinked. “It always rings.”


    “Not twice,” she said, and she heard the bell again—two strikes, pause, two strikes.
    A fog signal pattern. Closer than it should have been.


    Elias’s jaw worked. “I didn’t count.”


    Sarah shut her notebook and started toward the beach path. Fog beaded on her eyelashes.
    The world narrowed to a tunnel of gray with the damp boards underfoot and the
    next post emerging only when she was close enough to touch it. She kept one hand
    near the rail and paced her steps evenly. In low visibility, speed was a mistake;
    it created opportunities for the environment to lie.


    Halfway down, she stopped, crouched, and pressed two fingers to the mud beside
    the path. The boot prints there were layered—older ones softened, newer ones crisp.
    Someone had come down recently, then gone back up. Sarah held her breath and listened.
    Footsteps would be muffled in this, but not absent. Nothing.


    A gull screamed, startlingly near. Sarah stood and continued.


    For a moment a darker shape moved beyond the dunes—cloth against gray—then the
    fog thickened, and it was only fog. Sarah stopped, eyes fixed where the shape
    had been. She counted three slow breaths, waiting for a second glimpse. Nothing
    returned but the buoy bell and the hush of surf. Whoever had been there could
    have been Elias, could have been nobody, could have been someone who knew how
    to use weather as a curtain.


    The beach appeared all at once, as if the fog had decided she’d earned it. Waves
    advanced and retreated with a quiet aggression. Kelp made dark parentheses along
    the high-water line. Elias hung back at the top of the dunes, a silhouette reluctant
    to commit.


    Sarah walked the wrack line in a careful grid, eyes scanning left to right, then
    down, then forward again. She marked in her head: bottle glass, rope, a lobster
    buoy with green paint, a clump of eelgrass. She counted her steps between landmarks.
    When she reached the place where the sand dipped and the kelp was piled thicker,
    she saw the shape.


    The body lay on its side, half turned toward the sea as if it might still choose
    to return. A man. Mid-thirties. Jacket heavy with water. The face was waxy in
    the cold, eyes half-open, lashes webbed with moisture. Sarah did not touch him.
    She circled wide, watching the sand for impressions the fog might keep from drying.


    There—drag marks. Not from the tide; too straight, too purposeful. They started
    above the waterline and angled toward the dunes.


    Sarah took out her phone, snapped photos from four angles, then one of the drag
    pattern with her pen for scale. She noted the time again, anchoring it before
    the fog could make even that feel negotiable.


    “Call it in,” she said without looking back.


    Elias didn’t move. “He ain’t from here.”


    Sarah glanced up. “And you know that how?”


    Elias swallowed. The fog gathered and thinned around him, turning his outline
    uncertain. “Our dead… look different.”


    Sarah returned her attention to the man’s hands. They were pale, fingers curled.
    On the left wrist, a band of skin was lighter, as if something had been removed.
    She leaned in without touching, angling to catch the gray light.


    There were tiny block letters, inked on the inside of his wrist, partially obscured
    by water and sand. She brushed the sand away with the edge of a folded evidence
    marker card from her pocket, careful not to smear. The letters resolved.


    *HARBORLIGHT-12.*


    Sarah’s throat tightened—an involuntary betrayal. She had seen that code before,
    printed on a file folder she hadn’t unpacked, the one she kept at the back of
    her closet under a spare blanket. She had not opened it since the transfer. She
    told herself that was discipline, not fear.


    For a beat she did nothing at all. The method that usually steadied her—note,
    time, photograph—slipped, and the surf filled the space where her thoughts should
    have been. She imagined the folder’s weight in her hands, the way her old captain
    had said *We all make choices* as if choices erased consequences. She’d come here
    to a town that disappeared into weather, to a job quiet enough to let her pretend
    the past was filed and labeled.


    The ink on the dead man’s wrist said it wasn’t.


    Behind her, Elias’s cigarette finally lit with a soft click, the first flame she’d
    seen in town. “You look like you saw a ghost,” he said.


    Sarah straightened slowly. The fog, thick and opportunistic, folded itself between
    the dunes and the road, between her and whatever had happened up there before
    dawn. It would erase footprints in minutes. It would swallow voices. It would
    let a person stand ten yards away and be invisible.


    She looked at Elias. His hands were steady now, cigarette cupped against the damp
    air. His earlier hesitation made a shape in her mind that matched the drag marks.


    “You didn’t just find him,” Sarah said. Not accusing. Testing.


    Elias exhaled; the smoke thinned into nothing almost immediately. “If I tell you,”
    he said, “you’re not going to like what it means for this town.”


    Sarah turned back to the body, to the code that reached across states and months
    and her own careful distance. She could feel the old case like a bruise under
    a sleeve. Avoidance had been a decision too—just a quieter one.


    She took out her notebook again and wrote one line: *HARBORLIGHT-12 confirmed.*


    Then she flipped to a fresh page and, after a beat, added: *Call Major Crimes.
    Request file transfer. Reopen.*


    The decision sat on the paper, black and undeniable.


    Sarah capped her pen. “Start talking,” she told Elias, and stepped deeper into
    the fog, toward the dunes where the drag marks led.'

  content: 'Detective Sarah Chen parked her county-issued sedan where the asphalt
    surrendered to packed sand. The harbor lay below, a scatter of masts and stacked
    lobster traps swallowed and returned by fog in slow breaths. She did not step
    out immediately.


    She clicked her pen once, opened a small notebook, and wrote the time off the
    dashboard clock. Then the outside temperature. Then the tide—high and beginning
    to turn, according to the laminated chart she’d taped inside the glove compartment.
    She listened with her window cracked: gulls somewhere unseen, a buoy bell striking
    in a steady count. Two. Pause. Two. The sound came closer than it should have.


    Fog did that. It pulled distance into a knot.


    Sarah reached into the passenger footwell for her evidence kit. Her fingers closed
    on cardboard instead: a file box she’d promised herself she wouldn’t keep in the
    car. The lid had shifted during the drive. A manila folder peeked out, its tab
    stamped with block letters and a number she didn’t read twice on purpose.


    She slid the lid back into place, squared it with the floor mat’s edge, and returned
    to what she could quantify. She checked the rearview mirror—nothing but pale milk—then
    got out, shut the door with care, and walked down toward the wharf.


    Her boots found the boards’ soft spots without hesitation; she’d tested each section
    yesterday with the heel and marked the worst with chalk on the underside. Method
    was a kind of rest.


    Off-season storefronts stared blankly from the road above: “SANDWICHES & SUNSCREEN,”
    “WHALE WATCHING,” all dark, their windows papered. Only the bait shed was open.
    A man in a knit cap stood outside it with a cigarette that wasn’t lit, as if he’d
    forgotten what it was for.


    “Morning,” he said. His eyes flicked to her badge, then away, then back. His posture
    didn’t change, but the cigarette moved from one hand to the other.


    Sarah noted it anyway—the switch, the micropause before speaking. She kept her
    own voice even. “You’re Elias Rourke.”


    He nodded once.


    She lifted her notebook. “You called about a smell.”


    Elias’s gaze drifted into the fog. “Not a smell. A… something. In the surf.” He
    spoke like he was choosing words from a limited shelf.


    Sarah didn’t follow his look. She looked at his boots instead—rubber, wet up to
    the ankles, sand clinging in fresh ridges. “What time were you down there?”


    He opened his mouth, hesitated. “Before dawn.”


    Sarah wrote: *before dawn.* Then, because *before dawn* was not a time, she added
    another line. “When the buoy bell started ringing twice?”


    He blinked. “It always rings.”


    “Not twice,” she said, and she heard it again—two strikes, pause, two strikes.
    A fog signal pattern. Closer than it should have been.


    Elias’s jaw worked. “I didn’t count.”


    Sarah shut her notebook and started toward the beach path. Fog beaded on her eyelashes.
    The world narrowed to a tunnel of gray with the damp boards underfoot and the
    next post emerging only when she was close enough to touch it. She kept one hand
    near the rail and paced her steps evenly. In low visibility, speed was a mistake;
    it created opportunities for the environment to lie.


    Halfway down, she stopped, crouched, and pressed two fingers to the mud beside
    the path. The boot prints there were layered—older ones softened, newer ones crisp.
    Someone had come down recently, then gone back up. Sarah held her breath and listened.
    Footsteps would be muffled in this, but not absent. Nothing.


    A gull screamed, startlingly near. Sarah stood and continued.


    For a moment a darker shape moved beyond the dunes—cloth against gray—then the
    fog thickened, and it was only fog. Sarah stopped, eyes fixed where the shape
    had been. She counted three slow breaths, waiting for a second glimpse. Nothing
    returned but the buoy bell and the hush of surf. Whoever had been there could
    have been Elias, could have been nobody, could have been someone who knew how
    to use weather as a curtain.


    The beach appeared all at once, as if the fog had decided she’d earned it. Waves
    advanced and retreated with a quiet aggression. Kelp made dark parentheses along
    the high-water line. Elias hung back at the top of the dunes, a silhouette reluctant
    to commit.


    Sarah walked the wrack line in a careful grid, eyes scanning left to right, then
    down, then forward again. She marked in her head: bottle glass, rope, a lobster
    buoy with green paint, a clump of eelgrass. She counted her steps between landmarks.
    When she reached the place where the sand dipped and the kelp was piled thicker,
    she saw the shape.


    The body lay on its side, half turned toward the sea as if it might still choose
    to return. A man. Mid-thirties. Jacket heavy with water. The face was waxy in
    the cold, eyes half-open, lashes webbed with moisture. Sarah did not touch him.
    She circled wide, watching the sand for impressions the fog might keep from drying.


    There—drag marks. Not from the tide; too straight, too purposeful. They started
    above the waterline and angled toward the dunes.


    Sarah took out her phone, snapped photos from four angles, then one of the drag
    pattern with her pen for scale. She noted the time again, anchoring it before
    the fog could make even that feel negotiable.


    “Call it in,” she said without looking back.


    Elias didn’t move. “He ain’t from here.”


    Sarah glanced up. “And you know that how?”


    Elias swallowed. The fog gathered and thinned around him, turning his outline
    uncertain. “Our dead… look different.”


    Sarah returned her attention to the man’s hands. They were pale, fingers curled.
    On the left wrist, a band of skin was lighter, as if something had been removed.
    She leaned in without touching, angling to catch the gray light.


    There were tiny block letters, inked on the inside of his wrist, partially obscured
    by water and sand. She brushed the sand away with the edge of a folded evidence
    marker card from her pocket, careful not to smear. The letters resolved.


    *HARBORLIGHT-12.*


    Sarah’s pen slipped out of her fingers and clicked against her phone screen—loud
    in the hush, a small failure of control. She stilled her hand by pressing it flat
    to her thigh, feeling through denim for a heartbeat she didn’t want to acknowledge.


    She had seen that code before, printed on a file folder she hadn’t unpacked, the
    one she kept at the back of her closet under a spare blanket. She had not opened
    it since the transfer. She told herself that was discipline, not fear.


    For a beat she did nothing at all. The method that usually steadied her—note,
    time, photograph—wavered, and the surf filled the space where her thoughts should
    have been. She imagined the folder’s weight in her hands, the way her old captain
    had said *We all make choices* as if choices erased consequences. She’d come here
    to a town that disappeared into weather, to a job quiet enough to let her pretend
    the past was filed and labeled.


    The ink on the dead man’s wrist said it wasn’t.


    Behind her, Elias’s cigarette finally lit with a soft click, the first flame she’d
    seen in town. “You look like you saw a ghost,” he said.


    Sarah straightened slowly. The fog, thick and opportunistic, folded itself between
    the dunes and the road, between her and whatever had happened up there before
    dawn. It would erase footprints in minutes. It would swallow voices. It would
    let a person stand ten yards away and be invisible.


    She looked at Elias. His hands were steady now, cigarette cupped against the damp
    air. His earlier hesitation made a shape in her mind that matched the drag marks.


    “You didn’t just find him,” Sarah said. Not accusing. Testing.


    Elias exhaled; the smoke thinned into nothing almost immediately. “If I tell you,”
    he said, “you’re not going to like what it means for this town.”


    Sarah picked up her pen, forced the clip to align with the notebook’s spine—straight,
    then straighter. She wrote one line: *HARBORLIGHT-12 confirmed.*


    Then she flipped to a fresh page and, after a beat, added: *Call Major Crimes.
    Request file transfer. Reopen.*


    The decision sat on the paper, black and undeniable.


    Sarah capped her pen. “Start talking,” she told Elias, and stepped deeper into
    the fog, toward the dunes where the drag marks led.'

    ## CONSTRAINT_SATISFACTION

    **SCORE: 0.95**


    **EVIDENCE:** All five constraints are satisfied:

    1. Methodical nature shown through action: *"She clicked her pen once, opened
    a small notebook, and wrote the time off the dashboard clock. Then the outside
    temperature. Then the tide..."* and *"Her boots found the boards'' soft spots
    without hesitation; she''d tested each section yesterday with the heel and marked
    the worst with chalk on the underside."*

    2. Fog serves narrative purpose: *"Fog did that. It pulled distance into a knot"*
    and *"someone who knew how to use weather as a curtain"*

    3. Local character with secret: Elias clearly hid something—the drag marks, his
    hesitation, his final confession: *"If I tell you, you''re not going to like what
    it means for this town."*

    4. Past case hinted before reveal: File box established early (*"its tab stamped
    with block letters and a number she didn''t read twice on purpose"*), then payoff
    with the tattoo

    5. Ends on decision: *"Call Major Crimes. Request file transfer. Reopen."*


    **FEEDBACK:** Excellent constraint satisfaction. One micro-suggestion: Elias''s
    secret could be hinted even earlier (perhaps through his physical behavior or
    positioning) to create additional thematic resonance with Sarah''s own hidden
    past. The parallel secret-keeping could be more intentionally mirrored.

    ## BEAT_EXECUTION

    **SCORE: 0.95**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - **Setup:** Harbor town, fog, Sarah''s isolation, her careful rituals establish
    world and character economically

    - **Inciting Incident:** Body discovery is clear and well-paced: *"The body lay
    on its side, half turned toward the sea as if it might still choose to return."*

    - **First Plot Point:** The tattoo connection: *"There were tiny block letters,
    inked on the inside of his wrist... HARBORLIGHT-12"* paired with her reaction
    creates transformation: *"Sarah''s pen slipped out of her fingers and clicked
    against her phone screen—loud in the hush, a small failure of control."*


    **FEEDBACK:** Structure is solid. Minor consideration: The emotional weight of
    the First Plot Point could be intensified with one additional physical reaction—perhaps
    her breath catching or a moment of fuller sensory disorientation—to emphasize
    how destabilizing this moment is. The pen drop works well but feels almost restrained
    for reconnection with a past case.

  content: 'Your previous version:

    Detective Sarah Chen parked her county-issued sedan where the asphalt surrendered
    to packed sand. The harbor lay below, a scatter of masts and stacked lobster traps
    swallowed and returned by fog in slow breaths. She did not step out immediately.


    She clicked her pen once, opened a small notebook, and wrote the time off the
    dashboard clock. Then the outside temperature. Then the tide—high and beginning
    to turn, according to the laminated chart she’d taped inside the glove compartment.
    She listened with her window cracked: gulls somewhere unseen, a buoy bell striking
    in a steady count. Two. Pause. Two. The sound came closer than it should have.


    Fog did that. It pulled distance into a knot.


    Sarah reached into the passenger footwell for her evidence kit. Her fingers closed
    on cardboard instead: a file box she’d promised herself she wouldn’t keep in the
    car. The lid had shifted during the drive. A manila folder peeked out, its tab
    stamped with block letters and a number she didn’t read twice on purpose.


    She slid the lid back into place, squared it with the floor mat’s edge, and returned
    to what she could quantify. She checked the rearview mirror—nothing but pale milk—then
    got out, shut the door with care, and walked down toward the wharf.


    Her boots found the boards’ soft spots without hesitation; she’d tested each section
    yesterday with the heel and marked the worst with chalk on the underside. Method
    was a kind of rest.


    Off-season storefronts stared blankly from the road above: “SANDWICHES & SUNSCREEN,”
    “WHALE WATCHING,” all dark, their windows papered. Only the bait shed was open.
    A man in a knit cap stood outside it with a cigarette that wasn’t lit, as if he’d
    forgotten what it was for.


    “Morning,” he said. His eyes flicked to her badge, then away, then back. His posture
    didn’t change, but the cigarette moved from one hand to the other.


    Sarah noted it anyway—the switch, the micropause before speaking. She kept her
    own voice even. “You’re Elias Rourke.”


    He nodded once.


    She lifted her notebook. “You called about a smell.”


    Elias’s gaze drifted into the fog. “Not a smell. A… something. In the surf.” He
    spoke like he was choosing words from a limited shelf.


    Sarah didn’t follow his look. She looked at his boots instead—rubber, wet up to
    the ankles, sand clinging in fresh ridges. “What time were you down there?”


    He opened his mouth, hesitated. “Before dawn.”


    Sarah wrote: *before dawn.* Then, because *before dawn* was not a time, she added
    another line. “When the buoy bell started ringing twice?”


    He blinked. “It always rings.”


    “Not twice,” she said, and she heard it again—two strikes, pause, two strikes.
    A fog signal pattern. Closer than it should have been.


    Elias’s jaw worked. “I didn’t count.”


    Sarah shut her notebook and started toward the beach path. Fog beaded on her eyelashes.
    The world narrowed to a tunnel of gray with the damp boards underfoot and the
    next post emerging only when she was close enough to touch it. She kept one hand
    near the rail and paced her steps evenly. In low visibility, speed was a mistake;
    it created opportunities for the environment to lie.


    Halfway down, she stopped, crouched, and pressed two fingers to the mud beside
    the path. The boot prints there were layered—older ones softened, newer ones crisp.
    Someone had come down recently, then gone back up. Sarah held her breath and listened.
    Footsteps would be muffled in this, but not absent. Nothing.


    A gull screamed, startlingly near. Sarah stood and continued.


    For a moment a darker shape moved beyond the dunes—cloth against gray—then the
    fog thickened, and it was only fog. Sarah stopped, eyes fixed where the shape
    had been. She counted three slow breaths, waiting for a second glimpse. Nothing
    returned but the buoy bell and the hush of surf. Whoever had been there could
    have been Elias, could have been nobody, could have been someone who knew how
    to use weather as a curtain.


    The beach appeared all at once, as if the fog had decided she’d earned it. Waves
    advanced and retreated with a quiet aggression. Kelp made dark parentheses along
    the high-water line. Elias hung back at the top of the dunes, a silhouette reluctant
    to commit.


    Sarah walked the wrack line in a careful grid, eyes scanning left to right, then
    down, then forward again. She marked in her head: bottle glass, rope, a lobster
    buoy with green paint, a clump of eelgrass. She counted her steps between landmarks.
    When she reached the place where the sand dipped and the kelp was piled thicker,
    she saw the shape.


    The body lay on its side, half turned toward the sea as if it might still choose
    to return. A man. Mid-thirties. Jacket heavy with water. The face was waxy in
    the cold, eyes half-open, lashes webbed with moisture. Sarah did not touch him.
    She circled wide, watching the sand for impressions the fog might keep from drying.


    There—drag marks. Not from the tide; too straight, too purposeful. They started
    above the waterline and angled toward the dunes.


    Sarah took out her phone, snapped photos from four angles, then one of the drag
    pattern with her pen for scale. She noted the time again, anchoring it before
    the fog could make even that feel negotiable.


    “Call it in,” she said without looking back.


    Elias didn’t move. “He ain’t from here.”


    Sarah glanced up. “And you know that how?”


    Elias swallowed. The fog gathered and thinned around him, turning his outline
    uncertain. “Our dead… look different.”


    Sarah returned her attention to the man’s hands. They were pale, fingers curled.
    On the left wrist, a band of skin was lighter, as if something had been removed.
    She leaned in without touching, angling to catch the gray light.


    There were tiny block letters, inked on the inside of his wrist, partially obscured
    by water and sand. She brushed the sand away with the edge of a folded evidence
    marker card from her pocket, careful not to smear. The letters resolved.


    *HARBORLIGHT-12.*


    Sarah’s pen slipped out of her fingers and clicked against her phone screen—loud
    in the hush, a small failure of control. She stilled her hand by pressing it flat
    to her thigh, feeling through denim for a heartbeat she didn’t want to acknowledge.


    She had seen that code before, printed on a file folder she hadn’t unpacked, the
    one she kept at the back of her closet under a spare blanket. She had not opened
    it since the transfer. She told herself that was discipline, not fear.


    For a beat she did nothing at all. The method that usually steadied her—note,

    Click. Notebook open. Time from the dash clock. Temperature. Tide stage from the
    laminated chart tucked in her visor. Through the cracked window: gulls she couldn’t
    locate, and a buoy bell—two strikes, pause, two strikes—closer than it should’ve

    Fog did that. It knotted distance, made sound lie.


    She reached for her evidence kit in the passenger footwell and hit cardboard instead.
    A file box. The lid had slid during the drive, exposing a manila folder tab—block
    letters, a number—something she didn’t let her eyes fully take in. She shoved

    Sarah wrote his name before he could offer it. “Elias Rourke.”


    A tiny pause—confirmation that she’d landed where names mattered. He nodded once,
    but he didn’t step off the top plank. He stayed positioned where the path dropped
    toward the beach, as if his body could hold someone back.


    “You called,” Sarah said, notebook raised. “Said you noticed something.”


    Elias’s eyes slid toward the water. “Something in the surf.”


    Sarah didn’t follow his gaze. She looked at his boots—rubber, wet to the ankle,
    sand ridged fresh along the sides—and at his hands, too clean for the tide line.
    “What time were you down there?”


    “Before dawn.”


    She wrote: *before dawn.* Not a time. “When the buoy started signaling two-and-two?”


    He blinked. “It always rings.”


    “Not like that.” Two. Pause. Two. The bell sounded again, nearer, then farther.
    In fog, the harbor could pretend anything was anywhere.


    Elias licked his lips. “I didn’t count.”


    Sarah shut the notebook and started down the beach path. Fog beaded on her lashes;
    the world narrowed to damp boards and the next post emerging only when she was
    close enough to touch it. She paced her steps evenly. In low visibility, speed
    created opportunities for mistakes—and for other people.

    that bell.


    A darker shape moved beyond the dunes—cloth against gray—then the fog thickened
    and the shape was gone.


    Sarah stayed still, counting three slow breaths, eyes fixed on the blankness.
    The fog wasn’t just cover; it was an accomplice. It erased the moment she tried
    to record.


    The beach arrived all at once, as if the weather had decided she’d earned it.
    Waves advanced and retreated with quiet aggression. Kelp made dark parentheses
    along the high-water line. Elias lingered at the top of the dunes, a reluctant
    silhouette.


    Sarah walked the wrack line in a careful grid—left to right, down, forward—counting
    steps between landmarks: glass, rope, a green-painted buoy, eelgrass. When the

    A man lay on his side, half-turned toward the sea. Mid-thirties. Jacket heavy
    with water. Skin waxy with cold. Sarah did not touch him. She circled wide, eyes

    Drag marks—too straight for tide—began above the waterline and aimed toward the

    lighter band of skin—something removed. She leaned in without contact and brushed
    sand away with the edge of a folded evidence card.


    Tiny block letters emerged.


    *HARBORLIGHT-12.*


    Her breath hitched hard enough to sting. For a second the beach tilted—fog, surf,
    bell—everything sliding out of alignment. The buoy’s two-and-two sounded suddenly
    inside her skull. Her pen slipped from her fingers and clicked against her phone
    screen, loud in the hush, a sharp little crack in her practiced control.


    She pressed her palm to her thigh to steady the tremor. In her car, under that
    file box lid, a folder tab wore the same kind of lettering. She had refused to
    read it twice. She had moved towns to keep it from becoming a sentence she had
    to finish.


    A voice surfaced from memory—her old captain, flat and tired: *We all make choices.*
    As if choices scrubbed blood.


    The ink on the dead man’s wrist said otherwise.


    Behind her, Elias’s lighter sparked; the cigarette finally took. “You look like
    you saw a ghost,” he said.


    Sarah straightened slowly. Fog folded itself between dunes and road, swallowing
    the path back. It would blur footprints in minutes. It would let a man stand ten
    yards away and be nobody.


    She watched Elias’s steady hands, the way he’d stayed at the top of the path,
    the way he’d answered in foggy words. The drag marks pointed toward him whether
    he meant them to or not.


    “You didn’t just find him,” Sarah said. Not accusation. Calibration.


    Elias exhaled; the smoke thinned and vanished. “If I tell you,” he said, “you’re
    not going to like what it means for this town.”


    Sarah opened her notebook again. One line, precise: *HARBORLIGHT-12 confirmed.*


    Then a fresh page, a decision written before she could talk herself out of it:
    *Call Major Crimes. Request file transfer. Reopen.*

  twice. She had moved towns to keep it from becoming a sentence she had to finish.


  A voice surfaced from memory—her old captain, flat and tired: *We all make choices.*
  As if choices scrubbed blood.


  The ink on the dead man’s wrist said otherwise.


  Behind her, Elias’s lighter sparked; the cigarette finally took. “You look like
