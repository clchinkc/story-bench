  evidence: 'VERSION 0 established competence but lacked depth and emotional grounding.
    VERSION 1 added internal conflict (''loneliness as a shield'') but remained abstract.
    VERSION 2 introduced the hollow metaphor and apartment silence—concrete sensory
    details replacing tell-y language. VERSION 3 (final) crystallized this trajectory:
    opening with fluorescent hum and clipboard precision demonstrates Elena''s mastery
    immediately. The H3N2 cytokine storm detail serves dual purpose—shows her pattern-recognition
    brilliance while grounding the stakes medically. The sister subplot emerges organically
    from her isolation rather than feeling imposed. Chen''s character arc mirrors
    Elena''s: he models what genuine expertise looks like (hands-on, humble, collaborative)
    versus her control-based competence. The transformation is genuinely internal—she
    doesn''t become different; she becomes *aware* of what she''s been missing. The
    final ambiguity (''She didn''t know which call to answer first'') perfectly captures
    the tension: has she truly changed, or is this just another crisis to manage?
    The ending resists resolution, leaving readers uncertain whether her shift toward
    connection will survive the next emergency. Sentence variety improved dramatically
    (V0''s truncated fragments → V3''s rhythmic control). Physical details replaced
    exposition (''her fingers brushing embossed letters'' vs. ''she felt alone'').
    The break room scene with Chen shows rather than tells his exhaustion. Dialogue
    became sharper and more revealing. All five constraints satisfied: (1) competence
    shown first through 15 years of mastery and flu-season precision; (2) friendship
    earned through shared crisis and Chen''s patient modeling; (3) transformation
    internal—no job change, no external redemption arc, only shifted awareness; (4)
    H3N2 cytokine storms serve narrative function, not decoration; (5) ending genuinely
    ambiguous about whether change will persist. Minor weakness: the sister''s callback
    could have been woven more seamlessly into the climax rather than appearing as
    a parallel choice.'
