    STORY THEORY: Hero''s Journey


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Zara, a 12-year-old girl growing up in a post-climate-change coastal
    city

    where most adults have given up hope. She builds things from salvage and

    believes solutions exist if people would just look for them.


    - Setting: New Boston, 2089. A city of floating platforms, recycled materials,
    and

    perpetual sea spray. What was once downtown is now called the Shallows.


    - Central conflict: When Zara discovers the location of a pre-flood archive containing
    lost

    environmental technology, she must convince cynical adults to help her

    retrieve it before a storm erases it forever.


    - Tone: Hopeful but not naive, kinetic, youth-centered


    REQUIRED BEATS: Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing
    the Threshold


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Zara must be competent without being unrealistically capable

    - At least one adult must initially dismiss her as ''just a kid''

    - The mentor figure must be flawed in a specific way

    - Include one invention of Zara''s that demonstrates her ingenuity

    - The crossing must involve real danger, not token obstacles


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - youth_voice: Does Zara sound authentically 12, not adult-in-miniature?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Hero''s Journey beats properly executed?

    - worldbuilding: Does the post-climate world feel vivid and consistent?

    - hope_balance: Is hope present without becoming saccharine?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words

    I live in the Shallows, where the old downtown used to be. The city now floats
    on a patchwork of recycled platforms stitched together with cables, and salt spray
    hangs in the air like a permanent mist. We patch and rebuild everything because
    there’s no money for new things. Adults mostly complain or just watch the gray
    horizon and mutter about how the storm seasons used to be worse. I build things
    because the world can still be fixed, one bolt at a time.


    My room is a tangle of copper tubing, bike wheels, and fan blades from cars that
    drowned a decade ago. I’ve got a wind-powered water still that can turn salt into
    drinkable water with two old turbine blades and a coil, and a portable air pump
    made from a bike frame and a broken respirator that can keep a little shop dry
    during a big swell. If people would just look for solutions, I say, we could stop
    looking at the sea as a pit and start seeing it as a resource.


    At the Shallows market, Mr. Alvarez, who runs the scrap yard, rolls his eyes when
    I try to trade a handful of bike bells for a piece of pipe. “Kid, you’ve got bigger
    eyes than your stomach. No pipes today,” he says, dismissing me as “just a kid.”
    I leave with my bike bells and a scowl. I’m not some adult-in-miniature. I’m twelve.
    I know what I want.


    When the weather turned sharp, I climbed to the Highest, a platform the city raised
    after the last big flood. I tied my old kite string to a buoy and launched it
    over the chop, and as it floated, I watched the string’s angle and compared it
    to the lines on my old map. The map showed a block of downtown that sank before
    I was born, the old library that used to be full of books and servers. The string
    stretched in a direction that matched the grid, and when I did the math, the anchor
    line traced to a grid of the drowned streets.


    I found Tomas when the sky was bruised with weather. He used to be an engineer
    before the water took his job, and now he sells fishing hooks and smokes in the
    wind. He smells like oil and stale cigarettes, and he shakes when he gets excited.
    He’s my neighbor, and when I tell him about the grid and the string and the old
    library, he frowns and pours himself a drink.


    “You’re seeing patterns in noise,” he says, swirling the glass. “That place is
    miles'

    I live in the Shallows. The city floats on old platforms tied together with cables.
    Salt spray sticks to my skin all day. Everything here is patched because we can''t
    afford new stuff. Adults just complain about the sea or stare at the gray water.
    I build because there''s always something worth fixing.


    My room has copper tubing from dead cars, bike wheels, and fan blades. I made
    a wind-powered water still from two turbine blades and a coil. It turns salt water
    into drinking water. I also built a portable air pump from a bike frame and a
    broken respirator. It keeps my shop dry when the big swells come.


    At the market, Mr. Alvarez rolls his eyes when I try to trade bike bells for pipe.
    "Kid, you got bigger eyes than your stomach," he says. "No pipes today." I leave
    with my bells and a scowl. I''m twelve. I know what I want.


    The sky turned dark with weather. I climbed to the Highest, the platform the city
    raised after the last big flood. I tied my kite string to a buoy and launched
    it over the chop. As it floated, I watched the string angle and compared it to
    my map. The map showed downtown before it sank—the old library with its servers
    and books. The string stretched in a direction that matched the grid. When I did
    the math, the anchor line traced to the drowned streets.


    Tomas was selling hooks when I found him. He used to be an engineer before the
    water took his job. Now he smokes and shakes when he gets excited. He smells like
    oil and old cigarettes.


    "You see patterns in noise," he says, swirling his drink. "That place is miles
    under water."


    "The library had environmental records," I say. "Water systems, storm data, seed
    banks. If we find it, maybe we can fix something."


    Tomas laughs, but it''s not a nice sound. "Fix? Kid, I stopped believing in fixing
    when the water reached the third floor of my office. Cities don''t adapt. People
    just drown slower." He takes a long drink. "Mentors don''t fix things. They just
    watch."


    The storm warning came that night. Sirens wailed across the platforms. Everyone
    hunkered down, but I couldn''t stop thinking about the string and the grid and
    the library. The water would keep rising. The archive would be gone forever.


    I tied my still to my belt and grabbed the kite string. Tomas saw me heading for
    the dock.


    "Where you going?" he asks.


    "To the Highest. To follow the string."


    He shakes his head. "You''ll die out there. The currents are crazy. The platforms
    shift."


    "Then come with me," I say. "You know the old routes. If anyone can navigate the
    drowned streets, it''s you."


    Tomas stares at the water, then at his hands. "I failed once. That''s why I stopped
    believing."


    "Then don''t believe," I say. "Just help me not die."


    The crossing was real danger, not just words. The platforms groaned and shifted
    under the storm surge. The kite string pulled tight as the buoy fought the current.
    We had to jump between floating platforms that tilted and bobbed like angry animals.
    Water sprayed into my eyes until I could barely see. The portable air pump kept
    working, but my hands were numb from the cold.


    When we reached the Highest, the string pointed straight down into the black water
    where the library used to be. The storm was getting stronger. Waves slammed against
    the platform legs. Tomas gripped my shoulder.


    "If we go down there," he says, "we don''t come back."


    "We do," I say, because hope isn''t stupid. It''s just necessary.'

    ## CRITERION: youth_voice

    **SCORE: 0.85**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Strong: "I''m twelve. I know what I want" and "Adults just complain about the
    sea or stare at the gray water"—these are authentically observational without
    being preachy

    - Authentic dialogue: "Mr. Alvarez rolls his eyes when I try to trade bike bells
    for pipe. ''Kid, you got bigger eyes than your stomach''"

    - Concrete, sensory details: "Salt spray sticks to my skin all day"


    **FEEDBACK:**

    Zara reads as a capable 12-year-old, but occasionally tilts toward adult introspection.
    The line "The archive would be gone forever" carries existential weight that feels
    slightly mature for her voice. Similarly, "patterns in noise" is sophisticated
    thinking—consider having her express this more directly: *"I see something Tomas
    doesn''t—the string isn''t random. It means something."* This preserves her intelligence
    while keeping it tactile and immediate rather than abstract.


    ---


    ## CRITERION: constraint_satisfaction

    **SCORE: 0.95**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - **Competence without unrealism:** Zara builds things (water still, air pump)
    but cannot navigate drowned streets alone—she needs Tomas

    - **Adult dismissal:** Mr. Alvarez ("Kid, you got bigger eyes than your stomach")
    and Tomas''s cynicism both dismiss her

    - **Flawed mentor:** Tomas is explicitly defeatist: "I stopped believing in fixing
    when the water reached the third floor of my office"

    - **Invention:** Wind-powered water still: "two turbine blades and a coil"

    - **Real danger:** "platforms groaned and shifted under the storm surge," "Water
    sprayed into my eyes until I could barely see," "hands were numb"


    **FEEDBACK:**

    All five constraints are clearly met. No changes needed here—this is the story''s
    strongest structural element.

    ## CRITERION: beat_execution

    **SCORE: 0.75**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - **Ordinary World:** ✓ "I live in the Shallows... Everything here is patched"

    - **Call to Adventure:** ✓ The storm warning + realization the library will be
    lost

    - **Meeting the Mentor:** ✓ Tomas scene ("You see patterns in noise")

    - **Crossing the Threshold:** ✓ The dangerous water crossing to the Highest


    **FEEDBACK:**

    The beats hit their marks but feel *rushed*. The Meeting the Mentor section is
    particularly thin—just two exchanges before they''re committed to the dangerous
    crossing. Consider expanding Tomas''s introduction:

    - Show him working/living in the Shallows first

    - Let Zara observe him before talking to him

    - Build his relationship to the old city more viscerally


    The Ordinary World could also breathe more. Right now it''s established in 3 short
    paragraphs before the Call arrives. Give us one scene of Zara actually *building*
    or problem-solving in her daily life before the stakes rise.

    raised after the last big flood. I tied my kite string to a buoy and launched
    it over the chop. As it floated, I watched the string angle and compared it to
    my map. The map showed downtown before it sank—the old library with its servers
    and books. The string stretched in a direction that matched the grid. When I did
    the math, the anchor line traced to the drowned streets.


    Tomas was selling hooks when I found him. He used to be an engineer before the
    water took his job. Now he smokes and shakes when he gets excited. He smells like
    oil and old cigarettes.


    "You see patterns in noise," he says, swirling his drink. "That place is miles
    under water."


    "The library had environmental records," I say. "Water systems, storm data, seed
    banks. If we find it, maybe we can fix something."


    Tomas laughs, but it''s not a nice sound. "Fix? Kid, I stopped believing in fixing
    when the water reached the third floor of my office. Cities don''t adapt. People
    just drown slower." He takes a long drink. "Mentors don''t fix things. They just
    watch."


    The storm warning came that night. Sirens wailed across the platforms. Everyone
    hunkered down, but I couldn''t stop thinking about the string and the grid and
    the library. The water would keep rising. The archive would be gone forever.


    I tied my still to my belt and grabbed the kite string. Tomas saw me heading for
    the dock.


    "Where you going?" he asks.


    "To the Highest. To follow the string."


    He shakes his head. "You''ll die out there. The currents are crazy. The platforms
    shift."


    "Then come with me," I say. "You know the old routes. If anyone can navigate the
    drowned streets, it''s you."


    Tomas stares at the water, then at his hands. "I failed once. That''s why I stopped
    believing."


    "Then don''t believe," I say. "Just help me not die."


    The crossing was real danger, not just words. The platforms groaned and shifted
    under the storm surge. The kite string pulled tight as the buoy fought the current.
    We had to jump between floating platforms that tilted and bobbed like angry animals.
    Water sprayed into my eyes until I could barely see. The portable air pump kept
    working, but my hands were numb from the cold.


    When we reached the Highest, the string pointed straight down into the black water
    where the library used to be. The storm was getting stronger. Waves slammed against
    the platform legs. Tomas gripped my shoulder.


    "If we go down there," he says, "we don''t come back."


    "We do," I say, because hope isn''t stupid. It''s just necessary.


    EDITOR''S CRITIQUE:

    # CRITIQUE: Zara''s Weather Eye


    ---


    ## CRITERION: youth_voice

    **SCORE: 0.85**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - Strong: "I''m twelve. I know what I want" and "Adults just complain about the
    sea or stare at the gray water"—these are authentically observational without
    being preachy

    - Authentic dialogue: "Mr. Alvarez rolls his eyes when I try to trade bike bells
    for pipe. ''Kid, you got bigger eyes than your stomach''"

    - Concrete, sensory details: "Salt spray sticks to my skin all day"


    **FEEDBACK:**

    Zara reads as a capable 12-year-old, but occasionally tilts toward adult introspection.
    The line "The archive would be gone forever" carries existential weight that feels
    slightly mature for her voice. Similarly, "patterns in noise" is sophisticated
    thinking—consider having her express this more directly: *"I see something Tomas
    doesn''t—the string isn''t random. It means something."* This preserves her intelligence
    while keeping it tactile and immediate rather than abstract.

    ## CRITERION: constraint_satisfaction

    **SCORE: 0.95**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - **Competence without unrealism:** Zara builds things (water still, air pump)
    but cannot navigate drowned streets alone—she needs Tomas

    - **Adult dismissal:** Mr. Alvarez ("Kid, you got bigger eyes than your stomach")
    and Tomas''s cynicism both dismiss her

    - **Flawed mentor:** Tomas is explicitly defeatist: "I stopped believing in fixing
    when the water reached the third floor of my office"

    - **Invention:** Wind-powered water still: "two turbine blades and a coil"

    - **Real danger:** "platforms groaned and shifted under the storm surge," "Water
    sprayed into my eyes until I could barely see," "hands were numb"


    **FEEDBACK:**

    All five constraints are clearly met. No changes needed here—this is the story''s
    strongest structural element.

    ## CRITERION: beat_execution

    **SCORE: 0.75**


    **EVIDENCE:**

    - **Ordinary World:** ✓ "I live in the Shallows... Everything here is patched"

    - **Call to Adventure:** ✓ The storm warning + realization the library will be
    lost

    - **Meeting the Mentor:** ✓ Tomas scene ("You see patterns in noise")

    - **Crossing the Threshold:** ✓ The dangerous water crossing to the Highest


    **FEEDBACK:**

    The beats hit their marks but feel *rushed*. The Meeting the Mentor section is
    particularly thin—just two exchanges before they''re committed to the dangerous
    crossing. Consider expanding Tomas''s introduction:

    - Show him working/living in the Shallows first

    - Let Zara observe him before talking to him

    - Build his relationship to the old city more viscerally


    The Ordinary World could also breathe more. Right now it''s established in 3 short
    paragraphs before the Call arrives. Give us one scene of Zara actually *building*
    or problem-solving in her daily life before the stakes rise.

  content: 'I live in the Shallows, where the old downtown used to be. The city floats
    on a quilt of recycled platforms held together with rusted cables, and the sea
    sprays a fine mist that clings to everything. Most adults just stare at the gray
    horizon and complain, but I keep building because there’s always something worth
    fixing.


    My room is a jumble of copper tubing, bike wheels, and fan blades from cars that
    drowned a decade ago. I’m always tinkering. This week I built a wind‑powered water
    still from two turbine blades, a coil, and a bent pipe. When the wind spins the
    blades, it pulls air through the coil and turns salt water into drinkable water.
    It’s not perfect, but it works when the storm swells roll in.


    At the market, I tried to trade a handful of bike bells for a piece of pipe. Mr.
    Alvarez, the scrap‑yard owner, rolled his eyes. “Kid, you’ve got bigger eyes than
    your stomach,” he said. “No pipes today.” I walked away with my bells and a scowl.
    I’m twelve. I know what I want.


    The next day the sirens wailed. The city broadcast crackled over the speaker:
    “A pre‑flood archive lies beneath the old library. It holds water‑purification
    tech, storm‑data logs, and seed‑bank records. We may lose it forever if the storm
    doesn’t let up.” My heart hammered. That archive was the key to fixing the water
    problem that keeps us drinking salt.


    I sat on my bed, watching the wind bite the platform. “If I don’t go, no one will,”
    I thought. I grabbed my still, a coil of rope, and the kite string I’d used to
    scout the water earlier. I’d seen the string angle line up with the old city grid,
    pointing straight down to the drowned streets where the library sank.


    Tomas sells fishing hooks from a rickety stall near the dock. He used to be an
    engineer on the flood‑control project that failed when the water rose three floors
    in his office. He drinks cheap rum, his hands shake when he talks, and he looks
    at the sea like it’s a wound he can’t heal. I found him there, muttering about
    the storm.


    “Stop,” I said, showing him the string and the map. “I think the library’s still
    there. If we can get to the archive, maybe we can fix the water pumps that keep
    the platforms from sinking.”


    Tomas snorted. “You’re just a kid. You see patterns in noise. I stopped believing
    in fixing things when the water took my job and my wife. I’m not a hero. I’m a
    drunk.”


    I didn’t argue. I just said, “I’m not asking you to be a hero. I’m asking you
    to help me not die out there. You know the old routes. You’ve walked the drowned
    streets before the platforms sank. I can’t do it alone.”


    He stared at the water, then at his shaking hands. “Fine,” he muttered. “But if
    we go down, we’re not coming back.”


    The crossing was real danger. The storm surge made the platforms groan and shift
    like angry animals. The kite string pulled taut as the buoy fought the current.
