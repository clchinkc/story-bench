  evidence: 'The plan is detailed and the final output follows it closely: Yuki''s
    isolation is shown through concrete behaviors (haptic gloves, automated declines,
    scheduled ''Socialization'' blocks), Elias functions as the challenging colleague,
    Silas is an unconventional mentor (blind synesthetic composer), and the Threshold
    is psychological (decision to remove gloves/enter the tank). All four required
    beats (Call to Adventure, Refusal, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing the Threshold)
    are executed. One clear moment of human connection (Yuki grabbing Elias''s hand
    and him squeezing back) is present. The single notable failure is that the alien
    signal, while described with alien mediums (gravity flux, 4-D geometry), is explicitly
    mapped to human emotions (''loneliness'', ''grief''), which makes it feel anthropomorphic
    and thus violates that constraint. Overall prose, pacing, and tension are strong
    but marred slightly by that anthropomorphizing choice.'
