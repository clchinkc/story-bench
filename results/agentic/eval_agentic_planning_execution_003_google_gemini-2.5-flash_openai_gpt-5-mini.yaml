  evidence: 'Plan: promising logline and detailed Act 1 beats (kimchi, banchan, Mr.
    Henderson, demolition notice) but omitted Act 2/3 specifics, so incomplete. Specificity:
    concrete sensory detail and events in Act 1 (kkakdugi, barley tea, phone call)
    but plan lacks later beats. Adherence: final output closely follows the Act 1
    plan (photo of Hana, demolition notice, Mr. Henderson, Mia call about California)
    — good adherence for provided section. Constraints: satisfied — (1) food used
    symbolically multiple times (banchan/kimchi described as identity/defiance), (2)
    grief present implicitly via framed photo and unspoken pain, (3) estrangement
    has a specific cause (he missed her college graduation; argument about stubbornness),
    (4) regular customer Mr. Henderson represents the loyal community, (6) a Korean
    cultural element beyond food appears (Mia calls him ''Appa''); (5) ending hopeful
    but not unrealistically happy is missing — no Act 3 in output. Beats: only Setup
    (Act 1) executed; Confrontation and Resolution absent. Narrative quality: writing
    is evocative, well-paced for Act 1 with good tension, but overall story incomplete
    due to missing later acts.'
