  evidence: 'VERSION 0-1: Incremental refinement of sensory language; added scent
    and vibration alongside sound. VERSION 1-2: Sharpened focus on Imani''s podcast
    and auditory expertise; removed vague phrasing (''flawlessl...''). VERSION 2-3:
    Elevated opening metaphor (''wrapped around her like a familiar blanket''); introduced
    the metallic clack as specific audio clue; added Detective Marcus Reed''s dismissal
    establishing underestimation. FINAL OUTPUT: Fully realized all constraints. Non-visual
    sensory details dominate (humidity, sounds, vibrations, scents). Imani''s blindness
    portrayed as analytical strength—her acute hearing enables investigation others
    miss. The metallic ''clack'' becomes crucial plot device, isolated and analyzed.
    Marcus Reed explicitly underestimates her (''you''re a podcaster, not some detective'').
    ''Fun and Games'' phase genuinely entertains (quirky locals, sound experiments,
    street musician) before pivoting to menacing anonymous calls and danger. Trajectory
    shows consistent strengthening: V0 was generic setup; V1 added sensory depth;
    V2 clarified stakes; V3-Final integrated all elements cohesively. Minor weakness:
    the transition from ''Fun and Games'' to dark tone could be more abrupt/shocking
    for maximum impact—currently feels somewhat gradual. The final section effectively
    demonstrates how Imani''s sensory world becomes ''a battleground,'' completing
    the arc from strength to vulnerability to triumph.'
