  evidence: 'From V0→V3 the prose was tightened and scene details clarified (lighting,
    whiteboards, joke mechanics). Key strengths—humor before sadness, theme voiced
    by Jenna, Lily''s perceptiveness—were preserved. Critics'' main concern about
    emotional payoff remained: the story sets up strong pathos but lacks a decisive
    ''All Is Lost'' and clear transformational payoff, so Save the Cat beats feel
    only partially executed.'
