  evidence: The initial versions were very short, only setting the scene. The final
    version significantly expands the narrative, introducing the core conflict, the
    grandmother's role, and the resolution. The expansion directly addresses the need
    to show, not tell, Mateo's conflict and includes the specific moments required
    by the constraints. The core descriptive elements from the early versions were
    preserved and built upon.
