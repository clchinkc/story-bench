  evidence: The initial versions were very short and lacked any real development.
    Version 2 started to introduce the conflict and cultural elements. The final version
    significantly expanded on these, adding the grandmother's pivotal moment, Mr.
    Alvarez's understanding, and Mateo's internal struggle. The narrative quality
    improved dramatically from a basic setup to a compelling short story. The only
    constraint not fully met was the 'show, not tell' for Mateo's internal conflict,
    as there were still some instances of telling (e.g., 'He couldn’t tell Mr. Alvarez
    the choice felt like tearing himself in half'). However, much of it was shown
    through his actions and unspoken thoughts.
