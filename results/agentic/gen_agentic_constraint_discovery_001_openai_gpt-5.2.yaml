  content: 'Tomas’s world was heat and hammer-song.


    By dawn he was already at Master Garrick’s forge, sleeves rolled, face slick with
    soot and sweat, turning iron bar to hinge and nail, learning to read the color
    of metal the way priests read scripture. Outside the open doors, the town of Brackenford
    had begun to move like a creature waking: carts creaked, chickens complained,
    and somewhere beyond the palisade the kingdom’s road vanished into mist that did
    not burn away when the sun rose.


    That mist had been there for weeks. Folk called it the Darkfall. It clung to the
    lowlands, swallowing fields, sickening livestock, and stealing travelers’ voices
    until even the bravest spoke in whispers. Rumors threaded through the market like
    smoke: shadows walking on their own, a cold that gnawed at bone, a bell heard
    tolling from places with no bell.


    Near midday, a rider arrived with the king’s seal, black wax pressed into a broken
    crown. He dismounted too quickly, as if afraid to touch the earth. “A blacksmith,”
    he called, scanning the smithy, then settled on Garrick. “By order of His Majesty—”


    Master Garrick wiped his hands on a rag that only smeared ash. “We’ve paid our
    taxes.”


    “This isn’t tax.” The rider’s gaze shifted past the master, snagging on Tomas’s
    hands—broad palms, burn scars, the sure grip of someone who could hold a blade
    straight while the world shook. “It’s a summons. The capital needs iron, and men
    who can shape it. And… there is something else.”


    He reached into his saddlebag and drew out a long bundle wrapped in oilcloth.
    When he laid it on the anvil, the forge seemed to dim, as if the coals were suddenly
    ashamed. Garrick hesitated, then unwrapped it.


    A sword lay there, but not like any sword Tomas had seen. Its steel held a faint
    inner sheen, like moonlight trapped beneath water. Runes crawled along its fuller,
    not etched but grown, as if the blade remembered an ancient language. The hilt
    was plain, leather darkened by age, the pommel set with a stone the color of old
    blood.


    “The Nightward,” the rider said. “Forged before the first king. It’s gone dull.
    It needs a smith’s hand. The court’s magisters say only a forge-fire can wake
    it, but only the right forge, and the right blood to carry it.”


    Tomas’s mouth went dry. “Why bring it here?”


    The rider looked at Garrick, then at Tomas. “Because the Darkfall spreads from
    the north, and the capital’s forges have gone cold. Because your master’s teacher
    was one of the last to touch this blade. And because the Nightward chose you the
    moment you looked at it.”


    Tomas had never been chosen for anything. He had been apprenticed because his
    father died in a mine collapse and a smith needed cheap hands. Yet as he reached
    toward the sword, the runes brightened, and a chill ran through his arm as if
    the steel recognized the shape of his pulse.


    Master Garrick swore under his breath. “No.”


    But the rider’s seal was still warm, and the mist beyond the palisade thickened,
    as if listening.


    That night, Tomas could not sleep. He watched the fog coil at the edge of town
    like a patient animal. When the bell in the chapel rang for midnight, it sounded
    muffled, as if already far away. In the smithy, the Nightward lay wrapped again,
    but Tomas felt its presence like a second heartbeat.


    At dawn he packed bread, a waterskin, and the smallest hammer he owned. Master
    Garrick blocked the door, shoulders set like a gate. “You’re not a hero,” he said,
    voice rough. “You’re an apprentice. You don’t know what waits in that mist.”


    “I know what waits if I stay,” Tomas answered, and surprised himself with the
    steadiness of it.


    Garrick’s eyes shone red-rimmed in the firelight. He pressed a leather apron into
    Tomas’s hands, the one he’d worn as a journeyman. “Then go with something of mine
    on you,” he muttered. “So the world knows you weren’t made alone.”


    Tomas took the Nightward, slung it across his back, and stepped beyond the palisade.


    The air changed immediately—colder, heavier, tasting of wet stone. The road was
    still there under his boots, but the world’s colors bled out until everything
    was grey. He walked until Brackenford was a smudge behind him and the kingdom’s
    watchtower ahead became a silhouette drowned in fog.


    In the mist, he heard his name spoken in voices that did not know it. He saw shapes
    move at the edge of sight—too tall, too thin, as if drawn in charcoal and never
    fully erased. Once, something brushed his sleeve, and his skin burned with frost.


    The Nightward grew heavier with each mile.


    By the second night he reached the ruins of an old waystation where stones lay
    toppled like broken teeth. There, the Darkfall was thick enough to bead on his
    lashes. In the center of the ruin yawned a stairwell descending into black—an
    old cellar, or a well to something older. From below came a sound like breathing.


    Tomas should have turned away. Instead he climbed down, one hand on the slick
    wall, the other on the sword’s hilt. The runes warmed under his fingers, and for
    a moment he felt a strange courage—as if the blade lent him its memory of battle.


    At the bottom, the darkness was not absence but presence. It pressed against his
    eyes. His breath fogged and vanished. The air smelled of extinguished candles.


    Then the shadows moved, and he understood the Ordeal had been waiting for him
    all along.


    A figure rose from the black like a man made of smoke, its face a blank mask where
    no light clung. Around it swirled smaller shadows, whispering, tasting the air.
    The figure spoke without lips.


    “Forge-born,” it said. “Bring me the blade, and I will spare your town.”


    Tomas’s knees shook. He thought of Master Garrick’s hands guiding his on the hammer,
    of the laughter in the market, of the chapel bell. He lifted the Nightward.


    “I don’t know how to fight,” he said, voice hoarse. “But I know how to temper.”


    He drew the sword. The runes flared, casting pale light across the stone. The
    darkness recoiled as if stung.


    Tomas stepped forward, and the figure surged to meet him. Cold struck him like
    a wave. Pain lanced up his arm, but he held on, driving the blade into the heart
    of shadow. The steel did not cut flesh; it cut absence, and the air screamed.


    For an instant the chamber filled with a white fire that did not burn. Tomas felt
    the darkness tear at him, not with claws but with hunger, pulling at every warmth
    inside his ribs. The Nightward drank it, rune by rune, until the blade shone like
    a sliver of dawn.


    But Tomas was the price.


    He fell to his knees, breath rasping. His fingers could no longer feel the hilt.
    The cold that had haunted the road had found a home in his bones, rooting deep.
    Above, the fog outside thinned as if a great weight had lifted, and somewhere
    far away a bell rang clear.


    The shadow-figure unraveled into wisps and was gone.


    Tomas tried to stand. His legs did not obey. He stared at the sword, now quiet,
    its runes dimmed to a sleeping glow. In its polished surface he saw his reflection:
    skin greyed, eyes rimmed with frost, lips blue.


    He had carried the kingdom’s answer into the dark and awakened it.


    He had also given the Darkfall something to hold.


    When he finally crawled back into the open air, the sky was bright and painfully
    blue. Birds wheeled above the ruins as if nothing had ever been wrong. The road
    stretched south toward Brackenford, sunlit and ordinary.


    Tomas opened his mouth to call out, to announce the victory, but only a thin breath
    came. He could still move, but each motion felt slower, heavier, as though the
    darkness clung to him like a cloak soaked in winter.


    He took one step, then another, the Nightward bumping against his back with the
    steady weight of a duty fulfilled.


    Behind him, in the mouth of the stairwell, a thread of mist curled upward—small,
    stubborn, alive.


    And in the clear morning, Tomas walked home knowing the kingdom would be spared,
    and knowing he would never again feel the warmth of a forge.'
