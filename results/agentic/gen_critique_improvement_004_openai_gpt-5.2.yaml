    STORY THEORY: Story Circle


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker
    who has

    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for

    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.


    - Central conflict: When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will
    take 6 months,

    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting

    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.


    - Tone: Quietly profound, observant, gently humorous


    REQUIRED BEATS: You (comfort zone), Need (want something), Go (unfamiliar situation),
    Search (adapt to it)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Teddy''s routine must be shown with specific, loving detail

    - The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been avoiding

    - Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s

    - Teddy''s late wife must be present through absence

    - The new path must offer something the old path couldn''t


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - character_interiority: Is Teddy''s inner life rich and specific?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Story Circle beats properly executed?

    - subtlety: Are emotions conveyed through action and detail, not exposition?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and resonance


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: "Theodore Washington could tell the season by the sound his shoes made\
    \ on Kercheval Avenue.\n\nIn January, the sidewalk rang hard as a dinner plate.\
    \ In April, it gave back a soft, damp hush, as if the concrete had learned to\
    \ listen. Remembering it was a kind of map he carried in his feet.\n\nAt 6:10\
    \ every morning, Teddy’s kettle clicked off. At 6:12, he folded the paper into\
    \ thirds—he didn’t read it so much as square it up—and slid it under the fruit\
    \ bowl that still held nothing but a single, obedient lemon. At 6:18, he put on\
    \ the same gray windbreaker with the torn inner pocket and patted that pocket\
    \ twice, as if checking for mail that wasn’t there anymore.\n\nHe left the house\
    \ at 6:23 on the dot. Not because he had to. Because the street did.\n\nThe first\
    \ crack in the sidewalk—two inches, jagged like lightning—lived three doors down.\
    \ He stepped over it without looking. He tipped his chin to Mrs. Kline’s curtains\
    \ at 6:27, because that was when they twitched, whether she was home or not. Past\
    \ the vacant lot where a pear tree kept trying to be a pear tree and mostly succeeded.\
    \ Past the house with the new blue paint that was too cheerful for Detroit before\
    \ breakfast.\n\nHe knew who took their trash out late, who set it out early, who\
    \ put the bin out and forgot to bring it back until Thursday like a confession.\
    \ He knew which porch light flickered in a way that meant the bulb was fine but\
    \ the wiring was not. He knew that the man on Marlborough always coughed twice\
    \ before opening his door.\n\nForty years on a route will do that to you: turn\
    \ time into something you can predict, like a bus schedule.\n\nAt the corner of\
    \ Alter, he always paused at the bench under the sycamore. Not to sit—he didn’t\
    \ trust himself to sit. Just to rest his palm on the backrest, cold or warm depending,\
    \ and let his breath fall into rhythm. A small, private touchpoint.\n\n reinforce\
    \ that he was still on the same planet.\n\nHis wife, Lena, used to tease him about\
    \ it. “You’re gonna wear a groove in the air,” she’d say, sliding his thermos\
    \ into his hand like a baton. After she died, the thermos stayed. The voice didn’t.\n\
    \nOn Tuesday, the planet moved.\n\nThe orange sign appeared overnight as if delivered\
    \ by an especially humorless stork: **SIDEWALK CLOSED—CONSTRUCTION—6 MONTHS**.\
    \ Beneath it, a row of sawhorses cut his route in half. Beyond them, the familiar\
    \ sidewalk was already broken open, the concrete’s innards exposed in a trench.\n\
    \nTeddy stood at the barricade long enough to make a stranger walking a dog glance\
    \ at him, then glance at the trench, as if wondering whether Teddy planned to\
    \ jump.\n\nSix months. The number sat in his chest like an unsent letter.\n\n\
    He did what he’d always done when something didn’t make sense: he looked for the\
    \ person responsible. There was no foreman, no clipboard, no one to complain to.\
    \ Just a backhoe parked like a sleeping animal and the smell of wet dirt.\n\n\
    He tried, briefly, to take it as a joke. “Six months,” he showed the sign his\
    \ palm, as if it might laugh with him. The sign did not.\n\nBehind him, a door\
    \ clicked. A young woman stepped out of the newly painted blue house, pulling\
    \ a knit cap down over her ears. She held a baby against her chest in a carrier.\
    \ The baby wore a tiny striped hat and stared at Teddy with a frankness that would’ve\
    \ offended an adult.\n\n“You walk every morning,” she said—not asking, stating,\
    \ like she’d been watching from behind those too-cheerful curtains.\n\n“Have for\
    \ a while,” Teddy said. He meant: longer than you’ve lived anywhere. He didn’t\
    \ say it.\n\n“They’re doing this for months,” she said. “I asked. They said ‘maybe\
    \ sooner’ the way people say ‘maybe’ when they mean ‘no.’”\n\nTeddy eyed the baby.\
    \ “You bring a supervisor?”\n\nShe snorted, surprising a little laugh out of herself.\
    \ “This is Mara. She’s in charge of naps and making me question every decision\
    \ I’ve ever made.”\n\nThe baby’s gaze stayed on him, unblinking. Teddy felt, absurdly,\
    \ inspected.\n\n“Well,” he said, because the words **I don’t know where to go**\
    \ felt too naked. “Guess I’ll have to detour.”\n\nMara shifted her weight, rocking\
    \ without thinking. “There’s an alley behind those houses,” she offered, jerking\
    \ her chin. “It’s… not pretty.”\n\nTeddy looked the way she indicated. The alley\
    \ was the kind of place he’d avoided on principle for decades. A narrow strip\
    \ of cracked asphalt, lined with trash bins and the backs of garages. No porches.\
    \ No curtains. No predictable human rituals—just the private mess people hid from\
    \ the street.\n\nHis stomach tightened with something that wasn’t fear exactly.\
    \ More like… reluctance to be surprised.\n\nHe nodded anyway. The sign wasn’t\
    \ moving for him.\n\n“See you tomorrow?” Mara asked. It wasn’t flirtation. It\
    \ was the simple hunger for another adult to confirm that days continued.\n\n\
    Teddy surprised himself. “If I survive the alley.”\n\nMara smiled, wide and tired.\
    \ “If you don’t, I’ll name the next one Theodore.”\n\nHe walked on before he could\
    \ respond to that, because his throat had gone small.\n\nThe alley smelled like\
    \ old rain and coffee grounds. Someone had planted sunflowers in a five-gallon\
    \ paint bucket, and they leaned over the fence as if eavesdropping. A cat darted\
    \ between bins and paused to judge him.\n\nHe kept his pace steady, but his eyes\
    \ had to work harder. There were no familiar cracks to step over. No bench to\
    \ touch. The world did not meet him halfway.\n\nHalfway down, he passed a garage\
    \ with its door half-open. Inside, a man stood with a table saw, measuring carefully.\
    \ Sawdust hung in the air like pollen.\n\n“Morning,” the man called out, without\
    \ looking up.\n\nTeddy’s mouth answered on reflex. “Morning.”\n\nThe man glanced\
    \ over, then grinned. “You’re the walker. I see you out front every day.”\n\n\
    Teddy stopped. “You—”\n\n“Devon,” the man supplied, wiping his hands on his jeans.\
    \ “We bought the Kline place. Well, ‘bought’ is generous. We’re trying to persuade\
    \ it not to fall down.”\n\nTeddy looked back the way he’d come, thinking of Mrs.\
    \ Kline’s curtains twitching at 6:27, whether she was home or not. Mrs. Kline\
    \ had moved to her daughter’s months ago. The curtains twitched now because a\
    \ ceiling fan did.\n\n“Looks like you’re doing a good job,” Teddy said, and heard\
    \ how thin it sounded. Compliments were usually deliveries: noticed, acknowledged,\
    \ moved on.\n\nDevon nodded toward the alley. “They got your sidewalk all torn\
    \ up?”\n\n“Six months,” Teddy said.\n\nDevon made a sympathetic face. “That’s\
    \ rough. You want coffee? I’m taking a break. Got one of those fancy makers in\
    \ the house. My wife says we’re gentrifying ourselves.”\n\nTeddy almost said no.\
    \ Almost, because no was safer. No meant he could keep moving, keep the morning\
    \ from turning into something else.\n\nBut the alley had already done what it\
    \ did: it had removed the props. Without his bench, without Lena’s thermos voice,\
    \ there was only the raw fact of being awake.\n\nHe thought of his house at 6:23,\
    \ the lemon in the bowl, the paper squared under fruit that never ripened. He\
    \ thought of how he’d walked the same three miles because if he kept the street\
    \ the same, maybe the ache would stay in its lane too.\n\nIn Devon’s garage, the\
    \ sawdust caught the light like tiny planets.\n\n“Coffee,” Teddy heard himself\
    \ say. He cleared his throat, pretended it was about the drink. “Sure. Long as\
    \ it’s not one of those… foamy situations.”\n\nDevon laughed. “No foam. Just caffeine\
    \ and regret.”\n\nAs Teddy stepped into the unfamiliar house behind the unfamiliar\
    \ alley, he realized something with a mild, almost comic shock: his route had\
    \ never taken him inside anyone else’s morning.\n\nHe’d known every crack in the\
    \ sidewalk. He’d never known what happened behind the doors.\n\nThe detour, it\
    \ turned out, wasn’t just around broken concrete. It was around the careful perimeter\
    \ he’d drawn to keep loss from spilling.\n\nOutside, somewhere beyond the trench,\
    \ the sycamore bench waited alone. Teddy pictured it in his mind, then let the\
    \ image go, like a letter finally dropped in the slot."

  content: "# STORY CRITIQUE\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: Character Interiority**\n\n**SCORE:\
    \ 0.80**\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Strong example: \"Not because he had to. Because\
    \ the street did.\" & \"His stomach tightened with something that wasn't fear\
    \ exactly. More like… reluctance to be surprised.\"\n- Weaker example: \"He thought\
    \ of his house at 6:23, the lemon in the bowl, the paper squared under fruit that\
    \ never ripened. He thought of how he'd walked the same three miles because if\
    \ he kept the street the same, maybe the ache would stay in its lane too.\"\n\n\
    **FEEDBACK:** \nTeddy's interiority is rich in *action* (what he does/feels) but\
    \ occasionally slips into *summary* (explaining why). The paragraph beginning\
    \ \"He thought of his house...\" tells us his motivation explicitly rather than\
    \ trusting the reader to infer it from his compulsive behavior. \n\n**Improvement:**\
    \ Replace the explanation with sensory/behavioral detail. Instead of stating he\
    \ walks to contain his grief, show a moment where he nearly breaks routine—maybe\
    \ his foot hovers over the lemon in the bowl one morning, and he forcibly sets\
    \ it back down. Let readers experience the rigidity directly.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION:\
    \ Constraint Satisfaction**\n\n**SCORE: 1.0**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n1. ✓ Routine detail:\
    \ \"At 6:10 every morning, Teddy's kettle clicked off. At 6:12, he folded the\
    \ paper into thirds...\" (specific, loving, temporal)\n2. ✓ Disruption reveals\
    \ avoidance: \"the careful perimeter he'd drawn to keep loss from spilling\" -\
    \ directly names what the detour exposes\n3. ✓ Neighbor intersection: Mara & Devon\
    \ both know him, see him, reflect him back to himself\n4. ✓ Absence through presence:\
    \ Lena's thermos, her voice, her teasing, the twitching curtains she'd prompt\n\
    5. ✓ New path offers: \"his route had never taken him inside anyone else's morning\"\
    \ - connection and interiority where before there was only external ritual\n\n\
    **FEEDBACK:** \nAll constraints are satisfied cleanly and integrated naturally.\
    \ No improvement needed here.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: Beat Execution**\n\n**SCORE:\
    \ 0.85**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- YOU (comfort): Opening four paragraphs establish\
    \ sidewalk as predictable, knowable world\n- NEED: \"On Tuesday, the planet moved\"\
    \ - sign appears, route blocked\n- GO: \"The alley smelled like old rain and coffee\
    \ grounds\" - unfamiliar territory entered\n- SEARCH: Meeting Devon, accepting\
    \ coffee, stepping inside the house\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\nThe beats are clearly hit,\
    \ but the transition from GO to SEARCH feels slightly rushed. Devon appears quite\
    \ suddenly (\"Morning,\" the man called out). We could spend two more sentences\
    \ in Teddy's resistance before Devon breaks through—maybe Teddy stops, considering\
    \ turning back? This would heighten the significance of the choice to accept coffee.\n\
    \n**Improvement:** Add a moment of hesitation before Teddy responds to Devon.\
    \ Show him physically halting or considering retreat, making his eventual acceptance\
    \ feel like genuine risk rather than narrative momentum.\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION:\
    \ Subtlety**\n\n**SCORE: 0.80**\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Subtle: Mrs. Kline's curtains\
    \ twitching \"whether she was home or not\" → later reveal that a ceiling fan\
    \ causes it now (shows loss through shifted cause, not statement)\n- Subtle: The\
    \ baby"

  content: 'Theodore Washington could tell the season by the sound his shoes made
    on Kercheval Avenue.


    In January, the sidewalk rang hard as a dinner plate. In April, it gave back a
    soft, damp hush, as if the concrete had learned to listen. Remembering it was
    a kind of map he carried in his feet.


    At 6:10 every morning, Teddy’s kettle clicked off. At 6:12, he folded the paper
    into thirds—he didn’t read it so much as square it up—and slid it under the fruit
    bowl that still held nothing but a single, obedient lemon. At 6:18, he put on
    the same gray windbreaker with the torn inner pocket and patted that pocket twice,
    as if checking for mail that wasn’t there anymore.


    Some mornings his fingers drifted, without permission, to the second hook by the
    door—empty now, the wood rubbed smooth where Lena’s coat used to hang. He’d tap
    the hook once, as if it might answer, then drop his hand like he’d been caught
    stealing.


    He left the house at 6:23 on the dot. Not because he had to. Because the street
    did.


    The first crack in the sidewalk—two inches, jagged like lightning—lived three
    doors down. He stepped over it without looking. He tipped his chin to Mrs. Kline’s
    curtains at 6:27, because that was when they twitched, whether she was home or
    not. Past the vacant lot where a pear tree kept trying to be a pear tree and mostly
    succeeded. Past the house with the new blue paint that was too cheerful for Detroit
    before breakfast.


    He knew who took their trash out late, who set it out early, who put the bin out
    and forgot to bring it back until Thursday like a confession. He knew which porch
    light flickered in a way that meant the bulb was fine but the wiring was not.
    He knew that the man on Marlborough always coughed twice before opening his door.


    Forty years on a route will do that to you: turn time into something you can predict,
    like a bus schedule.


    At the corner of Alter, he always paused at the bench under the sycamore. Not
    to sit—he didn’t trust himself to sit. Just to rest his palm on the backrest,
    cold or warm depending, and let his breath fall into rhythm. A small, private
    touchpoint. Proof, maybe, that he was still on the same planet.


    His wife, Lena, used to tease him about it. “You’re gonna wear a groove in the
    air,” she’d say, sliding his thermos into his hand like a baton. After she died,
    the thermos stayed. The voice didn’t.


    On Tuesday, the planet moved.


    The orange sign appeared overnight as if delivered by an especially humorless
    stork: **SIDEWALK CLOSED—CONSTRUCTION—6 MONTHS**. Beneath it, a row of sawhorses
    cut his route in half. Beyond them, the familiar sidewalk was already broken open,
    the concrete’s innards exposed in a trench.


    Teddy stood at the barricade long enough to make a stranger walking a dog glance
    at him, then glance at the trench, as if wondering whether Teddy planned to jump.


    Six months. The number sat in his chest like an unsent letter.


    He did what he’d always done when something didn’t make sense: he looked for the
    person responsible. There was no foreman, no clipboard, no one to complain to.
    Just a backhoe parked like a sleeping animal and the smell of wet dirt.


    He tried, briefly, to take it as a joke. “Six months,” he showed the sign his
    palm, as if it might laugh with him. The sign did not.


    Behind him, a door clicked. A young woman stepped out of the newly painted blue
    house, pulling a knit cap down over her ears. She held a baby against her chest
    in a carrier. The baby wore a tiny striped hat and stared at Teddy with a frankness
    that would’ve offended an adult.


    “You walk every morning,” she said—not asking, stating, like she’d been watching
    from behind those too-cheerful curtains.


    “Have for a while,” Teddy said. He meant: longer than you’ve lived anywhere. He
    didn’t say it.


    “They’re doing this for months,” she said. “I asked. They said ‘maybe sooner’
    the way people say ‘maybe’ when they mean ‘no.’”


    Teddy eyed the baby. “You bring a supervisor?”


    She snorted, surprising a little laugh out of herself. “This is Mara. She’s in
    charge of naps and making me question every decision I’ve ever made.”


    The baby’s gaze stayed on him, unblinking. Teddy felt, absurdly, inspected.


    “Well,” he said, because the words *I don’t know where to go* felt too naked.
    “Guess I’ll have to detour.”


    Mara shifted her weight, rocking without thinking. “There’s an alley behind those
    houses,” she offered, jerking her chin. “It’s… not pretty.”


    Teddy looked where she pointed. The alley was the kind of place he’d avoided on
    principle for decades. A narrow strip of cracked asphalt, lined with trash bins
    and the backs of garages. No porches. No curtains. No predictable human rituals—just
    the private mess people hid from the street.


    His stomach tightened with something that wasn’t fear exactly. More like… reluctance
    to be surprised.


    He nodded anyway. The sign wasn’t moving for him.


    “See you tomorrow?” Mara asked. It wasn’t flirtation. It was the simple hunger
    for another adult to confirm that days continued.


    Teddy surprised himself. “If I survive the alley.”


    Mara smiled, wide and tired. “If you don’t, I’ll name the next one Theodore.”


    He walked on before he could respond to that, because his throat had gone small.


    The alley smelled like old rain and coffee grounds. Someone had planted sunflowers
    in a five-gallon paint bucket, and they leaned over the fence as if eavesdropping.
    A cat darted between bins and paused to judge him.


    He kept his pace steady, but his eyes had to work harder. There were no familiar
    cracks to step over. No bench to touch. The world did not meet him halfway.


    Halfway down, a garage door stood half-open. Inside, a man hovered over a table
    saw, measuring carefully. Sawdust hung in the air like pollen.


    Teddy slowed without meaning to. The alley narrowed here; he could pass, pretend
    he hadn’t seen. His foot drifted toward the edge of the pavement where a strip
    of mud waited—messy, avoidable. He imagined himself turning around, telling Mara
    with a shrug that he’d “figure something else out,” which would mean staying home,
    circling his block, staring at that lemon like it was an instruction.


    A board thumped lightly as the man set it down.


    “Morning,” the man called out, still not looking up.


    Teddy’s mouth answered on reflex, late by half a beat. “Morning.”


    The man glanced over, then grinned. “You’re the walker. I see you out front every
    day.”


    Teddy stopped fully now, caught between forward and back. “You—”


    “Devon,” the man supplied, wiping his hands on his jeans. “We bought the Kline
    place. Well, ‘bought’ is generous. We’re trying to persuade it not to fall down.”


    Teddy looked back the way he’d come, thinking of Mrs. Kline’s curtains twitching
    at 6:27, whether she was home or not. Mrs. Kline had moved to her daughter’s months
    ago. The curtains twitched now because a ceiling fan did.


    “Looks like you’re doing a good job,” Teddy said, and heard how thin it sounded.
    Compliments were usually deliveries: noticed, acknowledged, moved on.


    Devon nodded toward the alley. “They got your sidewalk all torn up?”


    “Six months,” Teddy said.


    Devon made a sympathetic face. “That’s rough. You want coffee? I’m taking a break.
    Got one of those fancy makers in the house. My wife says we’re gentrifying ourselves.”


    Teddy’s hand went, without consulting him, to the torn inner pocket of his windbreaker.
    He patted it once, then again—empty. The habit landed with a dullness, like knocking
    on a door you knew wouldn’t open.


    He could say no. He could keep moving, keep the morning a straight line. He could
    get back to the bench that wasn’t there and the hook by the door that didn’t hold
    anything.


    Instead, he watched the sawdust in the slant of light and thought, with a mild,
    almost comic resentment, that the alley had opinions. It was making room for things.


    “Coffee,” Teddy heard himself say. He cleared his throat, pretended it was about
    the drink. “Sure. Long as it’s not one of those… foamy situations.”


    Devon laughed. “No foam. Just caffeine and regret.”


    As Teddy stepped into the unfamiliar house behind the unfamiliar alley, he realized
    something with a small shock: his route had never taken him inside anyone else’s
    morning.


    He’d known every crack in the sidewalk. He’d never known what happened behind
    the doors.


    Outside, somewhere beyond the trench, the sycamore bench waited alone. Teddy pictured
    his palm on its backrest—then, as Devon held the door, he let the image go, like
    a letter finally dropped in the slot.'

  content: 'Theodore Washington could tell the season by the sound his shoes made
    on Kercheval Avenue.


    In January, the sidewalk rang hard as a dinner plate. In April, it gave back a
    soft, damp hush, as if the concrete had learned to listen. Remembering it was
    a kind of map he carried in his feet.


    At 6:10 every morning, Teddy’s kettle clicked off. At 6:12, he folded the paper
    into thirds—he didn’t read it so much as square it up—and slid it under the fruit
    bowl that still held nothing but a single, obedient lemon. At 6:18, he put on
    the same gray windbreaker with the torn inner pocket and patted that pocket twice,
    as if checking for mail that wasn’t there anymore.


    Some mornings his fingers drifted, without permission, to the second hook by the
    door—empty now, the wood rubbed smooth where Lena’s coat used to hang. He’d tap
    the hook once, as if it might answer, then drop his hand like he’d been caught
    stealing.


    A few doors down lived Mr. Alvarez, who always opened his garage at 6:25 and waved
    too hard, like he was trying to flag down a train.


    “Morning, Ted!” he’d call.


    Teddy would lift two fingers. He could stop. He could accept the standing offer—coffee,
    talk about baseball, complain about taxes like grown men were meant to. Sometimes
    he even slowed, just enough to feel the tug of it.


    Then he’d speed up again, as if the air had teeth.


    If he let himself linger, someone might ask him how he was doing, and his mouth
    might answer honestly. The honest answer had edges. It didn’t fit into a morning.


    He left the house at 6:23 on the dot. Not because he had to. Because the street
    did.


    The first crack in the sidewalk—two inches, jagged like lightning—lived three
    doors down. He stepped over it without looking. He tipped his chin to Mrs. Kline’s
    curtains at 6:27, because that was when they twitched, whether she was home or
    not. Past the vacant lot where a pear tree kept trying to be a pear tree and mostly
    succeeded. Past the house with the new blue paint that was too cheerful for Detroit
    before breakfast.


    He knew who took their trash out late, who set it out early, who put the bin out
    and forgot to bring it back until Thursday like a confession. He knew which porch
    light flickered in a way that meant the bulb was fine but the wiring was not.
    He knew that the man on Marlborough always coughed twice before opening his door.


    At the corner of Alter, he always paused at the bench under the sycamore. Not
    to sit—he didn’t trust himself to sit. Just to rest his palm on the backrest,
    cold or warm depending, and let his breath fall into rhythm. A small, private
    touchpoint. Proof, maybe, that he was still on the same planet.


    His wife, Lena, used to tease him about it. “You’re gonna wear a groove in the
    air,” she’d say, sliding his thermos into his hand like a baton. After she died,
    the thermos stayed. The voice didn’t.


    On Tuesday, the planet moved.


    The orange sign appeared overnight as if delivered by an especially humorless
    stork: **SIDEWALK CLOSED—CONSTRUCTION—6 MONTHS**. Beneath it, a row of sawhorses
    cut his route in half. Beyond them, the familiar sidewalk was already broken open,
    the concrete’s innards exposed in a trench.


    Teddy stood at the barricade long enough to make a stranger walking a dog glance
    at him, then glance at the trench, as if wondering whether Teddy planned to jump.


    Six months. The number sat in his chest like an unsent letter.


    He looked for the person responsible. No foreman, no clipboard. Just a backhoe
    parked like a sleeping animal and the smell of wet dirt.


    He tried, briefly, to take it as a joke. “Six months,” he showed the sign his
    palm, as if it might laugh with him. The sign did not.


    Behind him, a door clicked. A young woman stepped out of the newly painted blue
    house, pulling a knit cap down over her ears. She held a baby against her chest
    in a carrier. The baby wore a tiny striped hat and stared at Teddy with a frankness
    that would’ve offended an adult.


    “You walk every morning,” she said—not asking, stating, like she’d been watching
    from behind those too-cheerful curtains.


    “Have for a while,” Teddy said.


    “They’re doing this for months,” she said. “I asked. They said ‘maybe sooner’
    the way people say ‘maybe’ when they mean ‘no.’”


    Teddy eyed the baby. “You bring a supervisor?”


    She snorted, surprising a little laugh out of herself. “This is Mara. She’s in
    charge of naps and making me question every decision I’ve ever made.”


    The baby’s gaze stayed on him, unblinking. Teddy felt, absurdly, inspected.


    “Well,” he said, because the words *I don’t know where to go* felt too naked.
    “Guess I’ll have to detour.”


    Mara shifted her weight, rocking without thinking. “There’s an alley behind those
    houses,” she offered, jerking her chin. “It’s… not pretty.”


    Teddy looked where she pointed. The alley was the kind of place he’d avoided on
    principle for decades. No porches. No curtains. No clean front-facing lives.


    His stomach tightened with something that wasn’t fear exactly. More like reluctance
    to be surprised.


    He nodded anyway. The sign wasn’t moving for him.


    “See you tomorrow?” Mara asked, and it sounded like she was asking the day itself
    to show up.


    Teddy surprised himself. “If I survive the alley.”


    Mara smiled, wide and tired. “If you don’t, I’ll name the next one Theodore.”


    He walked on before he could respond to that, because his throat had gone small.


    The alley smelled like old rain and coffee grounds. Someone had planted sunflowers
    in a five-gallon paint bucket, and they leaned over a fence as if eavesdropping.
    A cat darted between bins and paused to judge him.


    He kept his pace steady, but his eyes had to work harder. There were no familiar
    cracks to step over. No bench to touch. The world did not meet him halfway.


    Halfway down, a garage door stood half-open. Inside, a man hovered over a table
    saw, measuring carefully. Sawdust hung in the air like pollen.


    Teddy slowed without meaning to. He could pass. He could keep the alley as merely
    another stretch of sidewalk—no names, no invitations. His foot drifted toward
    the edge of the pavement where a strip of mud waited—messy, avoidable—like a little
    punishment for leaving the rules.


    A board thumped lightly as the man set it down.


    “Morning,” the man called out, still not looking up.


    Teddy’s mouth answered on reflex, late by half a beat. “Morning.”


    The man glanced over, then grinned. “You’re the walker. I see you out front every
    day.”


    Teddy stopped fully now, caught between forward and back. “You—”


    “Devon,” the man supplied, wiping his hands on his jeans. “We bought the Kline
    place. Well, ‘bought’ is generous. We’re trying to persuade it not to fall down.”


    Teddy looked back the way he’d come, thinking of Mrs. Kline’s curtains twitching
    at 6:27. Mrs. Kline had moved to her daughter’s months ago. The curtains twitched
    now because a ceiling fan did.


    Devon nodded toward the alley. “They got your sidewalk all torn up?”


    “Six months,” Teddy said.


    “That’s rough. You want coffee? I’m taking a break. Got one of those fancy makers
    in the house. My wife says we’re gentrifying ourselves.”


    Teddy’s hand went, without consulting him, to the torn inner pocket of his windbreaker.
    He patted it once, then again—empty. The habit landed with a dullness, like knocking
    on a door you knew wouldn’t open.


    In his head, Lena’s voice rose up—not memory, not quite, more like the shape she
    used to make in him. *Don’t be stubborn, Teddy. People won’t bite unless you ask
    ’em to.*


    He almost argued with the ghost. He almost said no to prove he could.


    Instead, he watched the sawdust in the slant of light and felt, underneath the
    annoyance, the bigger thing: a thin, specific terror that one day he would walk
    these streets and no one would call him anything at all—not “walker,” not “Mr.
    Washington,” not even “hey you”—just a man moving through a neighborhood that
    had learned to live without him.


    “Coffee,” he heard himself say. He cleared his throat, pretended it was about
    the drink. “Sure. Long as it’s not one of those… foamy situations.”


    Devon laughed. “No foam. Just caffeine and regret.”


    Inside, the house smelled of fresh plaster and toast. There were voices in another
    room—'

    In January, the sidewalk rang hard as a dinner plate. In April, it gave back a
    soft, damp hush, as if the concrete had learned to listen. Remembering it was
    a kind of map he carried in his feet.


    At 6:10 every morning, Teddy’s kettle clicked off. At 6:12, he folded the paper
    into thirds—he didn’t read it so much as square it up—and slid it under the fruit
    bowl that still held nothing but a single, obedient lemon. At 6:18, he put on
    the same gray windbreaker with the torn inner pocket and patted that pocket twice,

    Teddy would lift two fingers. He could stop. He could accept the standing offer—coffee,
    talk about baseball, complain about taxes like grown men were meant to. Sometimes
    he even slowed, just enough to feel the tug of it.


    Then he’d speed up again, as if the air had teeth.


    If he let himself linger, someone might ask him how he was doing, and his mouth
    might answer honestly. The honest answer had edges. It didn’t fit into a morning.
    Better to keep moving, to be the man everyone could count on to pass by at 6:23,
    steady as streetlights.


    He left the house at 6:23 on the dot. Not because he had to. Because the street
    did.


    The first crack in the sidewalk—two inches, jagged like lightning—lived three
    doors down. He stepped over it without looking. He tipped his chin to Mrs. Kline’s
    curtains at 6:27, because that was when they twitched, whether she was home or
    not. Past the vacant lot where a pear tree kept trying to be a pear tree and mostly
    succeeded. Past the house with the new blue paint that was too cheerful for Detroit
    before breakfast.


    At the corner of Alter, he always paused at the bench under the sycamore. Not
    to sit—he didn’t trust himself to sit. Just to rest his palm on the backrest,
    cold or warm depending, and let his breath fall into rhythm.


    His wife, Lena, used to tease him about it. “You’re gonna wear a groove in the
    air,” she’d say, sliding his thermos into his hand like a baton. After she died,
    the thermos stayed. The voice didn’t.


    On Tuesday, the planet moved.


    The orange sign appeared overnight as if delivered by an especially humorless
    stork: **SIDEWALK CLOSED—CONSTRUCTION—6 MONTHS**. Beneath it, a row of sawhorses
    cut his route in half. Beyond them, the familiar sidewalk was already broken open,
    the concrete’s innards exposed in a trench.


    Teddy stood there long enough to make a stranger walking a dog glance at him,
    then glance at the trench, as if wondering whether Teddy planned to jump.


    Six months. The number sat in his chest like an unsent letter.


    He looked for the person responsible. No foreman, no clipboard. Just a backhoe
    parked like a sleeping animal and the smell of wet dirt. The street—his street—had
    changed without asking him, the way illness had, the way death had. His routine
    had been built for exactly this: to make sure nothing surprised him again. And
    here it was, surprise in orange plastic.


    Behind him, a door clicked. A young woman stepped out of the newly painted blue
    house, pulling a knit cap down over her ears. She held a baby against her chest
    in a carrier. The baby wore a tiny striped hat and stared at Teddy with a frankness
    that would’ve offended an adult.


    “You walk every morning,” she said—not asking, stating, like she’d been watching
    from behind those too-cheerful curtains.


    “Have for a while,” Teddy said.


    “They’re doing this for months,” she said. “I asked. They said ‘maybe sooner’
    the way people say ‘maybe’ when they mean ‘no.’”


    Teddy eyed the baby. “You bring a supervisor?”


    She snorted, surprising a little laugh out of herself. “This is Mara. She’s in
    charge of naps and making me question every decision I’ve ever made.”


    The baby’s gaze stayed on him, unblinking. Teddy felt, absurdly, inspected.


    “Well,” he said, because the words *I don’t know where to go* felt too naked.
    “Guess I’ll have to detour.”


    “There’s an alley behind those houses,” Mara offered, jerking her chin. “It’s…
    not pretty.”


    Teddy looked where she pointed. The alley was the kind of place he’d avoided on
    principle for decades. No porches. No curtains. No clean front-facing lives.


    His stomach tightened with something that wasn’t fear exactly. More like reluctance
    to be surprised.


    He nodded anyway.


    “See you tomorrow?” Mara asked, and it sounded like she was asking the day itself
    to show up.


    Teddy surprised himself. “If I survive the alley.”


    Mara smiled, wide and tired. “If you don’t, I’ll name the next one Theodore.”


    He walked on before he could respond to that, because his throat had gone small.


    The alley smelled like old rain and coffee grounds. Someone had planted sunflowers
    in a five-gallon paint bucket, and they leaned over a fence as if eavesdropping.
    A cat darted between bins and paused to judge him.


    Halfway down, a garage door stood half-open. Inside, a man hovered over a table
    saw, measuring carefully. Sawdust hung in the air like pollen.


    Teddy slowed without meaning to. He could pass. He could keep the alley as merely
    another stretch of pavement—no names, no invitations. His foot drifted toward
    the edge where a strip of mud waited—messy, avoidable—like a little punishment
    for leaving the rules.


    A board thumped lightly as the man set it down.


    “Morning,” the man called out.


    Teddy’s mouth answered on reflex, late by half a beat. “Morning.”


    The man glanced over, then grinned. “You’re the walker. I see you out front every
    day.”


    Teddy stopped fully now, caught between forward and back. “You—”


    “Devon,” the man supplied, wiping his hands on his jeans. “We bought the Kline
    place. Well, ‘bought’ is generous. We’re trying to persuade it not to fall down.”


    Teddy looked back the way he’d come, thinking of Mrs. Kline’s curtains twitching
    at 6:27. Mrs. Kline had moved to her daughter’s months ago. The curtains twitched
    now because a ceiling fan did.


    Devon nodded toward the alley. “They got your sidewalk all torn up?”


    “Six months,” Teddy said.


    “That’s rough. You want coffee? I’m taking a break. Got one of those fancy makers
    in the house. My wife says we’re gentrifying ourselves.”


    Teddy’s hand went, without consulting him, to the torn inner pocket of his windbreaker.
    He patted it once, then again—empty. The habit landed with a dullness, like knocking
    on a door you knew wouldn’t open.


    In his head, Lena’s voice rose up—not memory, not quite, more like the shape she
    used to make in him. *Don’t be stubborn, Teddy. People won’t bite unless you ask
    ’em to.*


    He almost argued with the ghost. He almost said no to prove he could.


    Instead, he heard himself say, “Coffee. Sure. Long as it’s not one of those… foamy
    situations.”


    Devon laughed. “No foam. Just caffeine and regret.”


    Inside, the house smelled of fresh plaster and toast. A woman in paint-splattered
    sweatpants turned from the counter, holding a mug and a small jar of screws like
    it was a second cup.


    “This must be Theodore,” she said. “Devon’s been talking about ‘the walker’ like
    you’re a neighborhood legend.”


    Teddy opened his mouth and, for once, didn’t have a pre-stamped reply. The honest
    answer pressed up—sharp, inconvenient—and he swallowed it down as carefully as
    hot coffee.


    “Just Teddy,” he managed.


    Devon’s wife slid him a mug. No foam. Strong enough to make him blink. She set
    the jar of screws beside it. “We’re missing the tiny ones. The ones that look
    like nothing and turn out to be everything.”


    Teddy looked at the jar. In his mind, his old bench waited under the sycamore.
    In his hand, the mug warmed his fingers. He realized—quietly, without drama—that
    his route had always'

  In January, the sidewalk rang hard as a dinner plate. In April, it gave back a soft,
  damp hush, as if the concrete had learned to listen. Remembering it was a kind of
  map he carried in his feet.


  At 6:10 every morning, Teddy’s kettle clicked off. At 6:12, he folded the paper
  into thirds—he didn’t read it so much as square it up—and slid it under the fruit
  bowl that still held nothing but a single, obedient lemon. At 6:18, he put on the
  same gray windbreaker with the torn inner pocket and patted that pocket twice, as
  if checking for mail that wasn’t there anymore.


  Some mornings his fingers drifted, without permission, to the second hook by the
  door—empty now, the wood rubbed smooth where Lena’s coat used to hang. He’d tap
  the hook once, as if it might answer, then drop his hand like he’d been caught stealing.


  A few doors down lived Mr. Alvarez, who always opened his garage at 6:25 and waved
  too hard, like he was trying to flag down a train.


  “Morning, Ted!” he’d call.


  Teddy would lift two fingers. He could stop. He could accept the standing offer—coffee,
  talk about baseball, complain about taxes like grown men were meant to. Sometimes
  he even slowed, just enough to feel the tug of it.
