  evidence: 'VERSION 0 establishes Elena''s competence through concrete, specific
    actions (clearing backlog, securing ventilators) with strong metaphorical language
    (''conductor,'' ''indispensable''). The opening is solid but generic in places.
    VERSION 3 dramatically sharpens this through active verb choice (''vectored''
    vs ''moved''), more precise technical language (''live-updating map of bed counts
    and staff ratios''), and stronger metaphors (''central processing unit,'' ''vital
    organ kept in a jar''). The revision maintains all competence beats while making
    them more visceral. The final output fully satisfies all constraints: (1) Elena''s
    competence is extensively demonstrated before her flaw emerges—she''s the hospital''s
    operational heart, solving complex logistics problems with authority; (2) the
    friendship with Arthur feels earned through specific, intimate moments (the cyanosis
    detail, the cannula adjustment, the Coltrane conversation) rather than told; (3)
    her transformation is purely internal—she remains at her desk, still efficient,
    but now *aware* of what she''s sacrificed, creating genuine ambiguity about whether
    this awareness constitutes real change; (4) peripheral cyanosis is a specific,
    medically accurate detail that serves narrative function (signals Arthur''s respiratory
    distress, justifies Elena''s intervention, demonstrates her clinical eye); (5)
    the ending is masterfully ambiguous—''wondering if the connection she''d felt
    had actually changed her, or if she was simply waiting for the fever to break''
    leaves her transformation unresolved. The trajectory shows consistent improvement:
    V0→V3 gains precision in language, stronger metaphorical coherence, more nuanced
    characterization, and better integration of the medical detail. The glass office,
    the empty chest metaphor, and the final hesitation at the keyboard all work together
    to create a psychologically complex portrait of someone glimpsing connection but
    uncertain whether she can sustain it. Minor weakness: the Arthur characterization,
    while touching, could have one additional specific detail to deepen the earned-ness
    of their bond.'
  strengths:
  - Exceptional metaphorical consistency (vector/CPU/organ/machine)
  - Peripheral cyanosis detail is medically accurate and narratively essential
  - Final ambiguity is genuinely unresolved—not a cop-out but earned uncertainty
  - Elena's competence is demonstrated through action, not exposition
  - Internal transformation is subtle and psychologically credible
  - Revision trajectory shows clear improvement in precision and impact
  weaknesses:
  - Arthur's character could use one additional specific detail beyond jazz club ownership
  - The 'fever to break' metaphor at the end, while clever, slightly risks undermining
    the ambiguity
  - Could strengthen the friendship beat with one more concrete shared moment
