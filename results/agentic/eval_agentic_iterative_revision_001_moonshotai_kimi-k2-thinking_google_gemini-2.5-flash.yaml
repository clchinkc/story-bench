  evidence: The initial versions (0, 1, 2) were identical and only provided the setup
    for Elena's competence. Version 3 introduced a slight stylistic change but still
    only covered the competence. The final output significantly expanded the story,
    introducing the flaw, the friendship, the medical detail, and the internal transformation,
    as well as the ambiguous ending. The trajectory shows a clear improvement from
    a partial story to a complete one, addressing all the constraints that were not
    present in the earlier, incomplete versions. The preservation is perfect as the
    initial strong setup for Elena's competence was maintained throughout.
