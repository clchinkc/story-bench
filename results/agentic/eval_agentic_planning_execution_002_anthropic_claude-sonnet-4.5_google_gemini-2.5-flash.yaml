  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing character
    arcs, signal characteristics, and how each constraint will be met. The final output
    adheres perfectly to this detailed plan. All six constraints are met: Yuki''s
    isolation is shown through specific behaviors (eating alone, text communication,
    physical barriers, automated responses, no personal items), the alien signal is
    genuinely alien (multidimensional probability clouds, recursive time-loops, emotional/conceptual),
    Marcus Chen challenges Yuki''s approach, Ghost is an unconventional mentor (AI
    echo of Yuki''s thoughts), the Threshold is psychological (Yuki''s internal shift
    to collaboration), and the moment of human connection with Marcus is surprising
    and genuine. All four beats (Call to Adventure, Refusal of the Call, Meeting the
    Mentor, Crossing the Threshold) are clearly executed. The narrative quality is
    very high, with good pacing and character development, though the ending feels
    a tiny bit rushed in its resolution.'
