  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Shifted from abstract setup to concrete conflict (trembling
    hands, specific deadline). VERSION 1→2: Added mother''s defensive phone dialogue,
    making her struggle visceral rather than reported. VERSION 2→3 (Final): Crystallized
    the grandmother moment as the emotional/thematic pivot. The progression shows
    disciplined constraint satisfaction: (1) Internal conflict shown through physical
    reactions (trembling, stomach twist, throat closing) and competing impulses rather
    than exposition. (2) Grandmother scene is the specific crystallizing moment—the
    photo, the grandfather''s deathbed words, the ''don''t let him carry my ghosts''
    line forces Mateo''s choice. (3) Mrs. Patterson genuinely understands the dilemma
    (success ≠ abandonment), validating his fears while reframing them. (4) Cultural
    elements feel earned: panadería, café de olla, guayabera, ''para el abuelo''—integrated
    into character action, not description. (5) Resolution is earned through Mateo''s
    growth: he moves from paralysis → seeking counsel → family gathering → signed
    letter. The family assembly is the earned moment, not a sudden decision. Preservation
    excellent: opening image maintained, heat metaphor sustained, sister''s voice
    preserved as grounding detail. Mrs. Patterson addition (V3) strengthens without
    disrupting. Minor gap: could show slightly more of Mateo''s internal resistance
    during grandmother scene (one more beat of hesitation before acceptance), but
    the emotional arc is clear and justified.'
