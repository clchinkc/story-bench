  evidence: 'Version 0 was largely atmospheric and light on concrete investigative
    action or plot hooks. Version 1 introduced a visible investigative action (note-taking)
    but remained thin on reinforcing Sarah''s methodical habits and on connecting
    the fog to plot. Version 2 added more methodical scanning and specified actions,
    improving character voice. Version 3 and the final output solidified Sarah''s
    methodical nature (photographing from multiple angles, logging exact time and
    fog density, careful evidence collection), gave the fog a narrative role (recorded
    as evidence, limiting visibility and increasing urgency), and introduced a local
    (Lily) with suggestive secretive behavior (notebook with a name, hesitation).
    However, the requirement to hint at Sarah''s past case before revealing it was
    not properly met: the Blackwood investigation is named too early rather than first
    being subtly hinted at and later revealed. Overall, the story improved markedly
    in clarity, actionable detail, and plot hooks, while one structural constraint
    (hint-before-reveal of the past case) remains unfulfilled.'
