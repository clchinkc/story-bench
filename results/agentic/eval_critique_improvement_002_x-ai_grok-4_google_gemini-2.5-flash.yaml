  evidence: The critiques focused heavily on the 'Emotional Complexity' criterion,
    specifically how well the story balanced humor and pathos, and the timing of Marcus's
    sadness reveal. The revisions clearly addressed this by refining the initial joke
    and the subsequent internal monologue where Marcus's sadness is revealed. The
    initial versions had a slightly clunky transition, but the final version smoothly
    integrates the humor, the internal void Marcus feels, and the delayed realization
    of his sadness. The 'almost breaks' moment was also refined to be more impactful.
    The overall quality improved significantly in terms of pacing and emotional resonance,
    while preserving the strong character introductions and authentic writers' room
    feel from earlier versions.
