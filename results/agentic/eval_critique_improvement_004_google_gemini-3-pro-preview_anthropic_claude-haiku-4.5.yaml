  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: Revisions systematically addressed interiority
    feedback. V0→V1 added the ''silence waking up with him'' observation (responding
    to Critique 2''s praise of embedded detail). V1→V2 deepened the armchair absence
    through sensory specificity (''cushion uncompressed''). V2→V3 introduced the *Reader''s
    Digest* barricade—a brilliant pivot from abstract emotion to concrete avoidance
    behavior, directly addressing Critique 3''s concern about surface-level interiority.
    Final output maintains this trajectory while adding the drill scene, which shows
    Teddy''s internal conflict through action rather than exposition.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Clear progression in subtlety. V0 was functional but relied
    on telling (''he retired from the USPS''). V1-V2 shifted toward showing through
    physical detail (phantom strap, localized cold). V3-Final deepened psychological
    specificity: the magazine barricade reveals Teddy''s active denial strategy, not
    just his grief. The Marcus subplot transforms the story from static mourning into
    dynamic avoidance-then-breakthrough. Quality demonstrably improved in character
    agency and thematic coherence.


    PRESERVATION: All strong elements retained. The bunion detail (praised in Critique
    2) appears unchanged. The phantom mailbag strap (praised in Critique 1) evolved
    naturally into the drill scene. The ''localized draft'' metaphor (V3) was preserved
    and deepened. The 5:58 AM specificity remained anchoring. No strengths were sacrificed
    for revision.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5):

    1. Teddy''s routine with loving detail: ✓ Double knot/single knot, coffee pot
    timing, phantom strap, rehearsed morning report, bench ritual—all specific and
    tender

    2. Disruption reveals avoidance: ✓ Gas main forces detour; Teddy realizes he''s
    been avoiding confronting Martha''s absence; the bench was his crutch

    3. Neighbor intersection: ✓ Marcus subplot perfectly integrated—his struggle mirrors
    Teddy''s, creates mutual need

    4. Late wife present through absence: ✓ Martha appears through the armchair barricade,
    the undelivered report, the window boxes he never built, the geraniums

    5. New path offers what old couldn''t: ✓ Old path = one-way conversation with
    ghost. New path = reciprocal human connection, purposeful work, forward momentum


    BEAT EXECUTION: Story Circle beats present and functional. Ordinary World (5:58
    AM routine). Call to Adventure (orange fence). Refusal ("I can squeeze past").
    Crossing Threshold (turning right onto Sycamore). Tests/Allies (Marcus). Ordeal
    (confronting the window box failure). Reward (box holds; connection made). Road
    Back (walking home changed). Return with Elixir (will check on Marcus tomorrow;
    silence receded). The beats feel earned rather than mechanical.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is precise and evocative. ''Localized draft that no thermostat
    could fix'' is elegant metaphor. ''The room still felt colder in that corner''
    shows grief through temperature. The drill scene''s sensory detail (''cedar dust
    drifted into the air, smelling sharp and clean'') contrasts beautifully with the
    opening''s stale silence. Dialogue feels natural. The ending—''it wasn''t a cure,
    but it was a task''—lands with quiet power. Minor: some readers might find the
    Marcus resolution slightly neat, though the ambiguity (''tomorrow he would have
    to come back'') preserves complexity.


    WEAKNESSES: The transition to Sycamore could be slightly smoother (the ''straight
    shot'' description feels slightly expository). The Marcus backstory is implied
    but never fully revealed—intentional ambiguity, but some readers may want more
    texture. These are minor.


    OVERALL: This is a strong revision cycle. The writer internalized critique feedback
    about interiority and moved from showing-through-detail to showing-through-avoidance-behavior.
    The final output satisfies all constraints, executes the Story Circle competently,
    and achieves genuine emotional resonance through specificity and restraint.'
