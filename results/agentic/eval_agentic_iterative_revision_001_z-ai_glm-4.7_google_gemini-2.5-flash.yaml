  evidence: Quality improved significantly across versions. Version 0 was a barebones
    start. Version 1 and 2 added the 'binary logic' line, which was good for establishing
    her character. Version 3 started to introduce the 'silence' and 'staff parted'
    elements, hinting at her isolation. The final output successfully built upon these,
    adding the personal life element, the medical detail, and the interaction with
    Mr. Gable, leading to a much more complete and nuanced story. The initial strong
    opening was preserved throughout.
