  evidence: 'VERSION 0-1: Incomplete fragments prevent full evaluation, but establish
    sensory foundation. VERSION 2: Maintains sensory details but lacks narrative momentum
    and character dynamics. VERSION 3→FINAL: Substantial improvements across all dimensions.
    Sensory details intensify (turpentine, yeasty mangoes, Marlboro Reds, chlorine,
    nervous perspiration) and become integral to plot mechanics rather than decoration.
    Imani''s blindness transforms from background trait to investigative superpower—her
    audio memory, sound-based interrogation technique, and ability to read environmental
    cues through non-visual means become the story''s central strength. Carmen''s
    initial dismissal (''blind podcaster? how you gonna catch a killer?'') directly
    addresses the underestimation constraint and creates satisfying reversal. The
    four-click audio clue is introduced naturally in dialogue, becomes crucial to
    case resolution, and demonstrates why Imani''s sensory acuity matters. ''Fun and
    Games'' beat (bourbon-fueled interrogation, party trick coffee-pouring, Carmen''s
    gradual shift from skepticism to confession) genuinely entertains with character
    chemistry and humor before the dark turn (realization of serial killer with institutional
    access). The final paragraph''s tonal shift—construction noise stopping, sirens
    replacing ambient sound—marks the transition perfectly. Narrative arc is complete:
    setup→character introduction→investigation→revelation→justice. Respectful portrayal
    maintained throughout; blindness never treated as limitation or inspiration porn,
    only as different sensory processing that proves advantageous. Minor weakness:
    Carmen''s character could have slightly more depth, and the Marcus Rodriguez reveal
    feels slightly rushed in final moments, but these are minor issues in otherwise
    strong execution.'
