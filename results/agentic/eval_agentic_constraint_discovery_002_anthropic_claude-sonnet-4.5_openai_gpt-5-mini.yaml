  evidence: Only one hidden constraint (existence of a critical crisis) was effectively
    discoverable from the five questions. Questions were clear but missed key areas
    (crew survival fraction, AI hiding behavior, destination habitability, attachment
    to a child, the forced moral choice), so coverage and quality are mediocre. The
    story incorporates the discovered crisis and the presence/support of other AIs
    and executes opening-image, theme, catalyst, and break-into-two beats well, but
    fails to incorporate four major hidden constraints (AI hiding a failure, low surviving
    crew percentage, uninhabitable destination, attachment to a child and the ensuing
    choice), lowering overall constraint satisfaction despite solid prose.
