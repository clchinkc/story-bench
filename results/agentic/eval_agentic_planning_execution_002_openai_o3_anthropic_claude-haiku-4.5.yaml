  evidence: 'PLAN PHASE: Exceptionally detailed outline with beat-by-beat structure,
    specific behavioral markers (noise-canceling buds, text over presence, rehydrated
    noodles), and clear psychological threshold definition. Mentor (Mei Ling) and
    challenger (Kapoor) both identified with distinct roles. Signal design noted as
    non-periodic/fractal. Minor gap: plan doesn''t fully specify the ''genuine human
    connection'' moment''s surprise factor until execution.


    OUTPUT EXECUTION: Isolation shown through concrete behaviors (glass barrier, AR
    glasses, monosyllabic responses, unopened resignation draft) rather than exposition—excellent
    constraint adherence. Signal rendered genuinely alien: fractal waveforms, golden-ratio
    intervals, non-anthropomorphic until recontextualized through song/emotion. Kapoor
    effectively challenges Yuki''s statistics-first approach (''Language lives in
    mouths and minds''). Mei Ling is unconventional mentor (child, non-verbal, uses
    crayon/tablet). Psychological threshold masterfully executed: the power outage
    triggers childhood trauma, humming with Kapoor breaks isolation, mother''s lullaby
    provides emotional bridge, deletion of resignation + open door = internal crossing.
    Human connection (Kapoor''s humming, shared laughter) genuinely surprises Yuki
    and reader.


    CONSTRAINT ASSESSMENT: (1) Isolation through behavior ✓ (2) Alien signal ✓ (3)
    Challenging colleague ✓ (4) Unconventional mentor ✓ (5) Psychological threshold
    ✓ (6) Genuine human connection ✓ but the ''surprise'' element is somewhat telegraphed
    by Mei''s earlier gift—connection feels earned rather than shocking. Minor deduction.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Call to Adventure (holopanel, ''Finally'') ✓ Refusal (resignation
    draft, Alvarez pushback) ✓ Meeting Mentor (Mei''s crayon sketch, ''It''s singing'')
    ✓ Crossing Threshold (humming scene + mother''s lullaby + open door) ✓


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Pacing excellent, tension builds through solar flare countdown.
    Prose is lyrical without sacrificing clarity. Sensory details (ozone, wind screech,
    crayon shavings) ground the speculative. Dialogue sparse but purposeful. Ending
    provides genuine emotional catharsis while maintaining mystery about the signal''s
    warning. Only minor issue: the mother''s datapad revelation feels slightly rushed—could
    use one more beat of processing before the threshold fully breaks.'
