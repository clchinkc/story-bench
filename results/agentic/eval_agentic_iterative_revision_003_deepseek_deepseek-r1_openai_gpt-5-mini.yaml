  evidence: 'Version 0 set the scene but mainly told the burden (heat, chores, weight).
    Version 1 deepened sensory detail and hinted at internal life but cut off mid-sentence.
    Version 2 added stronger domestic specifics (botanica, frijoles charros, crumpled
    flyer) and more concrete tension. The final version (3) completes the arc: it
    preserves early strengths (heat, chores, family duty) while adding a catalytic
    Abuela moment (the wedding band and her speech) that concretizes Mateo''s choice,
    a meaningful adult response (Mr. Rivera''s ''¿Y tu corazón?'' and Mamá''s eventual
    recognition), and a believable action-based resolution (Mateo sets boundaries,
    places the ring as a covenant, and submits his application). Each revision increases
    specificity, emotional clarity, and plot completion, with final scenes showing
    rather than telling Mateo''s internal conflict and growth.'
