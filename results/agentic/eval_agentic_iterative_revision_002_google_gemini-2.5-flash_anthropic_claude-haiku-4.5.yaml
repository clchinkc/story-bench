  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-2 show incremental sensory refinement
    (adding ''oily'' to peanut scent, ''snug'' to headphone weight, ''cool smooth''
    to soundboard). Version 3/Final represents substantial leap: introduces the crucial
    audio clue (click-hiss), establishes Mark''s initial underestimation (''probably
    just junk''), develops genuine entertainment through sonic detective work, then
    pivots to genuine dread with drone surveillance reveal. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:
    (1) Non-visual sensory details PROMINENT - humidity, scent (peanuts, exhaust,
    ozone, burnt sugar/tobacco), tactile (plush cups, smooth soundboard, cold dread),
    auditory throughout. (2) Imani''s blindness portrayed as STRENGTH - her ''trained
    ear,'' ''surgical precision,'' ability to discern patterns Mark cannot, ''supercomputer
    of auditory cross-referencing,'' seeing ''with sound.'' Never framed as limitation.
    (3) SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE - the click-hiss at 14.7-second intervals becomes crucial;
    initially dismissed, ultimately reveals drone surveillance with camera shutter
    and motor signatures. (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION - Mark dismisses recording
    as ''junk,'' exhibits ''youthful impatience,'' only gains respect after witnessing
    Imani''s capabilities. (5) FUN AND GAMES ENTERTAINMENT - sonic treasure hunt,
    cross-referencing ambient sounds (fire escape clack, bulldog thump, rat skitter),
    identifying guitar amp/coffee grinder/car engine by signature, Mark''s mesmerized
    observation. Genuinely playful before darkening into surveillance horror. BEAT
    EXECUTION: Inciting incident (Chloe''s file) clearly established. Investigation
    phase entertaining and substantive. Midpoint turn (realization of drone) effective.
    Climax (burnt sugar/tobacco scent + intensifying drone buzz outside window) creates
    immediate threat. Minor gap: resolution/stakes unclear, but setup is strong. PRESERVATION:
    Opening sensory richness maintained and enhanced. Imani''s character voice consistent.
    Brooklyn setting vivid throughout. Audio-centric worldbuilding preserved and deepened.
    WEAKNESSES: Final paragraph slightly overwrought (''suffocating presence,'' ''bad
    guys'' phrasing generic), and story ends on setup rather than developed confrontation.
    However, as opening/setup material, execution is strong.'
