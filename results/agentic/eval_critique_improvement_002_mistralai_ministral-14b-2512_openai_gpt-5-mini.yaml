  evidence: 'Version 0 opened with a promising comic whiteboard gag and a werewolf
    joke but felt flatter on emotional stakes and theme. Subsequent revisions (V1–V3)
    progressively added a clearly articulated theme (spoken by Lena), sharper craft-of-comedy
    details (whiteboard notes, specific rewrite lines, discussion of bombing and crowd
    reaction), and deeper access to Marcus''s interior life. The final draft preserves
    the original humor while introducing Lena as a non-naive foil who both states
    the theme and sees through Marcus, and it places an explicit almost-break moment
    (emotional crack in the hallway) that Marcus masks with quips. Improvements: clearer
    theme placement, stronger show-not-tell about comedy craft, and more explicit
    emotional beats. Remaining gap: the Save the Cat beat structure is suggested in
    places (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Debate, Midpoint-like reveal) but not fully
    or rigorously completed through all required beats (All Is Lost, Break into Three,
    Finale are underdeveloped), hence a moderate beat_execution score.'
