  evidence: The critiques consistently pointed out areas where Zara's voice could
    be more authentically youthful, specifically highlighting phrases that sounded
    too mature. The revisions show a clear effort to address this, incorporating more
    'um,' 'like,' and 'kinda,' and replacing more formal phrasing with colloquialisms
    appropriate for a 12-year-old. For example, 'Most grown-ups had given up' became
    'Most grown-ups were just... done.' and 'Solutions are everywhere if you look'
    became 'Um, see? Like, stuff to fix things is everywhere if you just poke around.'
    This significantly improved the youth_voice without sacrificing the narrative's
    overall quality. The core strengths of the story (worldbuilding, initial setup)
    were preserved while the identified weaknesses were targeted effectively.
