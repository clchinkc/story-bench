  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with clear three-act structure, specific
    day-by-day breakdown, and detailed character arcs. Output adheres closely to plan
    with strong execution of all three beats (Setup: Days 1-2 establishing ritual
    and estrangement; Confrontation: Day 4-5 with recipe book discovery and emotional
    breakthrough; Resolution: Days 6-7 with jesa ceremony and California compromise).
    Narrative quality is high with vivid sensory details, natural dialogue, and earned
    emotional moments. CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS: (1) Food symbolism—SATISFIED: Banchan
    ritual (grief armor), wife''s recipes (unchangeable memory), japchae cooking together
    (healing), doenjang jjigae modification (acceptance). (2) Implicit grief—SATISFIED:
    Conveyed through ritual, hesitation with two cups, altar discovery, shaking hands,
    three years of tears. (3) Specific estrangement cause—SATISFIED: David missed
    Sarah''s wedding, chose restaurant over her life, refused to acknowledge her California
    existence. (4) Regular customer—SATISFIED: Mrs. Chen represents community memory
    and contrasts David''s paralysis with her adaptation. (5) Hopeful but realistic
    ending—SATISFIED: ''One month...then we''ll see'' avoids false resolution; they''re
    moving forward but uncertainty remains. (6) Korean cultural element beyond food—PARTIALLY
    SATISFIED: Jesa ceremony is present and meaningful, but feels somewhat secondary
    to food symbolism. The plan mentions ''jesa'' but the execution could have deepened
    this element further (e.g., more detail on ritual significance, traditional elements).
    MINOR GAPS: The Korean cultural constraint is met but not as robustly as other
    elements. The jesa ceremony appears late and could have been woven earlier. Mrs.
    Chen''s character, while functional, could have had slightly more development
    to fully embody her symbolic role as a mirror of David''s potential future.'
