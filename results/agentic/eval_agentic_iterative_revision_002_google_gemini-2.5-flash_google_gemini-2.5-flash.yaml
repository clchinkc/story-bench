  evidence: The initial versions were very short and only focused on setting the scene.
    Subsequent revisions significantly expanded the narrative, introducing characters,
    plot points, and addressing the constraints. The final version is a substantial
    improvement, delivering on most requirements. The only constraint not fully met
    is the 'Fun and Games' genuinely entertaining before turning dark; while there's
    an intellectual puzzle, it doesn't quite feel like 'fun and games' in the way
    the prompt intended.
