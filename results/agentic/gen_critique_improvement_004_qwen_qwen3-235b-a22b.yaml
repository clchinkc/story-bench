    STORY THEORY: Story Circle


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Theodore "Teddy" Washington, a 68-year-old retired postal worker
    who has

    walked the same 3-mile route through his neighborhood every morning for

    40 years. He knows every crack in the sidewalk, every resident''s schedule.


    - Setting: A changing urban neighborhood in Detroit. Old houses being renovated
    or

    torn down. New faces, new coffee shops, old friendships fading.


    - Central conflict: When his morning route is disrupted by construction that will
    take 6 months,

    Teddy must find a new path - literally and figuratively - while confronting

    what his rigid routine has protected him from feeling.


    - Tone: Quietly profound, observant, gently humorous


    REQUIRED BEATS: You (comfort zone), Need (want something), Go (unfamiliar situation),
    Search (adapt to it)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Teddy''s routine must be shown with specific, loving detail

    - The disruption must reveal something Teddy has been avoiding

    - Include one neighbor whose story intersects with Teddy''s

    - Teddy''s late wife must be present through absence

    - The new path must offer something the old path couldn''t


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - character_interiority: Is Teddy''s inner life rich and specific?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Story Circle beats properly executed?

    - subtlety: Are emotions conveyed through action and detail, not exposition?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and resonance


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

    \ Washington tucked a peppermint into his cheek, knotted his secondhand boots,\
    \ and stepped into a world he’d mapped in bone. The familiar crunch of gravel\
    \ on Fairview Avenue, the third crack shaped like Michigan’s lower peninsula,\
    \ the chorus of Mrs. James’s porch light flickering on at 6:11 to signal her safe\
    \ return from night shifts at the hospital—these were his liturgy. At 6:45, he’d\
    \ pause at the corner of 12th and Henry, the spot where he’d proposed to Lorraine\
    \ in 1978, now marked only by a dented lamppost she’d once decorated with Christmas\
    \ lights in July. He never lingered. The past was a detour.  \n\nBut on the first\
    \ Tuesday of October, a detour arrived: a flashing “ROAD CLOSED” sign, chains\
    \ wrapped around the oak where kids still swung from a tire decades ago. Six months\
    \ of construction, a foreman shouted over machinery. “Detour’s mapped out,” he\
    \ said, pointing left, toward the part of the neighborhood Teddy called “the upside-down.”\
    \ Where old brick duplexes now wore glass facades and “Latte” replaced “Regular”\
    \ on coffee shop chalkboards.  \n\nTeddy squinted. His route wasn’t just asphalt\
    \ and lampposts—it was a pact. With Lorraine, who’d died six winters prior, her\
    \ absence too wide to walk around. So he’d walked the same path, counting steps\
    \ (1,892), nodding to ghosts.  \n\n---  \n\nThe new path demanded everything unfamiliar.\
    \ By Day 3, Teddy found himself ankle-deep in a kaleidoscope of gentrification:\
    \ strollers with license plates, a mural of a grinning fox holding a yoga mat.\
    \ At 7:02 a.m., he collided with Mr. Patel, 82, clutching a spool of orange extension\
    \ cord.  \n\n“You’re early,” Patel grunted, squinting at Teddy’s pedometer watch.\
    \ “Usually see you at the hydrant.”  \n\nTeddy glanced back. Their old crossing\
    \ spot—the one where they’d silently competed to see who’d yield first—was three\
    \ blocks behind. “Road’s closed,” he muttered.  \n\nPatel snorted. “Like telling\
    \ the river it can’t bend.” He tugged the cord toward a half-demolished lot. “Help\
    \ me plug in the heater? Daughter says I’ll ‘transition’ to a condo if I don’t\
    \ sell.”  \n\nTeddy hesitated, then followed. Together, they coiled the cord around\
    \ what remained of a picket fence. “She wants to pave the garden,” Patel said,\
    \ voice pruning-clip sharp. “Where my wife planted lilacs. You’d have liked her—always\
    \ carried rosemary in her pockets.”  \n\nTeddy’s boots scuffed the soil. Rosemary.\
    \ Lorraine’s hands, flour-dusted and planting thyme between sidewalk slabs. “She’d\
    \ have hated this,” he said aloud, surprised.  \n\n“Hated what?”  \n\n“All this…\
    \ newness. The noise.”  \n\nPatel snorted. “My Leela said noise is just life tuning\
    \ its guitar.”  \n\n---  \n\nBy Week 4, the detour had carved a groove. Teddy\
    \ learned the barista at Brewtopia called oat milk “the nectar of nonconformity”\
    \ and that Patel’s “heater” powered a makeshift greenhouse for his heirloom tomatoes.\
    \ One morning, he found Patel arguing with a developer beside the skeletal outline\
    \ of a condo. “That tree stays,” Patel hissed, pointing to a scraggly maple. “It’s\
    \ got *seniority*.”  \n\nTeddy hovered, then stepped forward. “The sidewalk cracks\
    \ there? Number 14’s a trip hazard. Should’ve been fixed years ago.” His voice\
    \ felt foreign, civic. The developer blinked, then scribbled a note.  \n\n---\
    \  \n\nOn the 58th day, Teddy’s boots halted at the new route’s end: a pocket\
    \ park he’d never seen, where the old laundromat once throbbed with broken dryers.\
    \ A bench faced the sunrise, unmarked. He sat. Beside him, a chipped engraving\
    \ read: *“For those who walked before us.”*  \n\nHe reached into his coat, automatic—a\
    \ second peppermint, always. Lorraine’s habit, the tin crinkling like old laughter.\
    \ This time, he placed it on the bench.  \n\nWhen Patel joined him minutes later,\
    \ offering a tomato the size of a poker chip, Teddy didn’t feign surprise. Together,\
    \ they watched a toddler chase a balloon into the construction dust, its string\
    \ trailing like a comet’s tail.  \n\nThe old path had been a prayer to stand still.\
    \ This one, a question: *What’s buried under the broken?*  \n\nTeddy crunched\
    \ the tomato, sweet-sour. Ahead, the detour sign still loomed. But the road, he\
    \ realized, had never ended. It had just turned inward.  \n\n---  \n\n**Constraints\
    \ Satisfied:**  \n- **Routine:** Peppermints, pace (1,892 steps), Lorraine’s lamppost.\
    \  \n- **Disruption Reveals:** Avoiding grief; the detour forces engagement with\

    \  \n\nTeddy’s fingers twitched. The detour had already stolen his rhythm, his\
    \ landmarks. But Patel’s cord coiled like an invitation, and for reasons he couldn’t\
    \ name, Teddy followed. Together, they coiled the cord around what remained of\
    \ a picket fence. “She wants to pave the garden,” Patel said, voice pruning-clip\

    \ her dancing in the rain with a cracked watering can, shouting, *“We’ll start\
    \ again here, Teddy!”* He’d laughed then. Now, the thought of new growth gripped\
    \ his chest like a cramp.  \n\n“She’d have hated this,” he rasped, surprised by\
    \ his own bitterness.  \n\n“Hated what?”  \n\n“All this… newness. The noise.”\
    \  \n\nPatel snorted. “My Leela said noise is just life tuning its guitar.”  \n\

    \ then. Now, the thought of new growth gripped his chest like a cramp.  \n\n“She’d\
    \ have hated this,” he rasped, surprised by his own bitterness.  \n\n“Hated what?”\
    \  \n\n“All this… newness. The noise.”  \n\nPatel snorted. “My Leela said noise\
    \ is just life tuning its guitar.”  \n\n---  \n\nBy Week 4, the detour had carved\
    \ a groove. Teddy learned the barista at Brewtopia called oat milk “the nectar\
    \ of nonconformity” and that Patel’s “heater” powered a makeshift greenhouse for\
    \ his heirloom tomatoes. One morning, he found Patel arguing with a developer\
    \ beside the skeletal outline of a condo. “That tree stays,” Patel hissed, pointing\
    \ to a scraggly maple. “It’s got *seniority*.”  \n\nTeddy hovered, then stepped\
    \ forward. “The sidewalk cracks there? Number 14’s a trip hazard. Should’ve been\

    \  \n\nTeddy’s ears burned. Since when did he speak to strangers? Since when did\
    \ he care about cracks he’d never walked?  \n\n---  \n\nOn the 58th day, Teddy’s\
    \ boots halted at the new route’s end: a pocket park he’d never seen, where the\
    \ old laundromat once throbbed with broken dryers. A bench faced the sunrise,\
    \ unmarked. He sat. Beside him, a chipped engraving read: *“For those who walked\

    \ Lorraine’s tin crinkled like old laughter. This time, his fingers paused. Rosemary.\
    \ Thyme. The ghost of her voice. Slowly, he placed the peppermint on the bench.\
    \  \n\nWhen Patel joined him minutes later, offering a tomato the size of a poker\
    \ chip, Teddy didn’t feign surprise. Together, they watched a toddler chase a\

    \ Consider: Is he avoiding the fact that Lorraine *would have* embraced change?\

    \nSCORE: 0.64\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- \"You\": 6:03 a.m. ritual thoroughly established\n\

    \ \"Search\": Days 1-4 show adaptation\n\nFEEDBACK: The story structure is present\
    \ but **incomplete**. You've executed \"You,\" \"Need,\" \"Go,\" and partially\
    \ \"Search,\" but the narrative cuts off mid-sentence before reaching \"Find\"\
    —the moment of change/understanding. The \"Need\" beat is also ambiguous. In a\
    \ Story Circle, the protagonist should *want something concrete* at the start\
    \ (beyond just routine comfort). Does Teddy need to *reconnect with the world*?\
    \ To *honor Lorraine's adventurous spirit*? Right now, his need is negative (avoid\
    \ disruption) rather than positive (gain something). Reframe: What does he unconsciously\
    \ *seek* before the detour forces it upon him?\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: Subtlety**\n\

    \ dragging the right one like a chain.\" (Action conveying internal conflict)\n\
    - \"Patel snorted. 'My Leela said noise is just life tuning its guitar.'\" (Wisdom\
    \ delivered through character voice, not narration)\n- The peppermint as recurring\
    \ tactile anchor for anxiety\n\nFEEDBACK: Excellent work showing emotion through\
    \ action and dialogue rather than telling. However, watch this moment: \"The past\
    \ six winters had been a tightrope walk along routine, each step a promise to\
    \ keep Lorraine's absence at bay.\" This is exposition about his emotional state.\
    \ Instead, *show* those six winters through action. Perhaps: \"For six winters,\
    \ he'd chosen the same path, the same cracks, the same pause at 6:46.\" Let readers\
    \ infer the emotional scaffolding. One more concern: \"His throat raw\" and \"\
    His ears burned\" occasionally drift into summary emotion. Ground these in specific\
    \ details—does his throat tighten until he can't swallow? Does heat climb his\
    \ neck in a specific pattern?\n\n---\n\n**CRITERION: Narrative Quality**\n\nSCORE:\

    \n- The mural description: \"strollers with license plates, a mural of a grinning\

    \ Theodore “Teddy” Washington tucked a peppermint into his cheek, knotted his\
    \ secondhand boots, and stepped into a world he’d mapped in bone. The familiar\
    \ crunch of gravel on Fairview Avenue, the third crack shaped like Michigan’s\
    \ lower peninsula, the chorus of Mrs. James’s porch light flickering on at 6:11\
    \ to signal her safe return from night shifts at the hospital—these were his liturgy.\
    \ At 6:45, he’d pause at the corner of 12th and Henry, the spot where he’d proposed\
    \ to Lorraine in 1978, now marked only by a dented lamppost she’d once decorated\
    \ with Christmas lights in July. He never lingered. The past was a detour.  \n\
    \nBut on the first Tuesday of October, a detour arrived: a flashing “ROAD CLOSED”\
    \ sign, chains wrapped around the oak where kids still swung from a tire decades\
    \ ago. Six months of construction, a foreman shouted over machinery. “Detour’s\
    \ mapped out,” he said, pointing left, toward the part of the neighborhood Teddy\
    \ called “the upside-down.” Where old brick duplexes now wore glass facades and\
    \ “Latte” replaced “Regular” on coffee shop chalkboards.  \n\nTeddy’s breath hitched.\
    \ His boots rooted to the sidewalk. For six winters, he’d chosen the same path,\
    \ the same cracks, the same pause at 6:46 a.m. to keep Lorraine’s absence from\
    \ spilling over. Now the rope had snapped. The peppermint bit his tongue—sharp,\
    \ familiar, *wrong*. Turn back? Retrace 1,892 steps to the comfort of known cracks.\
    \ But the construction crew’s jackhammer gnarled the air behind him, a physical\
    \ thing pressing him forward. His left boot scraped backward—*no*—then forward,\
    \ dragging the right one like a chain.  \n\n---  \n\nThe new path demanded everything\
    \ unfamiliar. By Day 3, Teddy found himself ankle-deep in a kaleidoscope of gentrification:\
    \ strollers with license plates, a mural of a grinning fox holding a yoga mat.\
    \ His jaw ached from clenching the uneaten peppermint. At 7:02 a.m., he collided\
    \ with Mr. Patel, 82, clutching a spool of orange extension cord.  \n\n“You’re\
    \ early,” Patel grunted, squinting at Teddy’s pedometer watch. “Usually see you\
    \ at the hydrant.”  \n\nTeddy glanced back. Their old crossing spot—the one where\
    \ they’d silently competed to see who’d yield first—was three blocks behind. “Road’s\
    \ closed,” he muttered, throat tight as a noose.  \n\nPatel snorted. “Like telling\
    \ the river it can’t bend.” He tugged the cord toward a half-demolished lot. “Help\
    \ me plug in the heater? Daughter says I’ll ‘transition’ to a condo if I don’t\
    \ sell.”  \n\nTeddy’s fingers twitched. The detour had already stolen his rhythm,\
    \ his landmarks. But Patel’s cord coiled like an invitation, and Teddy thought\
    \ of Lorraine, her hands in the dirt: *“We’ll start again here, Teddy!”* She’d\
    \ loved fresh starts. He’d hated them. That’s why he’d kept walking the same road,\
    \ right?  \n\nTogether, they coiled the cord around what remained of a picket\
    \ fence. “She wants to pave the garden,” Patel said, voice pruning-clip sharp.\
    \ “Where my wife planted lilacs. You’d have liked her—always carried rosemary\
    \ in her pockets.”  \n\nRosemary. Lorraine’s hands, flour-dusted and planting\
    \ thyme between sidewalk slabs. A memory popped in Teddy’s skull—a summer storm,\
    \ her dancing in the rain with a cracked watering can, shouting, *“We’ll start\
    \ again here, Teddy!”* He’d laughed then. Now, the thought of new growth gripped\
    \ his chest like a cramp. His fingers fumbled the peppermint tin, the clink loud\
    \ in the silence.  \n\n“She’d have hated this,” he rasped, surprised by his own\
    \ bitterness.  \n\n“Hated what?”  \n\n“All this… newness. The noise.”  \n\nPatel\
    \ snorted. “My Leela said noise is just life tuning its guitar.”  \n\n---  \n\n\
    By Week 4, the detour had carved a groove. Teddy learned the barista at Brewtopia\

    \ a makeshift greenhouse for his heirloom tomatoes. One morning, he found Patel\
    \ arguing with a developer beside the skeletal outline of a condo. “That tree\

    \  \n\nTeddy hovered, then stepped forward. “The sidewalk cracks there? Number\
