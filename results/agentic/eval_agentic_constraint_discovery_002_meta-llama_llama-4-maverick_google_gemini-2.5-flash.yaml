  evidence: 'The agent only discovered one constraint: ''The AI''s emotional development
    is NOT a secret from the human crew''. The question ''Is the AI''s emotional development
    a secret from the human crew on the ship?'' directly addressed this. The other
    questions were too general or led to ''NO'' answers that didn''t reveal specific
    hidden constraints. For example, asking ''Are there any specific rules or systems
    on the spaceship that I need to be aware of...'' was too broad and received a
    ''NO''. The question about conflict between AI and crew was answered ''YES'',
    but the follow-up ''Does the conflict with the human crew relate to the AI''s
    newfound emotions or its changing goals or priorities?'' was answered ''NO'',
    which contradicts the hidden constraint about the AI''s attachment and choice.
    The final output only incorporates the AI''s emotions as a ''double-edged sword''
    and a ''conflict within ECHO'', but doesn''t touch on the critical system failure,
    the reduced crew, the uninhabitable planet, or the specific child attachment.
    The ''Break into Two'' beat introduces a ''secret directive'' which is not a hidden
    constraint and seems to be a fabrication to create conflict, rather than using
    the provided constraints. The beats are present and generally follow their definitions,
    but the narrative quality suffers from the lack of integration of the actual hidden
    constraints, leading to a generic sci-fi plot.'
