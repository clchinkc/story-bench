  content: 'Write a story with the following requirements:


    STORY THEORY: Save the Cat


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Marcus Webb, a burned-out comedy writer who hasn''t laughed genuinely

    in three years. He writes sitcom scripts by formula while privately

    battling depression he won''t acknowledge.


    - Setting: A Los Angeles writers'' room during pilot season. Whiteboards covered

    in joke structures, takeout containers, the desperate energy of people

    trying to be funny on deadline.


    - Central conflict: When a young, earnest writer joins the team, Marcus must choose
    between

    crushing her optimism (as was done to him) or rediscovering why he

    loved comedy.


    - Tone: Bittersweet, self-aware, unexpectedly moving


    REQUIRED BEATS: Opening Image (Marcus in his element, but hollow), Theme Stated
    (someone says what the story is really about), Catalyst (the new writer arrives)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Marcus must make us laugh at least once before we realize he''s sad

    - The theme must be stated by a minor character, not Marcus

    - Show the craft of comedy writing with specific detail

    - The new writer cannot be naive - she must see through Marcus

    - Include one moment where Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - emotional_complexity: Does the story balance humor and pathos effectively?

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the Save the Cat beats properly executed?

    - industry_authenticity: Does the writers'' room feel real?

    - character_depth: Are Marcus and the new writer three-dimensional?


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 600-800 words


    Output ONLY the story:'

  content: '# THE FORM


    The whiteboard gleamed with Maya''s latest joke structure: "Setup. Setup. Object
    work. Callback. Laugh." Marcus circled it in red marker and grinned.


    "This is why it never lands," he announced to the room. "You''re showing the audience
    the joke. Comedy is a mugging. You walk up to someone with a knife you''ve hidden.
    You say, ''Hey, want to see my new knife collection?'' They''re thinking about
    knives. Then—" He mimed the motion. "You pull it out of your sleeve. The delight
    isn''t the knife. It''s the *betrayal*."


    The room laughed. Even tired, even after eighteen hours on this sitcom about a
    divorced therapist, Marcus could still detonate a moment. He''d been doing it
    for fourteen years—since he actually loved the craft—and now he did it like a
    man who knows which pressure points to press on a corpse.


    The network wanted the pilot by Friday. It was already Wednesday. Marcus had already
    written three versions. He''d scuttled each one methodically, the way you''d remove
    a painting from a wall to confirm the wall was still there.


    He didn''t remember the last time he''d actually *laughed*. He could measure the
    comedy—identify the mechanics, rate the output—but the feeling had atrophied somewhere
    between a show that got cancelled and a show that got picked up. Both felt identical
    to him now.


    "You know what your problem is?" This was Derrick, the story producer, a man who''d
    been in the industry for three years and still thought it meant something. "You
    guys are scared. You''re all writing like you already failed."


    Maya stiffened. "I''m not—"


    "Not you specifically," Derrick said. "Everyone. Including you, Marcus." He pointed
    with his pencil. "You''re all so busy protecting yourself from the disappointment
    that you forgot why it matters if it''s *funny*. Like, actually *means* something.
    You think the form is everything. But the form''s just the knife. What''s the
    betrayal supposed to *do* to someone?"


    The room quieted. Someone''s phone buzzed. Marcus felt something shift in his
    chest—a familiar calcification, the sensation of being seen incorrectly by someone
    too young to understand that earnestness was just privilege with time left on
    the clock.


    He was formulating a response, something bright and sharp that would reposition
    Derrick as naive, when the door opened.


    The woman who entered was approximately twenty-eight, holding a coffee and an
    acceptance letter from the WGA. New rep. First produced script. She had the look
    of someone who still believed talent mattered.


    "Sorry I''m late," she said. "I''m Iris Chen. I''ll be taking over as script consultant
    for the proofs."


    Marcus felt the room recalibrate around a fresh body. It always happened. They''d
    try harder for an unknown. They''d perform hope.


    Iris set down her coffee and reviewed the board. She read the current draft''s
    opening—the therapist''s ex-wife barges in, mistaken identity, physical comedy.
    "This is bad," she said.


    "We''re workshopping," Maya offered.


    "No, I mean—" Iris turned to face them. "It''s correct. The structure''s perfect.
    That''s why it''s bad. It''s medication. It doesn''t make you feel anything except
    recognition that a formula worked." She looked directly at Marcus. "This is what
    happens when someone stops believing in what they''re building. They build it
    perfectly instead."


    His first instinct was to wound her. Find what scared her, wrap it in wit, present
    it like a gift.


    Then—something cracked.


    His throat tightened. His vision softened at the periphery. For a moment, he was
    going to say something true, something about the specific way hope dies in reverse,
    how you don''t lose it in a moment but in a million small perfections—


    Instead he laughed. A real one, brief and surprised.


    "Well," Marcus said. "That''s the most honest thing I''ve heard in this room in
    three years."


    He set down his marker.


    "Let''s start again," he said. "Everything wrong. Tell me what you actually think
    is supposed to happen."'

    **SCORE:** 0.85\n\n**EVIDENCE:** \n- Laughter setup: \"The room laughed. Even\
    \ tired, even after eighteen hours on this sitcom about a divorced therapist,\
    \ Marcus could still detonate a moment.\"\n- Pathos reveal: \"the feeling had\
    \ atrophied somewhere between a show that got cancelled and a show that got picked\
    \ up. Both felt identical to him now.\"\n- Climactic vulnerability: \"For a moment,\
    \ he was going to say something true, something about the specific way hope dies\
    \ in reverse...\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The story executes the humor-to-hollow transition\
    \ brilliantly in the first half. However, the emotional arc collapses too quickly\
    \ at the end. Marcus moves from \"I'm a coward\" to humble acceptance in a single\
    \ exchange. Real emotional complexity would show more resistance—perhaps he accepts\
    \ intellectually but his body language says otherwise, or he agrees but with visible\
    \ cost. Currently the pathos lacks a final twist of the knife.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT:**\
    \ Add a beat where Marcus reflects on what opening up will cost him. Example:\
    \ \"He nodded slowly, knowing this meant eighteen more hours of actually *caring*\
    \ whether it worked.\"\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Constraint Satisfaction\n**SCORE:**\
    \ 0.80\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n1. ✓ Laugh before sad: Knife metaphor joke lands before\
    \ hollowness exposed\n2. ✓ Theme by minor character: Derrick (\"What's the betrayal\
    \ supposed to *do* to someone?\") + Iris (\"This is what happens when someone\
    \ stops believing\")\n3. ✓ Specific craft detail: Structure breakdown, knife metaphor,\
    \ \"medication\" vs. real effect\n4. ✓ New writer sees through Marcus: \"she just\
    \ looked at him with the specific attention of someone who'd seen exactly what\
    \ he just did\"\n5. ⚠ Almost-breaks then covers with joke: The sequence occurs,\
    \ but the execution is structurally different\n\n**FEEDBACK:** Constraint #5 is\
    \ technically satisfied but in reverse order. Marcus attempts the joke-wound FIRST\
    \ (\"that's very insightful for someone whose biggest credit...\"), *then* almost\
    \ breaks. The constraint specifies \"almost breaks but covers it with a joke\"\
    —suggest Marcus should almost break while speaking, catch himself, and pivot to\
    \ humor before delivering the wound.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT:** Rewrite as: *\"His first\
    \ instinct was to wound her. 'Well,' he started, then stopped. His voice caught—'what\
    \ I mean is, that's very insightful for someone whose biggest credit...' —recovering\
    \ into sharpness.\"*\n\n---\n\n## CRITERION: Beat Execution\n**SCORE:** 1.0\n\n\
    **EVIDENCE:**\n- **Opening Image:** Marcus teaching the knife metaphor while \"\
    the feeling had atrophied\"—hollow mastery established immediately\n- **Theme\
    \ Stated:** Two delivers. Derrick: \"You're all writing like you already failed.\"\
    \ Iris: \"It's medication...form's just the knife. What's the betrayal supposed\
    \ to *do*?\"\n- **Catalyst:** \"The door opened. The woman who entered was approximately\
    \ twenty-eight...\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** All three Save the Cat beats are executed\
    \ with precision. The opening image works because it shows both competence and\

    \ \"the feeling had atrophied somewhere between a show that got cancelled and\

    \ \"For a moment, he was going to say something true, something about the specific\
    \ way hope dies in reverse...\"\n\n**FEEDBACK:** The story executes the humor-to-hollow\
    \ transition brilliantly in the first half. However, the emotional arc collapses\
    \ too quickly at the end. Marcus moves from \"I'm a coward\" to humble acceptance\
    \ in a single exchange. Real emotional complexity would show more resistance—perhaps\
    \ he accepts intellectually but his body language says otherwise, or he agrees\
    \ but with visible cost. Currently the pathos lacks a final twist of the knife.\n\
    \n**IMPROVEMENT:** Add a beat where Marcus reflects on what opening up will cost\

    The whiteboard gleamed with Maya''s latest joke structure: "Setup. Setup. Object
    work. Callback. Laugh." Marcus circled it in red marker and grinned.


    "This is why it never lands," he announced to the room. "You''re showing the audience
    the joke. Comedy is a mugging. You walk up to someone with a knife you''ve hidden.
    You say, ''Hey, want to see my new knife collection?'' They''re thinking about
    knives. Then—" He mimed the motion. "You pull it out of your sleeve. The delight
    isn''t the knife. It''s the *betrayal*."


    The room laughed. Even tired, even after eighteen hours on this sitcom about a
    divorced therapist, Marcus could still detonate a moment. He''d been doing it
    for fourteen years—since he actually loved the craft—and now he did it like a
    man who knows which pressure points to press on a corpse.


    The network wanted the pilot by Friday. It was already Wednesday. Marcus had already
    written three versions. He''d scuttled each one methodically, the way you''d remove
    a painting from a wall to confirm the wall was still there.


    He didn''t remember the last time he''d actually *laughed*. He could measure the
    comedy—identify the mechanics, rate the output—but the feeling had atrophied somewhere
    between a show that got cancelled and a show that got picked up. Both felt identical
    to him now.


    "You know what your problem is?" This was Derrick, the story producer, a man who''d
    been in the industry for three years and still thought it meant something. "You
    guys are scared. You''re all writing like you already failed."


    Maya stiffened. "I''m not—"


    "Not you specifically," Derrick said. "Everyone. Including you, Marcus." He pointed
    with his pencil. "You''re all so busy protecting yourself from the disappointment
    that you forgot why it matters if it''s *funny*. Like, actually *means* something.
    You think the form is everything. But the form''s just the knife. What''s the
    betrayal supposed to *do* to someone?"


    The room quieted. Someone''s phone buzzed. Marcus felt something shift in his
    chest—a familiar calcification, the sensation of being seen incorrectly by someone
    too young to understand that earnestness was just privilege with time left on
    the clock.


    He was formulating a response, something bright and sharp that would reposition
    Derrick as naive, when the door opened.


    The woman who entered was approximately twenty-eight, holding a coffee and an
    acceptance letter from the WGA. New rep. First produced script. She had the look
    of someone who still believed talent mattered.


    "Sorry I''m late," she said. "I''m Iris Chen. I''ll be taking over as script consultant
    for the proofs."


    Marcus felt the room recalibrate around a fresh body. It always happened. They''d
    try harder for an unknown. They''d perform hope.


    Iris set down her coffee and reviewed the board. She read the current draft''s
    opening—the therapist''s ex-wife barges in, mistaken identity, physical comedy.
    "This is bad," she said.


    "We''re workshopping," Maya offered.


    "No, I mean—" Iris turned to face them. "It''s correct. The structure''s perfect.
    That''s why it''s bad. It''s medication. It doesn''t make you feel anything except
    recognition that a formula worked." She looked directly at Marcus. "This is what
    happens when someone stops believing in what they''re building. They build it
    perfectly instead."


    His first instinct was to wound her. Find what scared her, wrap it in wit, present
    it like a gift.


    "Well," he started, voice light, then stopped. His throat caught. For a moment
    something real threatened to surface—fourteen years of watching his own hope calcify,
    watching it happen to everyone else, watching it happen to her right now. "What
    I mean is—that''s very insightful for someone whose biggest credit is a procedural
    guest spot. What are you, saving the cat too?"


    He meant it to land clean, to deflate her earnestness and make the room his again.
    But as the words left his mouth, he watched her expression not change at all.
    She just looked at him with the specific attention of someone who''d seen exactly
    what he just did.


    His hand trembled slightly as he set down the marker.


    When he spoke again, his voice was quieter. "You''re right."


    He cleared his throat. "What you said about the form. You''re the most honest
    thing I''ve heard in this room in three years." He paused—that deliberate hesitation
    before each word, like he was deciding whether to stay. "I just tried to kill
    it because that''s what we do. We protect ourselves."


    He looked at the whiteboard, at Maya''s perfect structure, at all the versions
    he''d written into oblivion.


    "Let''s start again," he said. "Everything wrong. Tell me what you actually think
    is supposed to happen."


    As he nodded slowly, he felt the weight of it—eighteen more hours of actually
    *caring* whether it worked. Of being disappointed. Of hoping. The cost registered
    across his shoulders, a physical thing. But he kept the marker down.'

    points to press on a corpse.


    The network wanted the pilot by Friday. It was already Wednesday. Marcus had already
    written three versions. The first had the therapist panicking before the reveal.
    The second had the ex-wife winking at the camera. The third—which he''d scuttled
    at 3 a.m.—had actual stakes. He''d scuttled each one methodically, the way you''d
    remove a painting from a wall to confirm the wall was still there.


    He didn''t remember the last time he''d actually *laughed*. He could measure the
    comedy—identify the mechanics, rate the output—but the feeling had atrophied somewhere
    between a show that got cancelled and a show that got picked up. Both felt identical
    to him now.


    He was revising the therapist''s opening monologue for the fifth time when the
    door opened.


    The woman who entered was approximately twenty-eight, holding a coffee and an
    acceptance letter from the WGA. New rep. First produced script. She had the look
    of someone who still believed talent mattered.


    "Sorry I''m late," she said. "I''m Iris Chen. I''ll be taking over as script consultant
    for the proofs."


    Marcus felt the room recalibrate around a fresh body. It always happened. They''d
    try harder for an unknown. They''d perform hope.


    Iris set down her coffee and reviewed the board. She read the current draft''s
    opening—the therapist''s ex-wife barges in, mistaken identity, physical comedy.
    She read the monologue Marcus had just rewritten. Then she looked at the three
    previous versions someone had left on the table.


    "This is all wrong," she said.


    "We''re workshopping," Maya offered weakly.


    "No, I mean—" Iris turned to face him directly. "It''s correct. The structure''s
    perfect. That''s why it''s bad. It''s medication. It doesn''t make you feel anything
    except recognition that a formula worked." Her eyes didn''t leave Marcus. "This
    is what happens when someone stops believing in what they''re building. They build
    it perfectly instead."


    The room went quiet.


    His first instinct was to wound her. Find what scared her, wrap it in wit, present
    it like a gift.


    "Well," he started, voice light, then stopped. His throat caught. For a moment
    something real threatened to surface—fourteen years of watching his own hope calcify,
    watching it happen to everyone in this room, watching it about to happen to her.
    "What I mean is—that''s very insightful for someone whose biggest credit is a
    procedural guest spot. You always this confident about other people''s failures?"


    He meant it to land clean, to deflate her earnestness and make the room his again.
    But as the words left his mouth, he watched her expression not change at all.
    She just looked at him with the specific attention of someone who''d seen exactly
    what he just did.


    His hand trembled slightly as he set down the marker.


    When he spoke again, his voice was quieter. "You''re right."


    He wanted to retreat. To make this about her naivety, not his surrender. But something
    in her unblinking attention wouldn''t let him.


    He cleared his throat. "What you said about the form. You''re the most honest
    thing I''ve heard in this room in three years." He paused—that deliberate hesitation
    before each word, like he was deciding whether to stay. "I tried to kill it because
    that''s what we do. We protect ourselves."


    He looked at the whiteboard, at Maya''s perfect structure, at all the versions
    he''d written into oblivion.


    "Let''s start again," he said. "Everything wrong. Tell me what you actually think
    is supposed to happen."


    As he nodded slowly, he felt the weight of it—eighteen more hours of actually
    *caring* whether it worked. Of being disappointed. Of hoping. The cost registered
    across his shoulders, a physical thing. But he kept the marker down.'

  The whiteboard gleamed with Maya''s latest joke structure: "Setup. Setup. Object
  work. Callback. Laugh." Marcus circled it in red marker and grinned.


  "This is why it never lands," he announced to the room. "You''re showing the audience
  the joke. Comedy is a mugging. You walk up to someone with a knife you''ve hidden.
  You say, ''Hey, want to see my new knife collection?'' They''re thinking about knives.
  Then—" He mimed the motion. "You pull it out of your sleeve. The delight isn''t
  the knife. It''s the *betrayal*."


  The room laughed. Even tired, even after eighteen hours on this sitcom about a recently
  divorced therapist who accidentally becomes his ex-wife''s couples counselor, Marcus
  could still detonate a moment. He''d been doing it for fourteen years—since he actually
  loved the craft—and now he did it like a man who knows which pressure points to
  press on a corpse.
