  evidence: 'Across V0→V3 the draft became noticeably more child-authentic and sensory-driven.
    V0 used more adult-narrator phrasing; V1–V2 replaced several of those lines with
    expressive, age-appropriate quips (e.g., “Totally busted,” grease-stained hands,
    mango bar banter). The revisions explicitly added sensory threshold detail (pressure,
    light, muffled sound) and made the crossing genuinely dangerous (lethal currents,
    storm surge, raft slammed against hatch). Constraints were each implemented: Zara
    is competent but fallible (turbine shudders under strain), an adult (Councilwoman
    Reyes/anonymous mutter) dismisses her as “just a kid,” the mentor Eli has a specific
    flaw (failed seawall design/guilt and alcoholism), Zara’s micro-turbine demonstrates
    ingenuity, and the crossing presents real physical peril. Strengths (snappy dialogue,
    inventive gadget, vivid world hints) were retained while addressing youth-voice
    critiques; only minor traces of slightly mature phrasing remain but are largely
    integrated into character dialogue rather than omniscient narration.'
