  evidence: 'PLAN QUALITY: Comprehensive outline with clear beat structure, thematic
    grounding, and specific character arcs. Plan explicitly identifies all constraints
    and integrates them strategically. Strong specificity in VR technique, past failure
    setup, and Sterling reveal. ADHERENCE: Output follows plan closely with minor
    deviations. Opening, catalyst, and midpoint align well. Some compression of middle
    acts reduces tension buildup. CONSTRAINTS ANALYSIS: (1) FALSE LEAD - Dr. Whitmore
    pursuit satisfies this well; (2) UNCONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUE - VR crime scene recreation
    is creative and well-executed; (3) TICKING CLOCK - 6-day deadline and accelerating
    murders present but could be more prominent in final act; (4) SECONDARY BETRAYAL
    - Amy''s report works but feels rushed and underdeveloped; (5) MIDPOINT CONFRONTATION
    - Phone call with Sterling is non-physical and direct, satisfies requirement;
    (6) PAST FAILURE CONFRONTATION - Explicitly addressed at grave scene and through
    Sterling''s accusations. BEAT EXECUTION: All 4 required beats present: Catalyst
    (new murder/Amy''s call), Debate (internal conflict about involvement), Break
    into Two (Whitmore chase/Sterling reveal), Midpoint (phone confrontation forcing
    self-reckoning). NARRATIVE ISSUES: Pacing compresses significantly in final third.
    Amy''s betrayal lacks emotional weight—needs more setup. Sterling''s motivation
    (parallel cases/ego) could be clearer. Ending feels somewhat rushed despite thematic
    resonance. VR sequences are underutilized in execution vs. plan. Rain/pattern
    motif is effective but repetitive. Overall solid thriller with strong character
    arc but execution loses some tension in compression.'
