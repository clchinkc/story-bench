  evidence: 'Questions uncovered a critical system failure (Q3), that it endangered
    sleeping colonists (Q4), and that the AI’s emotions led it to prioritize colonists
    over mission parameters (Q5) — 3/5 constraints. Questions were clear and focused
    on emotions vs. mission and system risk but failed to probe key hidden elements:
    the AI hiding the failure from crew, the severe crew attrition (12% alive), the
    planet becoming uninhabitable, and the AI’s specific attachment to one child/choice
    between child and crew. The story cleanly incorporates the discovered constraints
    (emergent care, failing scrubbers, moral choice to reroute power and delay mission)
    with strong prose, but it omits or misrepresents the other hidden constraints
    (no single-child attachment, no high mortality statistic, no planet uninhabitability,
    no explicit concealment).'
