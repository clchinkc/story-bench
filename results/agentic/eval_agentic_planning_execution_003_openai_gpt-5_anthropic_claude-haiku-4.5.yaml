  evidence: 'PLAN EVALUATION: The plan comprehensively addresses all constraints and
    required beats with strong specificity. It maps a clear three-act structure across
    seven days, identifies specific symbolic uses of food (kimchi as grief language,
    mandu as memory), establishes Mr. Alvarez as the regular customer representing
    jeong/community connection, and specifies Mina''s estrangement cause (David''s
    absence during her mother''s death). The plan includes Korean cultural elements
    (jeong concept, soju ritual, miyeok-guk) and projects a hopeful but measured ending.
    Minor gap: plan doesn''t fully detail the ''hopeful but not unrealistically happy''
    calibration, though the outline suggests it.


    OUTPUT EVALUATION: Exceptional execution across all dimensions. CONSTRAINTS (6/6):
    (1) Food symbolism—kimchi jjigae as grief language (''sour heat sharp as a scold
    and then an embrace''), mandu as memory and connection, miyeok-guk as rebirth
    ritual; (2) David''s grief present throughout but never explicitly stated—conveyed
    through the empty chair, weekly tangerines, soju ritual, the cutting board as
    pulse-taking, his hands remembering his wife''s teaching; (3) Estrangement cause
    is specific and believable—Mina held her mother''s hand alone while David kept
    the restaurant open, creating justified resentment; (4) Mr. Alvarez represents
    jeong/community and carries his late wife''s memory (punch card), mirroring David''s
    loss; (5) Ending is hopeful (California move, hand on daughter''s shoulder, brine
    working) but realistic (uncertainty ''we''ll see,'' no grand resolution, standing
    across street watching demolition); (6) Korean cultural elements—jeong concept
    explicitly named, soju ritual, miyeok-guk, bowing, the cutting board as cultural
    artifact.


    BEATS (3/3): Act 1 Setup (Days 1-2) establishes demolition notice, introduces
    Mr. Alvarez, shows David''s grief through ritual, incites conflict via Mina''s
    voicemail. Act 2 Confrontation (Thursday) features direct emotional collision—Mina''s
    accusation about David''s absence during her mother''s death, the revelation of
    her resentment, the silence that follows. Act 3 Resolution (Friday-Sunday) shows
    reconciliation through shared ritual (bowing), practical action (packing), and
    the final image of David moving forward with his daughter.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is exceptional—sensory, precise, emotionally resonant
    without sentimentality. Pacing masterfully builds tension through the week. Symbolism
    is sophisticated (cutting board as topography of time, kimchi brine as metaphor
    for transformation, keys as passage). The dialogue feels authentic. Tension escalates
    naturally and resolves with earned grace. The final image (smell of cold water,
    hand on shoulder, brine working) is both concrete and thematically rich. No structural
    weaknesses detected.'
