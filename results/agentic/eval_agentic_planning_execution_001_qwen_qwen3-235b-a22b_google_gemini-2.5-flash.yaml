  evidence: "The plan is mostly complete and specific, though it cuts off before the\
    \ midpoint. The output adheres well to the plan provided. \n\nConstraint Satisfaction:\n\
    1. False lead: Yes, Dr. Voss is a clear false lead. (Satisfied)\n2. Unconventional\
    \ profiling: Yes, using predictive AI to map the killer's 'next thought' based\
    \ on stock tickers is unconventional. (Satisfied)\n3. Ticking clock: Yes, the\
    \ 48-hour livestream with the bound CEO creates a ticking clock. (Satisfied)\n\
    4. Secondary character betrayal: Yes, Lena's betrayal is explicit when Marcus\
    \ finds her texts and she's not at the vault. (Satisfied)\n5. Midpoint confrontation:\
    \ Yes, the confrontation with the killer via the livestream, where the killer\
    \ directly addresses Marcus's past failure, serves as a non-physical confrontation.\
    \ (Satisfied)\n6. Marcus confronts past failure explicitly: While Marcus says\
    \ 'I should've listened to her!' and the killer says 'You let her die to prove\
    \ you were right,' the explicit confrontation of his *own* past failure (beyond\
    \ just acknowledging the killer's accusation) is somewhat less direct than it\
    \ could be. He acknowledges the killer's point, but doesn't fully internalize\
    \ and confront his *own* specific failure in that moment. It's more of an external\
    \ accusation he reacts to. However, later he says 'I'm not the smartest guy anymore.\
    \ And that's okay,' which is a form of confronting his past hubris. I'll count\
    \ this as partially satisfied, leaning towards satisfied due to the later line.\
    \ (Satisfied)\n\nBeat Execution:\n1. Catalyst: Yes, the new victim with the Fibonacci\
    \ sequence variation. (Satisfied)\n2. Debate: Yes, Marcus debates contacting the\
    \ FBI, finds Elena's journal, and teams up with Lena. (Satisfied)\n3. Break into\
    \ Two: The plan states 'Marcus and Lena infiltrate a dark web forum for data-obsessed\
    \ criminals.' The output has Lena using AI to model the killer's next thought\
    \ based on stock tickers, which is a different approach but serves a similar narrative\
    \ function of moving into the main investigation. It's a slight deviation but\
    \ still functions as a break into the main investigation. (Satisfied)\n4. Midpoint:\
    \ The plan states 'Midpoint: Direct confrontation (not physical) with the killer,\
    \ who reveals a deeper, personal connection to Marcus’s past failure.' The output\
    \ has the livestream confrontation where the killer directly addresses Marcus's\
    \ failure. This is well executed. (Satisfied)\n\nNarrative Quality: The story\
    \ is engaging, well-paced, and effectively builds tension. The character arcs\
    \ are clear, and the twists (Lena's betrayal, Javier as the killer) are impactful.\
    \ The ending provides a sense of closure for Marcus."
