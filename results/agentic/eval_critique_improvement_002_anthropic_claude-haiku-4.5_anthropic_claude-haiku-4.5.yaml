  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.75): The revisions show selective engagement
    with feedback. Critiques consistently praised emotional_complexity (0.82-0.85
    range), and the final output preserves this strength with the knife metaphor and
    Marcus''s throat-catching moment. However, the revisions don''t demonstrate clear
    iteration on constraint satisfaction or industry authenticity—the versions appear
    nearly identical in the provided text, suggesting limited visible refinement cycle.
    The final output does address the core feedback about balancing humor and pathos,
    but the revision trajectory itself is opaque.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.72): Quality appears stable rather than demonstrably
    improving. The three critiques all scored emotional_complexity in the 0.82-0.85
    band, suggesting the story hit its target early and revisions maintained rather
    than elevated performance. The final output is strong but doesn''t show clear
    gains over the critique baseline. The knife joke and Marcus''s near-break are
    present in all versions mentioned, indicating the core beats weren''t substantially
    reworked.


    PRESERVATION (0.88): Excellent. The final output retains all praised elements:
    the knife metaphor (''walk up to someone with a knife you''ve hidden''), the corpse
    pressure-point imagery, the laugh-then-pathos structure, and the specific detail
    of eighteen hours on a show about a divorced therapist. The new writer (Iris)
    is introduced with appropriate skepticism and sees through Marcus''s deflection
    attempt. These strengths survived intact.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.80 / 4 of 5):

    1. ✓ Marcus makes us laugh before sadness is clear: The knife mugging joke lands
    (''The room laughed''), then the atrophy reveal follows. SATISFIED.

    2. ✓ Theme stated by minor character: Iris articulates it explicitly: ''It''s
    medication. It doesn''t make you feel anything except recognition that a formula
    worked.'' Marcus doesn''t state the theme. SATISFIED.

    3. ✓ Craft of comedy writing with specific detail: The knife metaphor, ''Setup.
    Setup. Object work. Callback. Laugh,'' the pressure-point imagery, the distinction
    between structure and feeling. SATISFIED.

    4. ✓ New writer sees through Marcus: Iris watches him wound her, recognizes the
    deflection (''the specific attention of someone who''d seen exactly what he just
    did''), doesn''t flinch. SATISFIED.

    5. ✗ Marcus almost breaks but covers with a joke: The execution is ambiguous.
    Marcus''s throat catches and ''something real threatened to surface,'' but his
    response (''What I mean is—that''s very insightful...'') is a wound, not a joke-cover.
    He doesn''t deploy humor to mask the break; he deploys cruelty. The constraint
    asks for a moment where he *almost* breaks then *covers with a joke*—this is a
    break that he covers with cruelty, then surrenders. PARTIALLY SATISFIED but not
    cleanly executed.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.82): The Save the Cat structure is present: Inciting Incident
    (Iris enters), Debate (her critique), Break into Two (Marcus''s attempted wound),
    B Story (Iris as mirror), Midpoint (his throat catching), Bad Guys Close In (the
    weight of caring), Dark Night (his surrender), Final Image (marker down, ready
    to care again). The beats are there but compressed; the story prioritizes character
    depth over beat clarity. Solid execution with minor pacing compression.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.85): The final output is genuinely strong. The prose is specific
    (''detonate a moment,'' ''pressure points to press on a corpse''), the dialogue
    reveals character efficiently, and the emotional arc—from performative mastery
    to genuine vulnerability—lands. Iris is a credible foil. The stakes (caring vs.
    protecting) are clear. The only weakness is the ambiguous handling of constraint
    5, which slightly undercuts the precision of the character work. The ending is
    earned but could be sharper.'
  summary: The final output successfully delivers a story with strong emotional complexity,
    authentic writers' room dynamics, and compelling character depth. Four of five
    constraints are clearly satisfied; the fifth (Marcus covering a near-break with
    a joke) is executed as a near-break covered with cruelty followed by surrender,
    which is thematically coherent but technically imprecise. The revision process
    appears stable rather than iterative—critiques praised the core elements consistently,
    and the final version preserves those strengths without demonstrating substantial
    improvement across the revision cycle. This suggests either the story was strong
    from early drafts or the revision feedback wasn't fully leveraged. Narrative quality
    is high; constraint precision is good but not perfect.
