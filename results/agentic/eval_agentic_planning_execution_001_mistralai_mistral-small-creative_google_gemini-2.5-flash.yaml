  evidence: The plan is mostly complete and specific, though it misses the 'Debate'
    beat. The final output adheres well to the plan, including the false lead, unconventional
    profiling (though less explicit than planned), ticking clock, betrayal, and confrontation.
    The explicit confrontation with past failure is present. The 'Debate' beat is
    not clearly executed in the final output. The narrative quality is good, with
    a strong atmosphere and decent pacing, but some elements feel a bit rushed or
    underdeveloped.
