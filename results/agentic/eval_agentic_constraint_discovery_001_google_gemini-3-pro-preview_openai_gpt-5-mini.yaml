  evidence: Only 1 of 5 hidden constraints was correctly elicited by questions (that
    the loved one to be sacrificed is the Mentor). Questions were well-formed and
    targeted forging/sacrifice mechanics, but missed major areas (time limit, father's
    failed-hero backstory, prohibition on protagonist using magic, and that the sword
    must be a reforged ancestral blade). The story itself includes the Mentor's death
    and the protagonist not using magic directly, but omits or contradicts other hidden
    constraints (no three-day limit, no failed-hero father, forging uses the mentor's
    soul rather than the protagonist's blood, and the weapon is not explicitly a reforged
    ancestral broken sword). Beats that do appear (Ordeal, sacrifice, forging, final
    wielding) are executed clearly and emotionally, but several required constraints/beats
    are missing.
