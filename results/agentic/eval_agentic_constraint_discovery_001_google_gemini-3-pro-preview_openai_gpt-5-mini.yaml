  evidence: No questions were asked (discovery_efficiency 0). Story satisfies mentor
    death during the Ordeal and avoids the protagonist casting direct magic (2/5 constraints
    => 0.4). It fails to include the three-day time limit, the protagonist's father
    as a failed hero, and the reforging of a broken ancestral sword. Beats around
    the Ordeal and emotional sacrifice are well executed, but key required beats (time
    pressure, ancestral sword/family arc) are missing (beat_execution 0.6). Overall
    writing is coherent and engaging with strong stakes and imagery (narrative_quality
    0.8).
