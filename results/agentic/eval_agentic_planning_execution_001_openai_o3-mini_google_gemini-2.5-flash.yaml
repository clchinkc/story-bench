  evidence: 'The plan addresses all constraints and beats. The plan is mostly specific,
    though some details like the ''unconventional profiling technique'' are left a
    bit vague. The final output adheres well to the plan, though the ''Midpoint''
    is not a direct confrontation as planned. The output satisfies 5/6 constraints:
    false lead, unconventional profiling, ticking clock, secondary character betrayal,
    and confronting past failure. The ''Midpoint'' beat is not a direct confrontation
    as specified in the plan. The narrative quality is adequate, but the pacing feels
    rushed, especially towards the end, and the ''Midpoint'' confrontation feels a
    bit forced and doesn''t quite land as a direct confrontation with the killer or
    a key antagonist.'
