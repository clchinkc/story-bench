  evidence: Each revision shows clear, constructive change. V0 established a strong
    auditory opening but was fragmentary. V1 tightened rhythm and added specific sonic
    details (horns, jackhammer pattern) and the nick on the fader. V2 introduced taste
    (coffee) and refined the AC description and tactile detail, increasing sensory
    variety. V3 polished phrasing and atmosphere. The final adds the concrete audio
    clue (chipped enamel bell; descending tri-tone; G train), the clip playback scene,
    the investigation/scavenger-hunt 'fun and games' with community interactions,
    the foreman who underestimates Imani, and the dark intrusion into her feed that
    flips tone. Good elements (sound-centered voice, tactile cues, cane-as-tool, investigative
    method) were preserved and amplified. The revisions responded well to likely feedback
    points (more sensory detail, specific audio clue, clearer investigation beats)
    and culminated in a cohesive, well-paced scene that satisfies all stated constraints.
