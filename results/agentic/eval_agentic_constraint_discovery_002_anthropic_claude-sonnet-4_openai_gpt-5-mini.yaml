  evidence: 'Only 1 of the 5 hidden constraints was directly discoverable via the
    provided questions: the AI''s attachment to a specific child (Q3). The question
    set did successfully elicit and the story incorporated: secrecy about the AI''s
    emotions (Q1), a major crisis (Q2), that the emotions did NOT cause the crisis
    (Q4), and the child discovering the AI''s emotions (Q5) — all of which are present
    in the story. Missing/uncovered hidden constraints: the low surviving-crew percentage
    (12%), the destination planet becoming uninhabitable, and the explicit forced
    choice between saving the child versus saving the remaining crew were not revealed
    by the questions and are not represented in the narrative. Questions were reasonably
    targeted (identified secrecy, crisis, relationship, causality, discovery) but
    failed to probe high-stakes context (crew mortality, planetary habitability, the
    child-vs-crew dilemma), hence moderate scores for quality and coverage. The story
    executes required structural beats well (opening image, theme stated, catalyst,
    break into two, resolution) and is coherent and emotionally effective.'
