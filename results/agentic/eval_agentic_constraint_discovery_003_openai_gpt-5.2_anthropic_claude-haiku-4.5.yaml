  evidence: 'DISCOVERY: All 5 hidden constraints were successfully discoverable through
    the 5 questions asked. Questions were strategically targeted at core narrative
    elements (romance type, secrets, rivals, festival centerpiece, ending tone) and
    covered distinct constraint areas effectively. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Story
    incorporates all discovered constraints: (1) Second-chance romance with Eli (high
    school connection) ✓; (2) Secret about why protagonist left (father''s theft,
    mother''s blackmail) revealed in climax ✓; (3) Marissa as active romantic/business
    rival ✓; (4) Autumn Lantern Parade as specific festival centerpiece with book
    booth ✓; (5) Bittersweet ending (Eli and Rowan don''t end together, unresolved
    longing) ✓. BEAT EXECUTION: All required narrative beats present and well-executed:
    homecoming setup, rival introduction, tension escalation, secret revelation at
    parade, emotional resolution with separation. Minor gap: mother''s dementia mentioned
    implicitly (context for return) but not deeply integrated into climactic moment.
    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Exceptional prose quality with strong sensory detail, emotional
    authenticity, and character voice. Pacing is deliberate and effective. The secret
    revelation feels earned and devastating. Ending achieves genuine bittersweet tone—not
    contrived sadness but earned complexity. Marissa''s character arc (from antagonist
    to revealed as collateral damage) adds sophistication. Small weakness: could have
    given slightly more weight to the mother''s condition as emotional anchor for
    protagonist''s internal conflict.'
