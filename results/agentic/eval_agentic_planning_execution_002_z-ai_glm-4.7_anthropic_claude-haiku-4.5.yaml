  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Exceptional execution of isolation through behavioral specificity
    (haptic gloves, calendar scheduling, swiping invitations). The alien signal is
    genuinely alien—described as gravity fluctuation, four-dimensional geometry, and
    emotional resonance rather than anthropomorphic communication. Elias Thorne effectively
    challenges Yuki''s theoretical approach with pragmatic demands. Silas Vane is
    genuinely unconventional (blind synesthetic composer as mentor, non-scientist
    perspective). The psychological threshold is masterfully executed—removing gloves
    as vulnerability, sensory deprivation tank as liminal space, empathic breakthrough
    as crossing point. The human connection moment (hand-holding with Elias) is surprising,
    earned, and emotionally resonant. All four beats present: Call (signal arrival),
    Refusal (retreating to theory, dismissing the live feed), Meeting Mentor (Silas''s
    intervention), Crossing Threshold (tank sequence). MINOR GAPS: The ''anthropomorphic''
    constraint is nearly perfect but the signal''s interpretation as ''loneliness''
    and ''grief'' borders on slight anthropomorphization—though this is mitigated
    by framing it as Yuki''s empathic projection rather than the signal''s inherent
    nature. Plan shows excellent detail but could have specified the sensory deprivation
    tank sequence more explicitly. Output adheres closely to plan with natural narrative
    flow. Pacing is excellent, tension builds methodically, and the emotional arc
    is compelling.'
