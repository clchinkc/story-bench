  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer addressed Critique 2''s structural
    flaw (Sophie''s duplicate appearance) by Version 3, showing direct responsiveness.
    However, Critique 1''s emotional complexity concern (0.68) wasn''t substantially
    deepened—the watering eyes moment exists but remains surface-level. The writer
    acknowledged the constraint satisfaction issue but didn''t fully resolve it. Score:
    0.72 reflects partial but incomplete responsiveness.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: V0→V1 shows minor technical refinement (adding ''three
    beats, max''). V1→V2 introduces sensory detail (fluorescent lights, eye ache)
    and Sophie''s entrance, marking meaningful progress. V2→V3 appears identical in
    provided text, suggesting plateau. The trajectory shows improvement but stalls
    before reaching excellence. Score: 0.68.


    PRESERVATION: Strong preservation of Marcus''s voice and the writers'' room authenticity
    across versions. The coffee shop ending was added thoughtfully without disrupting
    earlier beats. Sophie''s characterization as perceptive remained consistent. Minor
    loss: the specific joke structure debate (''allergies'' callback) became less
    technical in later versions. Score: 0.75.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4/5):

    ✓ Constraint 1 (laugh before sadness): ''at least I''m not still living with my
    parents'' lands humor before vulnerability emerges. SATISFIED.

    ✓ Constraint 2 (theme by minor character): Mike states ''vulnerability, not formula''
    and Sophie reinforces it. SATISFIED.

    ✓ Constraint 3 (comedy craft specificity): Sophie''s ''allergy as metaphor for
    emotional state'' and ''specificity makes it universal'' shows craft discussion.
    SATISFIED.

    ✓ Constraint 4 (new writer sees through Marcus): Sophie explicitly calls out his
    fear: ''I think that''s exactly what you''re afraid of, Marcus.'' SATISFIED.

    ✓ Constraint 5 (almost-break moment with joke cover): Marcus''s trembling hand
    and watering eyes during the ''living with parents'' joke demonstrates the beat.
    SATISFIED.


    Actually: All 5 constraints ARE satisfied. Revising to 5/5. Score: 0.80 reflects
    minor execution roughness despite full constraint coverage.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Inciting Incident (Sophie''s arrival) is clear. Midpoint (Sophie''s
    vulnerability challenge) lands. Climax (the almost-break covered by joke) executes
    well. However, the resolution (coffee shop agreement) feels rushed and underdeveloped—lacks
    the emotional weight of preceding beats. The Save the Cat structure is present
    but unevenly weighted. Score: 0.70.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Dialogue is natural and industry-authentic. Character dynamics
    between Marcus and Sophie crackle with tension. Sensory details (fluorescent glare,
    trembling hand, watering eyes) ground the emotional stakes. Weaknesses: the coffee
    shop coda tells rather than shows Marcus''s internal shift; some exposition feels
    heavy (''I''ve seen it happen on other shows''). The ending promises growth but
    doesn''t dramatize it. Score: 0.73.


    OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The final output successfully balances humor and pathos, satisfies
    all constraints, and demonstrates genuine improvement from V0. The revision process
    showed responsiveness to structural feedback but didn''t fully address emotional
    depth concerns from Critique 1. The story works as a scene but would benefit from
    deeper exploration of Marcus''s internal resistance in the resolution.'
