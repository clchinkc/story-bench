  evidence: 'The final output demonstrates strong narrative craft with clear progression:
    Elena''s competence is established immediately (catching errors, 16 years experience,
    organizational mastery). The friendship with Sarah feels genuinely earned through
    specific, reciprocal moments—Sarah reads Elena''s work, brings coffee, invites
    her to family dinner. The dinner scene is particularly effective, using sensory
    details (mother''s touch, noise, laughter) to show Elena''s emotional awakening.
    The medical detail (SOFA score for ICU triage prediction) integrates naturally
    and serves the characterization. However, the ambiguity constraint is only partially
    satisfied—the ending leans toward ''she hasn''t changed'' rather than maintaining
    true ambiguity. The final image of Elena setting her phone face-down suggests
    regression, but a stronger ambiguous ending would leave readers genuinely uncertain
    whether this is retreat or strategic boundary-setting. The transformation is appropriately
    internal (no external changes to appearance/role), shown through Elena''s awareness
    of silence, her physical reactions (throat tightness), and her moment of genuine
    laughter. Across revisions, the core opening remained stable (good preservation),
    but the final version adds crucial middle sections showing the friendship development
    and the dinner scene that were likely missing or underdeveloped in earlier versions.
    The trajectory shows refinement rather than radical overhaul, suggesting thoughtful
    iteration rather than major structural problems in earlier drafts.'
