  evidence: The quality improved significantly across revisions. Version 0 was a very
    rough start, barely setting the scene. Version 1 introduced more sensory details
    and a clearer sense of Mateo's burden. Version 2 deepened the internal conflict
    by showing the repetitive nature of his chores and the emotional toll. Version
    3 (the final output) successfully integrated the grandmother's role in crystallizing
    the choice, showed Mateo's internal conflict through his actions and thoughts,
    and introduced an adult (Abuela) who genuinely understands his dilemma. The cultural
    elements feel authentic, and the resolution, while not fully shown in this excerpt,
    is set up by Mateo's growth in tearing the flyer. The only constraint not fully
    met is the 'one adult must genuinely understand Mateo's dilemma' as the father's
    understanding is still ambiguous at the end of the excerpt, though Abuela's understanding
    is clear.
