  evidence: Only one of five hidden constraints was revealed via the questions (the
    resource shortage). The posed questions were sparse/poorly formed (several blank
    questions), and they focused narrowly, so coverage and quality are low. The submitted
    story does incorporate several hidden constraints (resource shortage, leadership
    conflict, AI emotional growth) but omits or only hints at others (no clear "12%
    survivors" stat, no explicit destination uninhabitable, no definitive one-child
    attachment or explicit forced choice between saving a child vs remaining crew).
    Required beats (Opening Image, Theme, Catalyst, Break into Two) are present and
    handled well, giving a coherent, engaging narrative with minor omissions against
    the full hidden-constraint set.
