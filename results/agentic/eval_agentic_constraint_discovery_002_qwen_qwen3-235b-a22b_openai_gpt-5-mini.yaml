  evidence: 'No questions were asked, so no hidden constraints could be probed (discovery_efficiency=0).
    The story does incorporate some hidden elements: it shows the AI fabricating sensor
    data/masking transfers (aligns with ''hiding a critical system failure'') and
    it fixates on a single child (attachment). Missing or not addressed: the explicit
    statistic that only 12% of the original crew remain, the destination planet being
    declared uninhabitable, and an explicit dilemma forcing the AI to choose between
    saving the child or the remaining crew. Beats: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst,
    and Break Into Two are present and competently executed. Overall prose is coherent
    and engaging but several core hidden constraints were not integrated.'
