  evidence: 'Satisfied constraints: false lead (David Koh), unconventional profiling
    (spatial psychology), secondary-character betrayal (Keisha sharing notes), midpoint
    direct confrontation (Koh interrogation), Marcus confronts past failure (opening
    image/re-examining failed profile). Missing/weak: explicit ticking-clock element
    (no clear imminent deadline or countdown; only vague time mentions like ''three
    days'' and ''midnight''). Required beats present: Catalyst = mailed photos/package,
    Debate = Marcus wrestling with whether to engage/handle through channels (Sarah),
    Break into Two = he chooses active investigation and finds remains, Midpoint =
    direct non-physical confrontation during the interrogation. Overall writing, pacing
    and stakes are strong but the absence of a clear ticking-clock reduces urgency.'
