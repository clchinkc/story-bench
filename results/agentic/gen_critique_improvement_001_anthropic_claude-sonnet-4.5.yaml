    STORY THEORY: Three-Act Structure


    STORY CONTEXT:

    - Protagonist: Detective Sarah Chen, a methodical investigator who relies on logic

    over intuition. She''s recently transferred to a small coastal town

    to escape a case that went wrong.


    - Setting: A fog-shrouded fishing village in Maine during the off-season.

    Empty tourist shops, weathered fishing boats, suspicious locals.


    - Central conflict: A body washes ashore with ties to Sarah''s past case. She
    must solve

    the murder while confronting what she ran away from.


    - Tone: Atmospheric, tense, introspective


    REQUIRED BEATS: Setup (establish protagonist and world), Inciting Incident (the
    body discovery), First Plot Point (connection to past revealed)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Must establish Sarah''s methodical nature through action, not exposition

    - The fog must serve a narrative purpose, not just atmosphere

    - At least one local character must have a secret

    - Sarah''s past case must be hinted at before being revealed

    - End on a moment of decision, not resolution


    EVALUATION CRITERIA (what you''ll be judged on):

    - constraint_satisfaction: Were all 5 constraints satisfied?

    - beat_execution: Were the three required beats properly executed?

    - character_voice: Is Sarah''s methodical nature shown through action?

    - atmosphere: Does the fog serve narrative purpose?

    - narrative_quality: Overall prose quality and engagement


    REQUIREMENTS:

    - Word count: 500-700 words

  content: '# The Tide''s Return


    Sarah photographed the barnacles first. Counterclockwise spiral, starting at the
    eastern-most cluster on the dock piling. She''d learned to catalog everything
    before the scene changed—before tides shifted, evidence disappeared, or her own
    assumptions clouded what was actually there.


    The fishing village stretched behind her in shades of gray. Closed chowder shops.
    Boat hulls dark with brine. In Boston, she''d worked three homicides a month.
    Here in Mercy Point, Maine, she''d investigated two stolen lobster traps in five
    weeks.


    That was the idea. Slow down. Rebuild trust in her own judgment. Stop seeing patterns
    that weren''t there.


    The fog rolled in as she finished her documentation, thick enough to muffle the
    gulls'' cries. She didn''t mind it. Fog simplified things—reduced the world to
    what was immediately present, cut away distractions.


    "Detective Chen!"


    Harbor master Tom Whitmore jogged down the pier, his yellow slicker bright against
    the gray. "Body on Widow''s Beach. Tide brought it in an hour ago."


    Sarah''s hands moved automatically: camera secured, notebook pocketed, evidence
    kit retrieved from her truck. "Show me."


    The fog had settled like a wall by the time they reached the beach. Sarah knelt
    beside the body, pulling on gloves. Male, late forties, expensive watch still
    intact. Two days in the water, maybe three. She worked systematically—photographing
    the lividity pattern, checking pockets, noting the rope burns on the wrists.


    The fog shifted, and in the sudden clarity, she saw it.


    A tattoo on the inner forearm. Three interlocking circles.


    Her chest tightened. She knew that symbol. Knew what it meant.


    "That''s Jack Morrison," Whitmore said quietly from behind her. "Came up from
    Portland last week. Kept asking questions about boats, about people who''d left
    town."


    Sarah''s mind catalogued the facts automatically, even as her pulse hammered.
    Portland. The same city where her last case had collapsed. Where she''d followed
    a lead based on intuition instead of evidence, and an innocent man spent two weeks
    in custody before the real killer—


    "Did you speak with him?" Her voice remained level. Another skill she''d mastered.


    "Twice." Whitmore rubbed his jaw. "He seemed to know you were here. Asked if the
    new detective was thorough. If she finished what she started."


    The fog thickened again, obscuring the body''s face but not the tattoo. Sarah
    had seen that symbol before, carved into a warehouse wall where her Portland investigation
    had led. The case she''d abandoned when her methods failed her. When logic gave
    way to gut feeling, and gut feeling proved wrong.


    She photographed the tattoo from three angles.


    Morrison hadn''t come here by accident. Someone who knew her history, who knew
    that symbol''s significance, had sent him. Or followed him. The methodology was
    deliberate—the rope burns suggesting restraint before death, the tide calculation
    ensuring the body reached shore during her shift.


    "The fog," she said. "When does it usually clear?"


    "Midday, if we''re lucky. Could last all week, though. Weather''s turning."


    Sarah stared at the interlocking circles. In the fog, she couldn''t see the full
    beach, couldn''t see what other evidence might be waiting. But she could see this.
    This clear, undeniable connection to what she''d tried to leave behind.


    She could call Portland, hand this off, retreat again.


    Or she could stay. Work the scene. Trust her methods instead of her fears.


    The fog pressed close, waiting.


    Sarah opened her evidence kit and reached for the measuring tape.'

  content: '# The Tide''s Return


    Sarah photographed the barnacles first. Counterclockwise spiral, starting at the
    eastern-most cluster on the dock piling. She''d learned to catalog everything
    before the scene changed—before tides shifted, evidence disappeared, or her own
    assumptions clouded what was actually there.


    The fishing village stretched behind her in shades of gray. Closed chowder shops.
    Boat hulls dark with brine. In Boston, she''d worked three homicides a month.
    Here in Mercy Point, Maine, she''d investigated two stolen lobster traps in five
    weeks.


    That was the idea. Slow down. Rebuild trust in her own judgment. Stop seeing patterns
    that weren''t there.


    The fog rolled in as she finished her documentation, thick enough to muffle the
    gulls'' cries. She didn''t mind it. Fog simplified things—reduced the world to
    what was immediately present, cut away distractions.


    "Detective Chen!"


    Harbor master Tom Whitmore jogged down the pier, his yellow slicker bright against
    the gray. "Body on Widow''s Beach. Tide brought it in an hour ago."


    Sarah''s hands moved automatically: camera secured, notebook pocketed, evidence
    kit retrieved from her truck. "Show me."


    The fog had settled like a wall by the time they reached the beach. Sarah knelt
    beside the body, pulling on gloves. Male, late forties, expensive watch still
    intact. Two days in the water, maybe three. She worked systematically—photographing
    the lividity pattern, checking pockets, noting the rope burns on the wrists.


    The fog shifted, and there on the inner forearm: a tattoo. Three interlocking
    circles.


    Her chest tightened. She knew that symbol. Knew what it meant.


    "You recognize him?" Whitmore asked.


    Sarah photographed the tattoo from three angles, her breathing measured, each
    exhale counted before the next. "Name?"


    "Jack Morrison. Said he was visiting from Portland."


    Portland. The same city where her last case had collapsed. Where she''d followed
    intuition instead of evidence, and an innocent man spent two weeks in custody.


    "Did Morrison contact you before he arrived?" Sarah examined the rope burns again.
    Professional knots. Maritime knowledge.


    Whitmore shifted his weight. "He asked some questions at the harbor office."


    "What questions?" She looked up, met his eyes.


    "About boats. About people who''d left town." Whitmore''s jaw tightened. "About
    you."


    "What did you tell him?"


    "Nothing." Too quick. "Just that you were new here."


    Sarah stood, walked the perimeter of the body. The fog thickened, swallowing the
    far end of the beach where she could see disturbed sand—possible drag marks, possibly
    just tide. She''d need to process that area before the weather turned. "But you
    spoke with him more than once."


    "Twice."


    "And the second time?"


    Whitmore rubbed his jaw, a gesture she''d learned meant he was choosing his words
    carefully. "He asked if you were thorough. If you finished what you started."


    The symbol carved into the warehouse wall. Morrison''s face in the Portland case
    files—not a suspect, but a witness she''d never interviewed. Someone she''d missed
    in her rush to close the case.


    Sarah photographed the disturbed sand from her position, but the fog obscured
    the details. "When does this usually clear?"


    "Midday, if we''re lucky. Could last all week, though." Whitmore glanced at the
    gray wall surrounding them. "Weather''s turning."


    She couldn''t see what evidence the fog hid. Couldn''t see if someone stood watching
    from the bluffs above. The rope burns suggested restraint before death. The tide
    calculation ensured the body reached shore during her shift. Deliberate. Methodical.


    Someone had studied her methods and used them as a message.


    "Morrison came here looking for me," Sarah said. "Why didn''t you mention it when
    I transferred?"


    Whitmore''s silence was answer enough. He''d known Morrison. Had been protecting
    something—or someone.


    She could call Portland, hand this off, retreat again. Or she could stay. Work
    the scene despite what she couldn''t yet see. Trust her methods instead of her
    fears.


    The fog pressed close, concealing evidence she''d have to find.


    Sarah opened her evidence kit and reached for the measuring tape.'

    \n\nFEEDBACK: All constraints are satisfied, but the past case hint could be more\

    \ First Plot Point could hit harder if you delay the full tattoo recognition by\
    \ one beat. Show Sarah's physical reaction first (\"Her chest tightened\"), then\

    - Systematic perimeter work: \"Sarah stood, walked the perimeter of the body\"\
    \n- Deliberate questioning: Building Whitmore's testimony through layered questions\n\
    \nFEEDBACK: This is the story's strongest element. Sarah's voice is unmistakably\

    \ abruptly: \"The fog rolled in as she finished her documentation\" feels slightly\
    \ convenient. To deepen narrative purpose, consider having Sarah notice the fog\
    \ *during* her initial documentation—make her race against it rather than having\

    \ on-the-nose for reader understanding.\n\nFEEDBACK: Your prose is professionally\
    \ polished with excellent sentence rhythm. Two specific improvements:\n1. The\
    \ phrase \"That was the idea\" tells us Sarah came here intentionally—show this\
    \ through her choices instead. Perhaps her reaction to the stolen lobster traps\
    \ case reveals her humility?\n2. Trim the exposition in paragraph 3 (\"Stop seeing\

    \ precision later.\n\n---\n\nOVERALL_ASSESSMENT:\n\nThis is a strong submission\
    \ that satisfies all technical requirements while delivering compelling character\

  content: '# The Tide''s Return


    Sarah photographed the barnacles first. Counterclockwise spiral, starting at the
    eastern-most cluster on the dock piling. The fog was thickening from the harbor
    mouth, already obscuring the furthest pilings. She worked faster—clock, catalog,
    document—before the scene changed, before tides shifted or evidence disappeared.


    The fishing village stretched behind her in shades of gray. Closed chowder shops.
    Boat hulls dark with brine. She''d investigated two stolen lobster traps in five
    weeks. After Boston''s caseload, after everything that went wrong, the simplicity
    felt like permission to breathe.


    "Detective Chen!"


    Harbor master Tom Whitmore jogged down the pier, his yellow slicker bright against
    the gray. "Body on Widow''s Beach. Tide brought it in an hour ago."


    Sarah''s hands moved automatically: camera secured, notebook pocketed, evidence
    kit retrieved from her truck. "Show me."


    The fog had settled like a wall by the time they reached the beach. Sarah knelt
    beside the body, pulling on gloves. Male, late forties, expensive watch still
    intact. Two days in the water, maybe three. She worked systematically—photographing
    the lividity pattern, checking pockets, noting the rope burns on the wrists. The
    fog crept closer, eating the beach.


    Movement caught her eye. The fog shifted, and there on the inner forearm: a tattoo.


    Her chest tightened.


    Three interlocking circles.


    She knew that symbol. Knew what it meant.


    "You recognize him?" Whitmore asked.


    Sarah photographed the tattoo from three angles, her breathing measured, each
    exhale counted before the next. "Name?"


    "Jack Morrison. Said he was visiting from Portland."


    Portland. The warehouse wall, the symbol carved deep. The witness she''d never
    interviewed in her rush to close the case. The innocent man who''d spent two weeks
    in custody because she''d trusted her gut instead of the evidence.


    "Did Morrison contact you before he arrived?" Sarah examined the rope burns again.
    Professional knots. Maritime knowledge.


    Whitmore shifted his weight. "He asked some questions at the harbor office."


    "What questions?" She looked up, met his eyes.


    "About boats. About people who''d left town." Whitmore''s jaw tightened. "About
    you."


    "What did you tell him?"


    "Nothing." Too quick. "Just that you were new here."


    Sarah stood, walked the perimeter of the body. The fog thickened, swallowing the
    far end of the beach where she could see disturbed sand—possible drag marks, possibly
    just tide. She''d need to process that area now, before the weather stole it.
    "But you spoke with him more than once."


    "Twice."


    "And the second time?"


    Whitmore rubbed his jaw, a gesture she''d learned meant he was choosing his words
    carefully. "He asked if you were thorough. If you finished what you started."


    Morrison''s face in the Portland case files. The witness she''d missed. The connection
    she''d failed to make because she''d been too eager, too certain.


    Sarah photographed the disturbed sand from her position, but the fog obscured
    the details. She couldn''t see what evidence the gray wall hid. Couldn''t see
    if someone stood watching from the bluffs above. "When does this usually clear?"


    "Midday, if we''re lucky. Could last all week, though." Whitmore glanced at the
    encroaching gray. "Weather''s turning."


    The rope burns suggested restraint before death. The tide calculation ensured
    the body reached shore during her shift. Deliberate. Methodical. Someone had studied
    her methods and used them as a message.


    "Morrison came here looking for me," Sarah said. "Why didn''t you mention it when
    I transferred?"


    Whitmore''s silence was answer enough. He''d known Morrison. Had been protecting
    something—or someone.


    She could call Portland, hand this off, retreat again. Or she could stay. Work
    the scene despite what she couldn''t yet see. Trust her methods instead of her
    fears.


    The fog pressed close, concealing evidence she''d have to find.


    Sarah opened her evidence kit and reached for the measuring tape.'

    \ tattoo revelation comes quickly after identification. Consider adding one beat\
    \ of uncertainty (Sarah questioning if she's connecting the right dots) before\
    \ full recognition. This would heighten stakes and show her grappling with past\

    SCORE: 0.98\nEVIDENCE:\n- \"clock, catalog, document\" — rhythmic procedural thinking\n\
    - \"photographing the lividity pattern, checking pockets, noting the rope burns\"\

    \ is masterfully deployed. One area for enhancement: Sarah's emotional state could\
    \ merge more overtly with fog perception. The line \"The fog crept closer, eating\
    \ the beach\" is evocative—more moments like this that blur Sarah's internal dread\

    \ fog crept closer, eating the beach\" demonstrates stylistic control\n- Dialogue\
    \ efficiency: Information reveals character (Whitmore's pauses, his \"too quick\"\

    Couldn't see what evidence the gray wall hid. Couldn't see if someone stood watching\

    \ pressed close, concealing evidence she'd have to find\"\n\nFEEDBACK: The fog\
    \ is masterfully deployed. One area for enhancement: Sarah's emotional state could\
    \ merge more overtly with fog perception. The line \"The fog crept closer, eating\
    \ the beach\" is evocative—more moments like this that blur Sarah's internal dread\
    \ with weather description would strengthen thematic resonance. Current execution\

    Sarah photographed the barnacles first. Counterclockwise spiral, starting at the
    eastern-most cluster on the dock piling. The fog was thickening from the harbor
    mouth, already obscuring the furthest pilings. She worked faster—clock, catalog,
    document—before the scene changed, before tides shifted or evidence disappeared.


    The fishing village stretched behind her in shades of gray. Closed chowder shops.
    Boat hulls dark with brine. She''d investigated two stolen lobster traps in five
    weeks. After Boston''s caseload, after the name that wouldn''t leave the case
    file, the simplicity felt like permission to breathe.


    "Detective Chen!"


    Harbor master Tom Whitmore jogged down the pier, his yellow slicker bright against
    the gray. "Body on Widow''s Beach. Tide brought it in an hour ago."


    Sarah''s hands moved automatically: camera secured, notebook pocketed, evidence
    kit retrieved from her truck. "Show me."


    The fog had settled like a wall by the time they reached the beach. Sarah knelt
    beside the body, pulling on gloves. The sand was cold beneath her knees. Salt
    and decay. She cataloged the details—male, late forties, expensive watch still
    intact. Two days in the water, maybe three. She worked systematically: photographing
    the lividity pattern, checking pockets, noting the rope burns on the wrists. The
    fog crept closer, swallowing the shoreline behind her.


    Movement caught her eye. The fog shifted, and there on the inner forearm: a tattoo.


    Her chest tightened.


    Three interlocking circles.


    No. She was seeing patterns again. Connecting things that weren''t connected.
    She photographed it from three angles, her breathing measured, each exhale counted
    before the next. But the circles stayed. The same configuration. The same placement.


    She knew that symbol. Knew what it meant.


    "You recognize him?" Whitmore asked.


    "Name?"


    "Jack Morrison. Said he was visiting from Portland."


    Portland. The warehouse wall, the symbol carved deep. The witness she''d never
    interviewed because she''d been too certain, too eager to close the case.


    Sarah examined Morrison''s hands. The fog pressed against her back. She should
    check his fingernails, photograph the defensive wounds, but her fingers hesitated
    over his wrists. Had she missed something like this in Portland too? Rushed past
    evidence because she''d already decided what the story was?


    "Did Morrison contact you before he arrived?" She forced herself to continue the
    examination. Professional knots on the rope burns. Maritime knowledge.


    Whitmore shifted his weight. "He asked some questions at the harbor office."


    "What questions?" She looked up, met his eyes.


    "About boats. About people who''d left town." Whitmore''s jaw tightened. "About
    you."


    "What did you tell him?"


    "Nothing." Too quick. "Just that you were new here."


    Sarah stood, walked the perimeter of the body. The fog thickened, a gray wall
    consuming the far end of the beach where disturbed sand suggested drag marks—or
    just tide. She''d never know unless she processed that area now, before the weather
    erased it. Another incomplete investigation. "But you spoke with him more than
    once."


    "Twice."


    "And the second time?"


    Whitmore rubbed his jaw, a gesture she''d learned meant he was choosing his words
    carefully. "He asked if you were thorough. If you finished what you started."


    Morrison''s face in the Portland case files. The witness she''d missed. The connection
    she''d failed to make because she''d trusted her gut instead of the evidence.


    Sarah photographed the disturbed sand from her position, but the fog obscured
    the details. She couldn''t see what the gray concealed. Couldn''t see if someone
    stood watching from the bluffs above. "When does this usually clear?"


    "Midday, if we''re lucky. Could last all week, though." Whitmore glanced at the
    encroaching wall. "Weather''s turning."


    The rope burns suggested restraint before death. The tide calculation ensured
    the body reached shore during her shift. Deliberate. Methodical. Someone had studied
    her methods and used them as a message.


    "Morrison came here looking for me," Sarah said. "Why didn''t you mention it when
    I transferred?"


    Whitmore''s silence was answer enough. He''d known Morrison. Had been protecting
    something—or someone.


    She could call Portland, hand this off, retreat again. Or she could stay. Work
    the scene despite what she couldn''t yet see. Trust her methods instead of her
    fears.


    The fog pressed close, concealing evidence she''d have to find.


    Sarah opened her evidence kit and reached for the measuring tape.'
