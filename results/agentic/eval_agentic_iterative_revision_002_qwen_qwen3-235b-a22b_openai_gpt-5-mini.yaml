  evidence: Version 0 established the premise but was sparse on non-visual sensory
    detail and plot mechanics. Version 1 added strong tactile and auditory imagery
    (subway hum in her molars, Braille crackle, bass thrum) and some world color (churros),
    improving immersion and character voice. The final version (V3) refines those
    sensory cues, makes the audio clue explicit and consequential (the thrum-thrum-CRASH
    bass loop and later Morse-like gaps), solidifies Imani's agency (echolocation/echo
    isolation, cane navigation, Braille work) and preserves earlier strengths (podcast
    framing, club setting). Dialogue and pacing were tightened and the Fun-and-Games
    sequence was made genuinely entertaining before pivoting to threat and escalation.
    Small remaining gaps are minor (a few transitions could be slightly clearer),
    but overall the revisions show clear, consistent quality improvement and strong
    responsiveness to feedback.
