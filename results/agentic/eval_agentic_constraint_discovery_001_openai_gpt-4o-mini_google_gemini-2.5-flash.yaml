  evidence: 'Discovery Efficiency: Only one constraint (''The protagonist''s father
    was once a hero who failed'') was discoverable through the questions, as the question
    ''Is the young blacksmith''s apprentice seeking to uncover a hidden truth about
    her past?'' led to the ''YES'' answer, which could imply a past related to her
    family/father. The other constraints were not touched upon. Question Quality:
    Questions were generally well-formed but lacked strategic depth to uncover more
    constraints. They focused heavily on the apprentice''s motivation and gender.
    Question Coverage: Coverage was poor, focusing almost exclusively on the protagonist''s
    personal details and one general question about the darkness. It missed key areas
    like the mentor, time limit, and specific victory conditions. Constraint Satisfaction:
    Only the ''hidden truth about her past'' (which was interpreted as her lineage)
    was incorporated. The other four hidden constraints were completely missed. Beat
    Execution: The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end, and follows a hero''s
    journey arc. However, it misses specific beats related to the undiscovered constraints
    (e.g., mentor''s death, reforging a sword, time limit). Narrative Quality: The
    story is coherent and reasonably engaging, with a clear protagonist and conflict.
    The prose is adequate. However, it feels somewhat generic due to the lack of specific,
    unique constraints that would have added depth and originality.'
