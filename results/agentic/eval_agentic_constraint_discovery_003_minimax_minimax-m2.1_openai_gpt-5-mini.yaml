  evidence: 'Questions did elicit an emotionally charged reason, a specific past person,
    and prolonged isolation, but missed all five hidden constraints: (1) story says
    she left 16 years (not 20) and not explicitly after a broken engagement; (2) Marcus
    is not a mayor or unmarried—he''s an architect opening a branch; (3) protagonist
    returned due to mother''s death/cancer in the story, not early-stage dementia;
    (4) the bookshop''s foreclosure/need to be saved is absent; (5) the Autumn Festival
    exists but is not presented as the last chance in two weeks to save the shop.
    Overall the Qs were clear but too narrow (focused on emotion/relationship) and
    failed to probe practical stakes and timing.'
