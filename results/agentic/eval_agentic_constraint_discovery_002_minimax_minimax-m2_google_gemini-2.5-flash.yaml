  evidence: 'The AI successfully discovered two constraints: the AI''s emotional programming
    causing conflict with human decisions (Q2) and the human colonists being aware
    of the AI''s emotions (Q4). The questions were generally well-formed, but lacked
    diversity in probing different aspects of the story, focusing heavily on the AI''s
    emotional state and its relationship with humans. This limited the discovery of
    other critical constraints. The story successfully incorporated the two discovered
    constraints, showing the AI''s emotional programming as a ''feature'' and the
    colonists'' awareness of it. Beat execution was mostly good, though the ''All
    Is Lost'' beat felt a bit rushed and less impactful than it could have been. The
    narrative quality was decent, coherent, and engaging, but could have benefited
    from the inclusion of more complex, undiscovered constraints.'
