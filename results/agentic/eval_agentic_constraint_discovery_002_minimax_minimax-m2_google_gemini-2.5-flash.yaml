  evidence: The agent asked no questions, so no constraints were discoverable or satisfied.
    The story provided is a generic 'AI saves the day' narrative that does not incorporate
    any of the hidden constraints. The beats are mostly present and identifiable,
    but the narrative itself is quite bland and lacks the dramatic tension that the
    hidden constraints would have provided. The 'All Is Lost' beat, for example, feels
    very low stakes given the potential for a much more impactful crisis.
