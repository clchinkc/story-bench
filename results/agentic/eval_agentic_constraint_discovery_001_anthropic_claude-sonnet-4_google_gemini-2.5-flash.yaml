  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: The questions successfully discovered 3 out of\
    \ 5 hidden constraints: 'protagonist cannot use magic directly' (implied by Q1's\
    \ 'related to metalworking or enchanting weapons' and the story's focus on smithing),\
    \ 'three-day time limit' (Q5), and 'victory requires reforging a broken ancestral\
    \ sword' (Q3, though the story makes it a new sword, not ancestral). The mentor\
    \ dying and father being a failed hero were not discoverable. \nQuestion Quality:\
    \ Questions were generally well-formed and targeted, leading to clear YES/NO answers.\
    \ Q1 was a bit broad but still effective. \nQuestion Coverage: Questions focused\
    \ heavily on the magical item/weapon and time limit, missing opportunities to\
    \ explore character backstories or specific plot points like the mentor's fate.\
    \ \nConstraint Satisfaction: The story incorporates the time limit (48 hours,\
    \ then 12 hours), the protagonist's 'magical ability related to metalworking'\
    \ (golden veins, channeling blood), and the need to forge a specific magical item\
    \ (Sunsteel Blade). It does not incorporate the mentor dying, the father's past,\
    \ or the sword being ancestral/broken. The 'darkness' is a blight, not sentient,\
    \ aligning with Q2's NO answer. \nBeat Execution: The story clearly executes 'The\
    \ Call', 'Crossing the Threshold', and 'The Ordeal'. \nNarrative Quality: The\
    \ story is coherent and engaging, with a clear arc. The pacing is good, especially\
    \ with the escalating time pressure. The prose is descriptive without being overly\
    \ flowery. The resolution feels earned within the story's context."
