  evidence: The questions successfully discovered 4 out of 5 constraints. The question
    'Is there a significant past relationship that the protagonist must confront in
    the story?' led to the discovery of the former fiance. 'Is the protagonist's bookshop
    struggling financially, adding pressure to their personal journey?' discovered
    the struggling bookshop. 'Is there a specific event during the autumn festival
    that serves as a catalyst for the climax?' discovered the festival as a last chance.
    'Is the protagonist's return to their hometown tied to a family obligation or
    event?' discovered the mother's dementia (though the story changed it to an aunt's
    passing). The constraint about the former fiance being the mayor and still unmarried
    was not directly discovered by the questions, nor was the 20-year absence. The
    story incorporates the struggling bookshop, the festival as a catalyst, and a
    family event (though altered). It introduces a past relationship but doesn't make
    the former fiance the mayor or unmarried. The narrative is coherent but deviates
    from some key hidden constraints, particularly the specific nature of the past
    relationship and the reason for return (mother's dementia vs. aunt's passing).
    The beats are present and generally well-executed, but the story feels a bit generic
    due to the missed specific constraints.
