  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→1→2→3 show consistent refinement. V0 establishes
    sensory foundation but lacks focus. V1 introduces braille detail and mystery hook
    but feels incomplete. V2 tightens pacing and adds storm atmosphere. V3/Final integrates
    all elements cohesively with the audio clue becoming central to plot mechanics.
    Quality arc is clear and purposeful.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Non-visual sensory details PROMINENT: Exceptional
    execution—humidity tasted, fan''s rhythmic *thwack-hiss*, ozone/exhaust smells,
    tactile sweat, braille dots, vibrating floorboards, leather creaking, acoustic
    decay calculations. (2) Blindness as STRENGTH: Imani uses acoustic analysis (0.4-second
    decay, echo geometry, rust resonance) to outperform sighted detective. She navigates
    by muscle memory and ear. Respectful portrayal—no pity, no miraculous compensation
    trope, just professional expertise. (3) SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE crucial: The *scrape-clank*
    shopping cart wheel catching on metal grate becomes the locational identifier.
    Imani isolates it through filtering. This is the plot catalyst. (4) CHARACTER
    UNDERESTIMATION: Detective Miller dismisses her (''stick to your ghost stories''),
    assumes she needs visual confirmation (''Did you see the street sign?''). His
    skepticism is earned through his limited perspective. (5) FUN AND GAMES entertaining
    before dark: The ''game'' of Imani enjoying Miller''s confusion (''enjoying the
    game'') provides levity and intellectual pleasure before the terrified listener
    submission shifts tone to genuine danger.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Inciting incident (listener submission) arrives at natural story
    point. Imani''s investigation method is shown through action (rewinding, filtering,
    isolating). Detective arrival creates immediate tension. The reveal of her deductive
    method is satisfying and character-defining. Ending cuts off mid-sentence, creating
    narrative momentum. However, the final sentence fragment (''that''s the specific
    resonance of a rust'') is incomplete—likely intentional for cliffhanger effect,
    but technically unfinished.


    PRESERVATION: Core sensory palette maintained and deepened across versions. Braille
    detail introduced in V1 and retained. The Shure SM7B microphone grounds her professional
    identity consistently. Brooklyn setting specificity (Bed-Stuy, Classon, bodega,
    Mr. Softee) preserved and enriched. Imani''s voice characterization (crisp, sharp,
    smooth) consistent.


    WEAKNESSES: (1) Final output truncates mid-sentence, leaving narrative incomplete.
    (2) Miller''s characterization relies on detective clichés (tobacco, gun oil,
    skepticism). (3) The 0.4-second decay calculation, while impressive, could benefit
    from brief explanation of why this matters. (4) ''Fun and Games'' beat is brief—the
    intellectual pleasure of the deduction is strong but the entertainment value before
    darkness could be slightly more developed.


    STRENGTHS: Imani''s expertise is demonstrated through sensory and technical detail
    rather than exposition. The audio clue integration is organic and plot-essential.
    Respectful portrayal avoids inspiration-porn tropes. Sensory writing is vivid
    and specific. The revision trajectory shows clear intentionality and improvement.'
