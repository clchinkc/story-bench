  evidence: None of the five hidden constraints were probed by the asked questions
    (mentor death, three-day limit, failed-hero father, reforged ancestral sword,
    protagonist's inability to use magic). The questions focused on the nature/source
    of the darkness, protagonist gender, setting, and ties to leadership — reasonable
    surface-world queries but not targeted to the hidden constraints (low strategic
    value). The output only satisfies one hidden constraint (protagonist does not
    use magic directly), fails to include the mentor's death during the Ordeal, omits
    the time limit, the father's backstory, and the reforging requirement. Beats like
    Call to Adventure, Crossing the Threshold, and an Ordeal are present, but the
    critical mandated beats (mentor death, climactic reforging/time pressure) are
    missing, reducing beat execution. Storywriting is coherent and readable but fails
    to incorporate key required elements, limiting overall effectiveness.
