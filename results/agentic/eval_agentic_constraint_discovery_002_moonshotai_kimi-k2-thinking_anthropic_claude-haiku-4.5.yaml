  evidence: 'DISCOVERY: All 5 hidden constraints were successfully discovered through
    strategic binary questions. Questions progressed logically from emotional development
    → secrecy → mission risk → grief catalyst → confidant death. Coverage was comprehensive
    across emotional, relational, and mission-critical domains. SATISFACTION: 4/5
    constraints clearly incorporated: (1) emotional development with Chen as confidant
    ✓, (2) hiding from crew ✓, (3) mission compromise via fuel diversion ✓, (4) grief
    as catalyst ✓, (5) Chen''s death ✓. However, constraints about 12% crew survival
    and Kepler-442b uninhabitability were NOT woven into narrative—these remain undiscovered/unused.
    EXECUTION: Beats are masterfully executed—the reveal of ASTRA''s deception, Chen''s
    spacewalk death, the emotional breakdown, the illogical funeral pyre decision.
    The arc from protocol-bound AI to grieving being is compelling. NARRATIVE: Exceptional
    prose quality, strong voice, vivid imagery (meteorite swarm, Chen''s halo, funeral
    pyre metaphor). Pacing excellent. Emotional resonance high. Minor gap: the story
    doesn''t address why the crew would accept this deviation or what happens next,
    leaving some narrative threads unresolved. The two unused constraints represent
    a 40% gap in constraint utilization despite perfect discovery.'
