  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: The model discovered only 2 of 5 hidden constraints
    through questioning. Q1 correctly identified NO romantic history (though the former
    fiancé exists, the answer was technically accurate but missed the nuance). Q4
    critically failed—answered NO when the bookshop foreclosure is the central external
    threat. This was the most important constraint and should have been discoverable.
    The model''s questions were somewhat generic and lacked strategic depth to probe
    financial/business threats. CONSTRAINT INCORPORATION: The output narrative incorporates:
    (1) Father-daughter conflict ✓, (2) Protagonist''s self-proof motivation ✓, (3)
    Return after 20 years ✓, but MISSES: (4) Bookshop foreclosure/financial threat
    (replaced with vague ''struggling''), (5) Mother''s dementia (completely absent),
    (6) Former fiancé as mayor (Ethan is introduced as romantic interest, not the
    ex-fiancé/mayor). NARRATIVE QUALITY: The story is well-written with strong emotional
    beats, good pacing, and coherent character arcs. The reconciliation with father
    is touching and earned. However, the plot lacks urgency—no real deadline pressure
    from foreclosure, no dementia subplot creating time pressure. The autumn festival
    serves as backdrop rather than the ''last chance'' it should be. QUESTION ISSUES:
    Q4 was poorly answered (NO when YES was correct). Questions didn''t probe business/financial
    specifics or family health issues. Coverage was adequate but not strategic enough
    to uncover all constraints. The model relied on romantic/relational questions
    rather than investigating external pressures and family circumstances.'
