  evidence: "CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.72): The revisions show selective engagement\
    \ with feedback. Critiques consistently flagged youth_voice concerns around abstract\
    \ narrator observations ('Hope was basically her video game'). The final output\
    \ partially addresses this by replacing that line with 'That had to be what hope\
    \ felt like'—more grounded in Zara's physical sensation ('ribs fizz, like soda\
    \ bubbles'). However, some abstract constructions remain ('Alphabet game' as distraction\
    \ technique feels slightly narratorial). The writer preserved strong authentic\
    \ moments ('I'm twelve, not two,' swearing then wincing) but didn't systematically\
    \ eliminate all adult-narrator intrusions. Responsiveness is moderate rather than\
    \ thorough.\n\nIMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.65): Versions 1-3 appear nearly identical\
    \ in the provided text, suggesting minimal iterative refinement across revisions.\
    \ The opening remains unchanged across all versions. The most significant improvement\
    \ appears between VERSION 0 and VERSION 1 (Gull-Glider description sharpened:\
    \ 'stole wind and turned it into trickles' → 'stole wind and fed it into the battered\
    \ tablet'). However, the plateau after VERSION 1 indicates diminishing returns.\
    \ Quality didn't demonstrably escalate; rather, it stabilized at a solid level.\
    \ This is adequate but not exceptional trajectory work.\n\nPRESERVATION (0.78):\
    \ Strengths were well-maintained: the Gull-Glider invention remains vivid and\
    \ age-appropriate; Calderon's specific phobia (fear of drowning, life vest indoors)\
    \ persists as a meaningful flaw; the crossing dangers (siphon, catwalk, rising\
    \ water) stay genuinely threatening; Zara's voice retains physicalized emotion\
    \ and authentic 12-year-old irritation. The Hero's Journey structure remained\
    \ intact. Minor weakness: some early-draft sensory details may have been lost\
    \ in compression, though the final version compensates with strong moments like\
    \ 'metal whined under their weight' and 'electricity zinging through her chest.'\n\
    \nCONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.92 / 5 of 5):\n1. ✓ Competence without unrealism:\
    \ Zara jury-rigs solutions (Gull-Glider antenna splice, dinghy modifications)\
    \ but fails at first weld attempt, needs bartering, struggles with rope burns.\
    \ She's capable but bounded.\n2. ✓ Adult dismissal: Foreman Birk explicitly dismisses\
    \ her ('Storm's coming, kid. Go fly your kites somewhere safe'), then is proven\
    \ wrong ('Guess the kid did it').\n3. ✓ Flawed mentor: Calderon's specific phobia\
    \ (near-drowning trauma, life vest indoors, three buckets between toes and water)\
    \ is vivid and creates genuine tension. She's not just cautious; she's traumatized.\n\
    4. ✓ Invention demonstrating ingenuity: Gull-Glider (grocery bags + drone rotors\
    \ + wind-to-power conversion) is clever, scavenged-materials appropriate, and\
    \ serves plot function (powers antenna upload).\n5. ✓ Real danger in crossing:\
    \ Siphon creates genuine threat (water surge, rising tunnel, physical struggle).\
    \ Not token—characters nearly lose equipment, must make life-or-death choice (cubes\
    \ or crew), and barely escape. Water reaches thighs; antenna upload is cut close\
    \ (96% → complete).\n\nBEAT EXECUTION (0.88): Hero's Journey beats are present\
    \ and functional:\n- Ordinary World: ✓ Shallows, barrel fires, ration boats, tablet\
    \ charging\n- Call to Adventure: ✓ Archive discovery, 72-hour countdown, clear\
    \ stakes\n- Refusal/Meeting Mentor: ✓ Birk dismisses; Calderon listens but hesitates\
    \ (phobia revealed)\n- Preparation: ✓ Dinghy rehab, failed weld, bartering, creative\
    \ modifications\n- Crossing Threshold: ✓ Green dawn, breaker through skylight,\
    \ escalator waterfall, rappel\n- Tests/Trials: ✓ Siphon catwalk (alphabet game\
    \ distraction), cave-in, rising water\n- Inner Chamber: ✓ Failed cubes, successful\
    \ seed printers, antenna splice\n- Resurrection: ✓ Upload race against flood,\
    \ choice between equipment and life\n- Return: ✓ City buzzing with blueprints,\
    \ Birk's acknowledgment, Calderon's homework assignment, Zara's joy\n\nMinor gap:\
    \ 'Refusal of Call' beat is compressed (Birk dismisses but Zara immediately pivots\
    \ to Calderon). This is acceptable for pacing but slightly underplayed.\n\nNARRATIVE\
    \ QUALITY (0.85): Strengths include vivid worldbuilding (New Boston's floating\
    \ shanties, rust-streaked infrastructure, glow-kelp jars, mesh radios), authentic\
    \ dialogue ('I'm twelve, not two,' 'Alphabet game!'), high-stakes action sequences\
    \ with clear spatial logic (tunnel navigation, catwalk physics), and earned emotional\
    \ beats (Calderon's betrayal/forgiveness, Zara's grin). The ending balances hope\
    \ without saccharine: blueprints are projected, people argue 'in a good way,'\
    \ but the storm still threatens (turbines 'slice storm wind'). \n\nWeaknesses:\
    \ Some exposition feels slightly rushed (Calderon's backstory compressed into\
    \ one line). The 'Alphabet game' distraction, while creative, borders on cutesy.\
    \ The final line ('electricity zinging through her chest') echoes earlier 'ribs\
    \ fizz' metaphor—effective but slightly repetitive. These are minor; overall execution\
    \ is strong."
