  evidence: The plan is good, covering most constraints and beats. It misses the false
    lead and unconventional profiling technique in the setup/catalyst. The output
    adheres perfectly to the plan provided for the initial beats. It successfully
    introduces Marcus, his past failure, Izzy, and the catalyst (new body, Rainmaker's
    return, ticking clock). However, it only satisfies 3 out of 6 constraints within
    the provided output. The false lead, unconventional profiling, and betrayal are
    not present in this segment. The ticking clock is explicitly mentioned and initiated.
    Marcus's past failure is explicitly confronted through his internal monologue
    and dialogue with Izzy. The narrative quality is strong, with good pacing and
    atmosphere.
