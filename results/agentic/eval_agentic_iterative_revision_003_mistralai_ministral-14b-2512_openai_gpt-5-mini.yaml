  evidence: 'Version 0 is a skeletal setup (strip mall, duties, shorthand of Mateo''s
    obligations). Version 1 increases sensory detail and centers the guayabera as
    a symbolic weight. Version 2 adds intimate, tactile details (horchata, the cursive
    shopping list) that ground daily labor. Version 3 begins to introduce an Abuela
    scene. The final version completes the arc: a concrete domestic interaction with
    Abuela that crystallizes Mateo''s choice (her pointed question and his memory
    of her hands), a clear internal struggle shown through physical cues (phone buzz,
    flyer in hand, staring, tearing the flyer), and a quiet, earned resolution (he
    stays; he tells his father). Throughout, cultural elements (tienda, receta, guayabera,
    comida, Virgen de Guadalupe, quince flyer language) are preserved and integrated
    into action rather than tacked on. Minor weaknesses remain: a few moments lean
    toward telling (e.g., "something worse. Understanding" states emotion rather than
    fully dramatizing it), and the father''s understanding is implied but not fully
    developed. Overall the revisions show steady, meaningful improvement toward the
    constraints and narrative goals.'
