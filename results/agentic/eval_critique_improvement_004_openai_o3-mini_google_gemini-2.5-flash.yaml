  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on character interiority, suggesting it
    was too expository and not shown through action. The revisions, particularly from
    V2 to V3 and the final output, show a clear effort to address this. Phrases like
    'tender brush of his hand along the brick wall' and 'grip on his walking stick
    tightened until his knuckles whitened' are good examples of showing interiority
    through action. The 'quiet longing' mentioned in Critique 3 was largely replaced
    by more active expressions of Teddy's inner state. The overall quality improved
    significantly, especially in the specificity of Teddy's routine and the emotional
    depth conveyed through subtle details. Strengths like the evocative prose were
    maintained while weaknesses in showing interiority were addressed.
