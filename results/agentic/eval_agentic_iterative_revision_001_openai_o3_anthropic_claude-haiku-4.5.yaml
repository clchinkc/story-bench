  evidence: 'VERSION 0-2 appear truncated/identical, making trajectory assessment
    challenging, but VERSION 3→FINAL shows exceptional refinement. Competence established
    immediately through concrete actions (rerouting teams, ventilator calibration
    with specific 0.3-second rise-time detail) before flaw emerges (vacant reflection,
    spreadsheet loneliness, phone devoid of personal contacts). Friendship with Mrs.
    Patel feels genuinely earned through four days of incremental connection—tea,
    breathing exercises, shared stories—rather than sudden intimacy. Medical detail
    (incentive spirometer, bilateral pneumonia, diaphragmatic breathing counts) integrates
    naturally into narrative rather than feeling inserted. Transformation is purely
    internal: Elena''s external competence unchanged, but her awareness shifts (silencing
    pager, choosing stairs, questioning her own motivations). Final ambiguity is masterfully
    executed—the stairwell question (''had she chosen the stairs for quiet, or merely
    calculated the faster route?'') leaves reader uncertain whether Elena has genuinely
    changed or simply become self-aware of her patterns without altering them. The
    sage seed metaphor and N.P.''s note provide thematic resonance without resolving
    the ambiguity. Prose quality elevated in final version: ''sliced through'' vs.
    ''strode,'' ''chest rose like a curtain on cue,'' ''Loneliness, rendered as a
    spreadsheet cell''—language becomes more precise and metaphorically rich. All
    five constraints satisfied: competence shown first (opening 3 paragraphs), friendship
    earned (4-day progression), transformation internal (awareness without behavioral
    change), specific medical detail integrated (rise-time dial, spirometer, bilateral
    pneumonia, diaphragmatic breathing), ending with genuine ambiguity (stairwell
    question unresolved).'
