  evidence: 'The plan is very detailed and covers all constraints and beats. The execution
    largely follows the plan, with minor deviations that don''t detract from the story.
    All 6 constraints are met: false lead (community kitchen), unconventional profiling
    (sentiment analysis/rainfall), ticking clock (three more rains), betrayal (Elena),
    direct confrontation (Midpoint call with killer), and past failure (Sam''s death).
    All 4 beats are clearly present and well-executed. The narrative quality is high,
    with good pacing, tension, and character voice.'
