  evidence: 'Across rounds the story moved from a strong surface specificity to richer
    interiority and relational stakes. Early critiques noted limited interior access
    (scores cited: 0.68, 0.75, 0.85); the final revision answers those points by adding
    sensory, bodily detail (hand to chest, lifted foot, breath held), memories of
    Diane (humming, funeral) and clear hesitation about Marcus''s porch. The construction
    disruption concretely reveals Teddy''s avoidance of intimacy/letting go, and Marcus''s
    neighbor-arc intersects and helps change him. The new route delivers what the
    old could not: actual human connection, shared small tasks (watering tomatoes,
    coffee), and the possibility of trying again—elements absent on the old loop.
    Story Circle beats are present and functional (YOU/NEED/GO/SEARCH/RETURN with
    FIND/CHANGE woven into SEARCH and RETURN), and prose largely conveys emotion through
    action and detail rather than exposition.'
