  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q1 confirmed the love interest was a former romantic
    partner (✓). Q2 confirmed family emergency/inheritance (✓). Q3 confirmed inheritance
    condition (✓). However, Q4''s NO answer obscured that the love interest is the
    MAYOR (a key identity detail), and Q5''s NO answer prevented discovery that the
    mother''s dementia is the actual reason for return (the inheritance was secondary
    motivation). The questions missed the 20-year timeline and the 2-week festival
    deadline specificity. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were logically sound and well-formed,
    but lacked strategic depth. Q4 and Q5 were somewhat predictable follow-ups that
    didn''t probe deeper into character relationships or time pressure. Better questions
    would have asked about the protagonist''s family situation directly or the love
    interest''s current role in town. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: The narrative successfully
    incorporates 4 of 5 discovered constraints: (1) Former romantic relationship with
    Julian ✓, (2) Inheritance as return reason ✓, (3) Inheritance condition (profit
    margin for Gala) ✓, (4) Autumn festival timing ✓. The mother''s dementia is entirely
    absent—a significant omission that weakens emotional stakes. The mayor detail
    is missing, reducing Julian''s complexity. BEAT EXECUTION: Story hits all major
    narrative beats effectively: reunion, rising tension, climactic challenge, resolution
    with emotional payoff. The power outage creates genuine stakes. The ending balances
    external victory (shop saved) with internal victory (relationship rekindled).
    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Exceptional prose quality, strong atmospheric writing, well-paced
    tension, and satisfying emotional arc. The story is engaging and coherent, though
    it would be richer with the missing mother subplot adding urgency and emotional
    weight.'
