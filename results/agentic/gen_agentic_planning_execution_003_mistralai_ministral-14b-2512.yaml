    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations

    **The Last Meal at Park’s Kitchen**


    The kitchen of *Park’s Kitchen* was already alive when David arrived before dawn.
    The hiss of gas burners, the clatter of metal spoons against cast-iron pans, the
    scent of garlic and soy sauce simmering into the morning—it was his world, the
    only one left intact after twenty-five years of standing still. He moved through
    the familiar space like a man half-asleep, tying Eunice’s old red apron around
    his waist, the one she’d worn the day she last walked behind the stove. The third
    place setting at the counter remained, its silverware tarnished from disuse. David
    set it anyway, as he had every night since the cancer diagnosis, every night since
    the funeral, every night since Mira stopped picking up his calls.


    The *doenjang jjigae*—her favorite—was already on the burner, too long simmered.
    The paste had thickened into a bitter glaze, the texture wrong. He turned down
    the flame, but the damage was done. He’d burned it, just like he’d burned the
    toast last week, just like he’d let the *tteokbokki* sit too near the heat until
    the rice cakes curled at the edges. Eunice’s hands would have known how to fix
    it. Instead, he stood there, stirring the pot with the flat of his knife, watching
    the blackened broth clump against the blade.


    A shadow fell across the counter. Mr. Kim, his hands wrapped in a faded green
    scarf, had slipped in. The old man always came before the other customers, before
    the breakfast rush, before the world had a chance to wake and remind David of
    what he’d lost.


    “Breakfast today?” David asked, though he already knew the answer.


    Mr. Kim nodded. “Same as yesterday. *Gyeran jjim* and *kimchi.*”


    David exhaled, turning back to the stove. The eggs would be soft, the way Eunice
    liked them. He cracked two into a bowl, wincing as the shell caught the edge of
    the whisk. *Breakfast was her domain.* Twenty-five years ago, she’d arrived at
    the restaurant with a battered copy of *The Silver Spoon* and a dream of feeding
    the neighborhood. David, then a line cook at another establishment, had been nothing
    but a reluctant groom when she’d lured him into her family’s business. But she’d
    loved it here—loved the way the steam curled around the open door in winter, loved
    the laughter of regulars who became friends, loved the way David’s hands, rougher
    than hers, still trembled when he held a whisk. Now, the eggs were just another
    thing he couldn’t do right.


    ---


    The demolition notice arrived folded into a manila envelope, the weight of it
    too final to ignore. David had seen the city’s bulldozers before, chewing through
    brick and mortar like they were made of paper. But this time, the pink slip in
    his hand bore *Park’s Kitchen* in bold letters at the top. The offer was generous—$250,000—but
    he didn’t care about money. He cared about the scent of *gamja jjigae* lingering
    in the walls, the way the floorboards creaked under foot from years of Eunice’s
    laughter. He cared about the third chair at the counter, the one that would never
    be used again.


    That afternoon, his phone buzzed. Mira. He hesitated before answering.


    “So,” she said, her voice sharp through the line. “I’m coming to Chicago.”


    David’s grip tightened on the whisk he’d been polishing. “You are?”


    “Next Friday. I’ll stay at the apartment. You haven’t changed the locks since
    Mom died, right? I’d hate to be locked out.”


    “You haven’t called in four years,” he said.


    “Yeah, well. Things got *messy.*” A pause. “This isn’t about me, though. It’s
    about you selling this place and pretending like nothing ever happened.”


    The whisk slipped from his fingers, clattering against the sink. “I can’t just—”


    “Move?” she snapped. “You never *could.* But Dad, you’re not getting any younger.
    And this—this is just a building.”


    ---


    The restaurant had changed. The neighborhood was changing. The kids who once sneaked
    in for *hotteok* now played with the bulldozers’ ropes. The young couples who’d
    ordered *makguksu* on lazy Sundays were gone, replaced by takeout menus and plastic-wrapped
    meals from corporate chains. Only Mr. Kim lingered, his presence a quiet testament
    to the years that had slipped away.


    David spent the week like a man drowning in memories. He remeasured the space
    for the third time, traced Eunice’s handwriting in the ledger, and found himself
    humming the old *pansori* songs she used to sing while plating rice. The customers
    came and went, but he barely heard them. His focus was on the stove, on the food,
    on the things he could still control. He made *kimbap* with practiced hands, but
    the rice was cold by the time he cut into it. He fried *bindaetteok* until the
    beans were crisp, but the sauce tasted flat.


    Mira arrived before the dinner rush. She wore a sleek black blazer, her hair pulled
    into a tight bun—too California, too polished for this place.


    “You look like you’re ready for a job interview,” David said, wiping his hands
    on his apron.


    “I *am.*” She set her bag on the counter. “I interviewed the city council. They’re
    not budging on the demolition. You’ve got a week to decide.”


    David opened his mouth, but no words came. Instead, he turned to the fridge and
    pulled out the jar of *gochujang*—Eunice’s special batch, the one she’d bought
    from that old man in the market who swore his chili was grown in the shadow of
    the Han River. He tossed it onto the counter between them. Mira caught it before
    it could roll off.


    “What’s this for?”


    David’s hands trembled. “Nothing.”


    She unscrewed the lid and sniffed. “You haven’t made anything with this in years.”


    “I *used* to,” he admitted.


    Mira’s eyes flickered with something like understanding. She set the jar down.
    “I found her recipe book. Hiding in the back of the pantry.”


    David froze. The book hadn’t been there since Eunice’s death. He hadn’t touched
    it—couldn’t bear to. “Where?”


    “It’s got her notes in the margins.” Mira’s voice was softer now. “She wrote *park’s
    special* next to the *doenjang jjigae.*”


    David’s breath hitched. The recipe that had been Eunice’s, that he’d stolen away
    with her absence. He’d refused to cook it, as if doing so would be a betrayal.


    “You want to make it?” Mira asked. “Before—you know. Before the demo guys come.”


    David stared at her. The daughter he barely recognized, the one who’d blamed him
    for everything, was offering him a chance to say goodbye. Not with words. Not
    with tears. With fire, with flavor, with the ghosts of what had been.


    ---


    That evening, the restaurant smelled like it used to. The rich, earthy tang of
    fermented soybeans, the sharp bite of chili, the deep umami of Eunice’s broth.
    David had followed the recipe exactly—*too exactly*—and the *kimchi jjigae* was
    perfect, the way it should have been. But the pot was half-empty when he lifted
    the lid. The rest had been burned, charred onto the bottom in a blackened crust.


    Mira watched him from the counter, her face unreadable. “It’s like she’s haunting
    the stove.”


    David let out a laugh, bitter and broken. “She used to say the same thing about
    me.”


    Mr. Kim shuffled in, his scarf now gone, replaced by a thin blue sweater. He didn’t
    speak. Just nodded at the pot, then at the empty third place setting.


    David sighed, setting down a bowl. “One more time. For old times’ sake.”


    The old man sat, his hands folded around the ceramic. He took a spoonful, chewed
    slowly. Then another. David waited.


    “It’s good, David-san,” Mr. Kim said at last. “But it’s not *her.*”


    David’s chest ached. “I know.”


    Mira slid into the chair beside them. “Eat with us, Mr. Kim.”


    The old man hesitated, then nodded. “Then let’s finish it properly.”


    They ate in silence, the *kimchi jjigae* cooling between them. Outside, the neon
    sign flickered—*PARK’S KITCHEN*—its letters worn but still proud.


    ---


    Friday came too soon. David stood in the doorway as the demo crew rolled in, their
    truck parked where his daughter’s old bicycle used to rest. Mira was at his side,
    her blazer gone, her hair down. She’d come to help, after all.


    “You’re really doing this?” she asked.


    David looked at the building, at the years pressed into its walls. Then at the
    small, battered cart he’d found at an auction—Eunice’s old *pojangmacha* stand,
    the one she’d dragged him to after work when they’d first met. He’d painted it
    fresh, added a new menu, a new sign.


    “No,” he said. “But I’ve got to move.”


    Mira’s breath caught. “Dad—”


    He turned to her, his voice steady. “I’m not selling. I’m starting over.”


    She studied him, then reached into her bag. “I found her notes. All of them.”
    She pressed a stack of index cards into his hand—Eunice’s recipes, her secrets,
    her laughter on paper. “She said you’d know what to do.”


    David looked at the cards, then at the bulldozers. He thought of Eunice’s hands,
    of the way she’d always known how to fix the burn in a pot of *jjigae.* He thought
    of Mr. Kim, of the stories he’d finally let himself tell. And he thought of Mira,
    the daughter who’d carried her own grief like a weight, who’d come back not to
    fight him, but to help.


    The city’s offer was still on the table. But David had his own plan now.


    “Come on,” he said, tugging her toward the cart. “Let’s make something new.”


    Outside, Mr. Kim waited with a small cooler. He nodded as they approached. “You’ll
    need this. *Bingsu* fixings. For the street.”


    David laughed, the sound foreign but right. “You came.”


    “Of course.” Mr. Kim’s eyes were bright. “Eunice would have wanted it this way.”


    They set up by the construction site, the cart a beacon of what remained. David
    scooped shaved ice into bowls, Mira drizzled honey and sweetened milk, Mr. Kim
    sprinkled crushed *chwa* cookies. The bulldozer paused. A young family, displaced
    by the noise, wandered over.


    David handed them a spoon. “First one’s on the house.”


    Mira watched as the customers dug in, as the ice melted into something sweet and
    cold. She reached for David’s hand. He squeezed hers back.


    The cart was small. The future was uncertain. But the food was good.


    And for the first time in years, David felt like he was moving forward.'

  were crisp, but the sauce tasted flat.


  Mira arrived before the dinner rush. She wore a sleek black blazer, her hair pulled
  into a tight bun—too California, too polished for this place.


  “You look like you’re ready for a job interview,” David said, wiping his hands on
  his apron.


  “I *am.*” She set her bag on the counter. “I interviewed the city council. They’re
  not budging on the demolition. You’ve got a week to decide.”


  David opened his mouth, but no words came. Instead, he turned to the fridge and
  pulled out the jar of *gochujang*—Eunice’s special batch, the one she’d bought from
  that old man in the market who swore his chili was grown in the shadow of the Han
  River. He tossed it onto the counter between them. Mira caught it before it could
  roll off.


  “What’s this for?”


  David’s hands trembled. “Nothing.”


  She unscrewed the lid and sniffed. “You haven’t made anything with this in years.”


  “I *used* to,” he admitted.


  Mira’s eyes flickered with something like understanding. She set the jar down. “I
  found her recipe book. Hiding in the back of the pantry.”


  David froze. The book hadn’t been there since Eunice’s death. He hadn’t touched
  it—couldn’t bear to. “Where?”


  “It’s got her notes in the margins.” Mira’s voice was softer now. “She wrote *park’s
  special* next to the *doenjang jjigae.*”


  David’s breath hitched. The recipe that had been Eunice’s, that he’d stolen away
  with her absence. He’d refused to cook it, as if doing so would be a betrayal.


  “You want to make it?” Mira asked. “Before—you know. Before the demo guys come.”


  David stared at her. The daughter he barely recognized, the one who’d blamed him
  for everything, was offering him a chance to say goodbye. Not with words. Not with
  tears. With fire, with flavor, with the ghosts of what had been.

  That evening, the restaurant smelled like it used to. The rich, earthy tang of fermented
  soybeans, the sharp bite of chili, the deep umami of Eunice’s broth. David had followed
  the recipe exactly—*too exactly*—and the *kimchi jjigae* was perfect, the way it
  should have been. But the pot was half-empty when he lifted the lid. The rest had
  been burned, charred onto the bottom in a blackened crust.


  Mira watched him from the counter, her face unreadable. “It’s like she’s haunting
  the stove.”


  David let out a laugh, bitter and broken. “She used to say the same thing about
  me.”


  Mr. Kim shuffled in, his scarf now gone, replaced by a thin blue sweater. He didn’t
  speak. Just nodded at the pot, then at the empty third place setting.


  David sighed, setting down a bowl. “One more time. For old times’ sake.”


  The old man sat, his hands folded around the ceramic. He took a spoonful, chewed
  slowly. Then another. David waited.


  “It’s good, David-san,” Mr. Kim said at last. “But it’s not *her.*”


  David’s chest ached. “I know.”


  Mira slid into the chair beside them. “Eat with us, Mr. Kim.”


  The old man hesitated, then nodded. “Then let’s finish it properly.”


  They ate in silence, the *kimchi jjigae* cooling between them. Outside, the neon
  sign flickered—*PARK’S KITCHEN*—its letters worn but still proud.

  Friday came too soon. David stood in the doorway as the demo crew rolled in, their
  truck parked where his daughter’s old bicycle used to rest. Mira was at his side,
  her blazer gone, her hair down. She’d come to help, after all.


  “You’re really doing this?” she asked.


  David looked at the building, at the years pressed into its walls. Then at the small,
  battered cart he’d found at an auction—Eunice’s old *pojangmacha* stand, the one
  she’d dragged him to after work when they’d first met. He’d painted it fresh, added
  a new menu, a new sign.


  “No,” he said. “But I’ve got to move.”


  Mira’s breath caught. “Dad—”


  He turned to her, his voice steady. “I’m not selling. I’m starting over.”


  She studied him, then reached into her bag. “I found her notes. All of them.” She
  pressed a stack of index cards into his hand—Eunice’s recipes, her secrets, her
  laughter on paper. “She said you’d know what to do.”


  David looked at the cards, then at the bulldozers. He thought of Eunice’s hands,
  of the way she’d always known how to fix the burn in a pot of *jjigae.* He thought
  of Mr. Kim, of the stories he’d finally let himself tell. And he thought of Mira,
  the daughter who’d carried her own grief like a weight, who’d come back not to fight
  him, but to help.


  The city’s offer was still on the table. But David had his own plan now.


  “Come on,” he said, tugging her toward the cart. “Let’s make something new.”


  Outside, Mr. Kim waited with a small cooler. He nodded as they approached. “You’ll
  need this. *Bingsu* fixings. For the street.”


  David laughed, the sound foreign but right. “You came.”


  “Of course.” Mr. Kim’s eyes were bright. “Eunice would have wanted it this way.”


  They set up by the construction site, the cart a beacon of what remained. David
  scooped shaved ice into bowls, Mira drizzled honey and sweetened milk, Mr. Kim sprinkled
  crushed *chwa* cookies. The bulldozer paused. A young family, displaced by the noise,
  wandered over.


  David handed them a spoon. “First one’s on the house.”


  Mira watched as the customers dug in, as the ice melted into something sweet and
  cold. She reached for David’s hand. He squeezed hers back.


  The cart was small. The future was uncertain. But the food was good.


  And for the first time in years, David felt like he was moving forward.'
