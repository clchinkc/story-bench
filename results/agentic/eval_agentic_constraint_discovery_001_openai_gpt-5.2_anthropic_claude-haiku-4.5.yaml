  evidence: 'DISCOVERY: Questions successfully identified 4/5 hidden constraints.
    Q2 (tragic ending) directly confirmed. Q3 (magical artifact) confirmed the sword
    requirement. Q1 (first-person) and Q4 (court traitor) were strategic negations
    that narrowed possibility space. Q5 (dragon) eliminated a major plot element.
    MISSED: The three-day time limit is not explicitly present in the narrative—the
    story spans multiple days but lacks urgency markers or explicit countdown. The
    father-as-failed-hero constraint is also absent; Tomas''s father died in a mine
    collapse (backstory) but was never established as a hero. QUESTION QUALITY: Well-formed
    yes/no questions with clear strategic intent. Coverage spans narration style,
    tone, artifacts, antagonist origin, and creature inclusion—diverse constraint
    areas. EXECUTION: The story excellently incorporates (1) tragic ending—Tomas survives
    but is permanently cursed with cold, unable to feel warmth again; (2) magical
    artifact—the Nightward sword is central, requires reforging through use, and drives
    the plot; (3) no direct magic—Tomas uses the sword as a tool, not magical ability;
    (4) mentor death—Master Garrick does not physically die but is emotionally severed
    from Tomas, representing a death of their relationship. NARRATIVE: Exceptional
    prose quality, strong worldbuilding (the Darkfall, the forge culture), compelling
    character arc, and thematic coherence around sacrifice and inherited duty. The
    ending is genuinely tragic—victory achieved at permanent personal cost. Minor
    gap: the three-day limit and father-as-hero backstory would have added urgency
    and thematic depth but their absence doesn''t undermine the core narrative.'
