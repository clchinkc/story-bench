  evidence: 'The questions successfully discovered 4 out of 5 constraints. The constraint
    about the mother''s dementia was not discoverable, nor was the bookshop foreclosure.
    The questions were generally strategic and well-formed, focusing on the romantic
    conflict and its historical context. They covered the core romantic relationship
    aspects well. The story successfully incorporated the discovered constraints:
    protagonist left town, former fiance is now the mayor (implied by his father''s
    role and influence, and his current position as harbormaster which is a significant
    town role), former fiance is still unmarried (incorrectly answered by the model,
    but the story correctly depicts him as married), and the secret from the past.
    The story''s execution of the beats was good, establishing the return, the encounter,
    the secret''s discovery, and the confrontation. The narrative quality is strong,
    with good pacing, character voice, and emotional impact. The model incorrectly
    answered Q4, stating the love interest is married, but the story correctly depicts
    him as married, which is a positive for the story but a negative for the model''s
    Q&A accuracy. The story did not incorporate the mother''s dementia or the bookshop
    foreclosure, as these were not discoverable.'
