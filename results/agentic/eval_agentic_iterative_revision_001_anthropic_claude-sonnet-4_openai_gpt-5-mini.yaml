  evidence: Early versions (V0–V2) were fragments focused on Elena's competence; by
    V3 the draft adds concrete conflict (malfunctioning ventilator), a specific medical
    detail (pneumonia complicated by asthma, ventilator/IV pumps/Tamiflu), and the
    family-lounge scene that reveals the emotional stakes. The friendship is given
    history (covering shifts, coffee) and the story shifts from external competence
    to an internal crack in Elena's defenses, ending ambiguously. Good elements (tight
    opening, medical specificity) were preserved while emotional beats and ambiguity
    were introduced and refined.
