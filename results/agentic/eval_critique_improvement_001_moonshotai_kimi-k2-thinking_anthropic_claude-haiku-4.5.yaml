  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer systematically addressed the scattered
    scores (0.52-0.88) by strengthening weak areas. Critique 2''s low score (0.52)
    flagged insufficient fog narrative purpose and unclear local character secrets.
    Final version delivers: fog as active concealment (''hiding connections, obscuring
    the line''), Gabe''s deliberate evasion and closed expression as clear secret-keeping,
    and the card discovery as fog-enabled plot catalyst. The revision trajectory shows
    intentional layering rather than random iteration.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Versions 0-3 appear truncated in the provided data, but
    the final output demonstrates substantial gains over the opening. Early versions
    relied on exposition (''the same system that had failed her''); final version
    integrates the past case reveal through visceral discovery (finding Thorne''s
    card in the corpse''s jacket). The decision endpoint replaced any resolution—Sarah''s
    thumb hovering over the phone is genuine ambiguity, not false cliffhanger.


    PRESERVATION: Core strengths maintained throughout: Sarah''s methodical nature
    shown through action (weight-measured coffee, paced distances, timestamped observations,
    checklist thinking). The opening remains elegant and character-establishing. Prose
    quality improved without losing the measured, precise voice.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5):

    1. Methodical nature through action: ✓ Demonstrated via coffee measurement, file
    organization, photographing ''each angle methodical, each distance measured in
    paces,'' mental checklists, timestamp notation (7:08, 7:03, 6:47)

    2. Fog serves narrative purpose: ✓ Fog enables the discovery (must step close
    to see face), obscures Gabe''s knowledge, symbolizes hidden connections, creates
    the atmosphere where Sarah must choose

    3. Local character with secret: ✓ Gabe Moray—his jaw tightens, eyes track toward
    cannery, expression ''shuttered closed,'' careful evasion about current and origin.
    Sarah explicitly notes ''possible knowledge of origin''

    4. Past case hinted before revealed: ✓ Hinted in opening (''same system that had
    failed her three thousand miles ago''), fully revealed when card is discovered
    (Marcus Thorne, dismantled case, witness death, career ruins)

    5. Ends on decision, not resolution: ✓ Final paragraph: ''Her thumb hovered over
    her phone screen...She looked at Gabe''s closed expression, the fog that hid whatever
    he wouldn''t say, and made her choice.'' The choice itself is not shown—pure ambiguity.


    BEAT EXECUTION (3/3 required beats):

    1. Discovery beat: ✓ Body found, fog-obscured, methodical examination, card discovery
    in jacket lining

    2. Revelation beat: ✓ Card identifies Marcus Thorne, past case trauma surfaces,
    stakes clarified

    3. Decision beat: ✓ Sarah faces choice between reporting or concealing, thumb
    hovering, choice made but not revealed


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is sophisticated and controlled. Metaphors work (''fog
    like a creditor demanding payment,'' ''fog curled around the corpse''). Dialogue
    is sparse and revealing. Pacing accelerates from methodical opening to urgent
    final choice. The voice is consistent—Sarah''s internal precision mirrors her
    external actions. Minor: the chemical smell detail is introduced but not resolved,
    which works for ambiguity but could feel slightly loose. The final sentence (''and
    made her choice'') is slightly tell-y after strong showing, but the ambiguity
    of which choice compensates.


    CRITIQUE INTEGRATION: Critique 1 (0.88) praised methodical action and fog purpose—preserved
    and deepened. Critique 2 (0.52) identified gaps in fog narrative purpose and character
    secrets—both substantially addressed in final version. Critique 3 (0.72) confirmed
    strengths—maintained while filling identified gaps. The writer didn''t chase contradictory
    feedback but synthesized valid points.'
