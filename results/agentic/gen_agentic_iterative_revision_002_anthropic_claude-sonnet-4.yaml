    - Must use non-visual sensory details prominently

    - Imani''s blindness must be portrayed respectfully and as a strength

    - Include a specific audio clue that becomes crucial

    - One character must initially underestimate Imani

    The whir of her ceiling fan mixed with the distant jackhammer symphony outside
    Imani Torres''s fourth-floor apartment. She adjusted her headphones and leaned
    into the Blue Yeti microphone, her fingers dancing across the familiar Braille
    keyboard. "Welcome back to ''Echoes in the Dark.'' I''m your host, Imani Torres,
    and today we''re diving into the Riverside Park strangler case."


    The musty smell of old radiators and fresh paint from the apartment renovation
    downstairs filled her nostrils. Gentrification had its soundtrack here in Bed-Stuy—power
    tools drowning out the old rhythms of Mr. Chen''s fruit cart and Mrs. Rodriguez''s
    salsa music.


    Her phone buzzed against the desk. A text from Detective Riley: "New development
    in the Riverside case. Can we talk?"


    Imani paused her recording. Riley had been feeding her information for months,
    always skeptical about her insights. "What kind of development?" she texted back.


    "Possible witness. But she''s... difficult. Won''t talk to anyone official."


    Twenty minutes later, Riley''s heavy footsteps echoed up the wooden stairs, followed
    by lighter, more hesitant ones. The second person reeked of cigarettes and fear-sweat.


    "Imani, this is Carmen Valdez," Riley said. "Carmen, this is the podcaster I mentioned."


    "You''re the blind girl?" Carmen''s voice carried the raspy edge of suspicion.
    "How''s someone who can''t even see gonna help catch this psycho?"


    Imani smiled, settling into her favorite interrogation mode. "Sit down, Carmen.
    Tell me what you heard that night."


    "I already told him—"


    "Tell me. Different ears, different questions."


    For the next hour, Carmen recounted her story: walking home from her cleaning
    job at 2 AM, hearing what sounded like a struggle near the park entrance, seeing
    a figure dragging something. But as Carmen talked, Imani caught something Riley
    had missed—the woman kept mentioning a sound.


    "This clicking noise," Carmen said. "Like... like someone cracking their knuckles,
    but faster. Click-click-click-click. Real rhythmic."


    Imani''s spine straightened. She''d heard that pattern before, in another case
    file. Her fingers flew across her Braille notes.


    "Carmen, was it exactly four clicks? Always four?"


    "Yeah... how''d you—"


    "Detective Riley," Imani interrupted, her heart racing. "Remember the Prospect
    Heights assault from last month? The victim mentioned a sound her attacker made.
    Four quick clicks."


    Riley''s chair creaked. "Jesus. You think—"


    "Same guy. But there''s more." Imani turned toward Carmen. "You work at the Meridian
    building, right? Night shift?"


    "How you know that?"


    "You mentioned the security guard''s radio chatter in the background when you
    called 911. Meridian''s the only building in that area with active night security.
    Which means..." Imani paused, pieces clicking into place. "You''ve been watching
    the wrong entrance, Detective. Our guy isn''t random—he''s following patterns
    based on the security rotations."


    Carmen gasped. "That cleaning supervisor, Marcus. He always asks about our schedules,
    knows when we''re walking home alone. And he does this thing with his hands when
    he''s nervous..."


    "Four clicks," Imani finished.


    Riley''s phone was already buzzing with urgent calls. As sirens began wailing
    in the distance—not background noise this time, but the sound of justice moving—Carmen''s
    voice grew small.


    "I can''t believe the blind girl figured it out when we couldn''t."


    Imani smiled grimly, saving her recording. "Sometimes you have to stop looking
    to really see."'

    downstairs filled her nostrils. Gentrification had its soundtrack here in Bed-Stuy—power
    tools drowning out the old rhythms of Mr. Chen''s fruit cart and Mrs. Rodriguez''s
    salsa music drifting through thin walls.


    Her phone buzzed against the desk. A text from Detective Riley: "New development
    in the Riverside case. Can we talk?"


    Imani paused her recording. Riley had been feeding her information for months,
    always skeptical about her insights yet unable to resist coming back. "What kind
    of development?" she texted back.


    "Possible witness. But she''s... difficult. Won''t talk to anyone official."


    Twenty minutes later, Riley''s heavy boots clogged up the wooden stairs, each
    step announcing his approach two flights down. Lighter footsteps followed—someone
    trying to stay quiet on squeaky boards. The second person reeked of cigarettes
    and fear-sweat, with an undertone of industrial bleach.


    "Imani, this is Carmen Valdez," Riley said, slightly out of breath. "Carmen, this
    is the podcaster I mentioned."


    "You''re the blind girl?" Carmen''s voice carried the raspy edge of suspicion
    mixed with disbelief. "How''s someone who can''t even see gonna help catch this
    psycho?"


    Imani grinned, settling back in her chair. She loved this part. "Sit down, Carmen.
    The chair squeaks on the left side, so take the right. Now, tell me what you heard
    that night."


    "I already told him everything—"


    "Tell me. I catch things he misses." She heard Riley''s sharp intake of breath
    at the gentle dig. "Different ears, different questions. Trust me, I''m good at
    this."


    Carmen''s story unfolded like a familiar song: walking home from her cleaning
    job at 2 AM, the sudden silence that made her skin crawl, then muffled sounds
    near the park entrance. But as Carmen talked, Imani''s fingers began tapping rhythmically
    on her desk. The woman kept circling back to something.


    "This clicking noise," Carmen said for the third time. "Like... like someone cracking
    their knuckles, but faster. Click-click-click-click. Real rhythmic, you know?"


    Imani''s spine straightened. Her exceptional audio memory kicked in—filing cabinets
    of recorded interviews suddenly accessible. "Carmen, was it exactly four clicks?
    Always four?"


    "Yeah... every few seconds. How''d you—"


    "Detective Riley," Imani interrupted, her pulse quickening. "Remember the Prospect
    Heights assault from last month? The victim mentioned her attacker made a repetitive
    sound. Four quick clicks."


    Riley''s chair creaked as he leaned forward. "Jesus. You think—"


    "Same guy." Imani''s fingers flew across her Braille notes. "But there''s more.
    Carmen, you work at the Meridian building, right? Night shift?"


    Carmen''s intake of breath was sharp. "How the hell you know that?"


    "You mentioned hearing the security guard''s radio chatter when you called 911.
    Meridian''s the only building in that area with 24-hour security patrol. Which
    means..." Imani paused, pieces clicking together like her suspect''s nervous habit.
    "You''ve been watching the wrong entrance, Detective. Our guy isn''t random—he''s
    targeting women based on information only someone with access to work schedules
    would have."


    Carmen''s voice dropped to a whisper. "That cleaning supervisor, Marcus. He''s
    always asking about our routes home, knows exactly when each girl walks alone.
    And he does this nervous thing with his hands..." Her voice trailed off in horrified
    realization.


    Outside, the afternoon construction sounds had stopped, replaced by the urgent
    wail of approaching sirens—not background noise this time, but the sound of justice
    accelerating toward its target.'

    The musty smell of old radiators and fresh paint from the apartment renovation
    downstairs filled her nostrils. Gentrification had its soundtrack here in Bed-Stuy—power
    tools drowning out the old rhythms of Mr. Chen''s fruit cart and Mrs. Rodriguez''s
    salsa music drifting through thin walls. Imani had lived here twelve years, long
    enough to track the neighborhood''s transformation through sound alone.


    Her phone buzzed against the desk. A text from Detective Riley: "New development
    in the Riverside case. Can we talk?"


    Imani groaned. She''d promised her editor a finished episode by tonight, but Riley''s
    cases always proved irresistible. "What kind of development?" she texted back,
    already knowing she''d cave.


    "Possible witness. But she''s... difficult. Won''t talk to anyone official."


    "Bring her over. I''ll make coffee." She paused, then added: "And stop somewhere
    decent. Not that gas station swill you usually drink."


    Twenty minutes later, Riley''s heavy boots clogged up the wooden stairs, each
    step announcing his approach two flights down. Lighter footsteps followed—someone
    trying to stay quiet on squeaky boards. The second person reeked of cigarettes
    and fear-sweat, with an undertone of industrial bleach.

    "You''re the blind girl?" Carmen''s voice carried the raspy edge of suspicion.
    "How''s someone who can''t even see gonna help catch this psycho?"


    Imani bit back her first three responses—all sarcastic—and forced a smile. "Sit
    down, Carmen. The chair squeaks on the left side, so take the right. Coffee?"


    "You got anything stronger?"


    "It''s 3 PM on a Tuesday, but sure." Imani retrieved a bottle of bourbon from
    her kitchen cabinet, pouring by touch. A skill that impressed exactly no one anymore.
    "Now, tell me what you heard that night."


    "I already told him everything—"


    "Indulge me. I''m curious about details cops miss." She caught Riley''s snort
    and grinned. "Different ears, different questions."


    Carmen''s story unfolded: walking home from her cleaning job at 2 AM, the sudden
    silence that made her skin crawl, then muffled sounds near the park entrance.
    Standard witness account, nothing special. But as Carmen relaxed, helped by bourbon
    and Imani''s easy manner, she began adding details.


    "This clicking noise," Carmen said. "Like... someone cracking their knuckles,
    but faster. Click-click-click-click. Real rhythmic."


    Imani paused, her bourbon halfway to her lips. Her exceptional memory—trained
    through years of audio work—kicked in. "Carmen, was it exactly four clicks? Always
    four?"


    "Yeah, every few seconds. Kinda creepy, you know? How''d you—"


    "Detective Riley," Imani interrupted, setting down her glass. "The Prospect Heights
    assault from last month. The victim mentioned her attacker made a repetitive sound.
    I have it in my case files."


    Riley''s chair creaked. "You think it''s connected?"


    "More than connected." Imani''s pulse quickened as patterns emerged. "Carmen,
    you work at the Meridian building, right? Night shift?"


    Carmen''s sharp intake told her everything. "How the hell you know that?"


    "You mentioned hearing security radio chatter during your 911 call. Meridian''s
    the only building in that area with overnight patrol. Which means..." Imani stood,
    pacing to her window where traffic hummed below. "Our guy isn''t hunting randomly.
    He''s got inside information about women''s schedules, their routes home."


    Carmen''s voice dropped to a whisper. "Jesus. That supervisor, Marcus Rodriguez.
    He''s always asking about our shifts, knows exactly when each girl walks home
    alone. And he does this nervous thing with his hands when he''s talking to us..."


    "Four clicks," Imani finished.

    The whir of her ceiling fan mixed with the staccato percussion of a pneumatic
    drill outside Imani Torres''s fourth-floor apartment. She adjusted her headphones
    and leaned into the Blue Yeti microphone, her fingertips finding the raised dots
    of her Braille keyboard. "Welcome back to ''Echoes in the Dark.'' I''m your host,
    Imani Torres, and today we''re diving into the Riverside Park strangler case."


    The sharp bite of turpentine from apartment 3B''s renovation mixed with the yeasty
    sweetness of Mr. Chen''s overripe mangoes drifting up from the street. Gentrification
    had its own signature scent here in Bed-Stuy—fresh paint over decades of cooking
    grease and cigarette smoke.


    Her phone''s vibration rattled against the wooden desk. Detective Riley: "New
    development in the Riverside case. Can we talk?"


    Imani sighed, pausing her recording. Riley brought her information but never quite
    trusted her conclusions. "What kind of development?"


    "Witness. Won''t talk to cops. Might trust you."


    "Bring her up. I''ll make coffee."


    Riley''s steel-toed boots announced his arrival from two flights down, each step
    a metronome against worn wood. Behind him, lighter footfalls tried to avoid the
    squeaky third and seventh stairs. Amateur. The accompanying scent cloud hit her
    before introductions: Marlboro Reds, nervous perspiration, and that sharp chlorine
    smell of industrial cleaning supplies.


    "Carmen Valdez," Riley wheezed. "Carmen, this is—"


    "The blind podcaster?" Carmen''s voice had the sandpaper rasp of a two-pack-a-day
    habit. "Lady, how you gonna catch a killer when you can''t even see his face?"


    Imani gestured to the chair on her right. "Left one squeaks. Coffee? Or something
    stronger since you''re shaking harder than my washing machine."


    Carmen''s laugh was bitter bark. "Bourbon, if you got it."


    This was the fun part. Imani poured by touch—a party trick that still impressed
    people—and settled into her interrogation mode. "Tell me about that night. Everything
    you heard."


    "Already told Detective Skeptical here—"


    "Tell me. I hear things differently."


    Twenty minutes in, Carmen''s story shifted from recitation to confession. The
    bourbon helped, but so did Imani''s technique of asking about sounds, not sights.
    Then Carmen mentioned it again.


    "That clicking noise. Like... rapid-fire knuckle cracking. Click-click-click-click,
    pause, repeat."


    Imani''s spine straightened. Her audio memory—fifteen thousand hours of recorded
    interviews—pulled up a match. "Four clicks exactly? Always four?"


    "Yeah. Creepy as hell. Why?"


    "Riley." Imani''s pulse hammered. "The Prospect Heights victim from March. She
    mentioned her attacker''s nervous habit."


    "Jesus, you think—"


    "Same guy. But Carmen, you work night security at Meridian, right?"


    Carmen''s sharp intake was confirmation enough. "How''d you—"


    "You mentioned radio chatter during your 911 call. Dead giveaway. Which means
    our killer isn''t hunting randomly." Imani stood, ideas crystallizing. "He''s
    got access to schedules, knows exactly when women walk home alone."


    "Shit." Carmen''s voice dropped to a whisper. "Marcus Rodriguez. The cleaning
    supervisor. Always asking about our routes, our timing. And he does this thing
    with his hands when he''s nervous..."


    "Four clicks," Imani finished.


    Outside, the construction noise had stopped. In its place, sirens wailed—not background
    ambiance this time, but justice racing toward its target.'
