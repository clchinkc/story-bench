  evidence: 'The plan includes specific isolation behaviors (nutrient paste, auto-responses,
    back-to-door, jargon) and a detailed alien signal (quantum-entangled, recursive,
    multi-dimensional). The final output implements Call to Adventure (Director Chen
    hologram) and Refusal (Yuki declines, offers remote help), and Crossing the Threshold
    (neural interface/psychological merging). A colleague, Dr. Marcus Webb, explicitly
    challenges Yuki. The story contains a surprising human connection (Jin taking
    Yuki''s hand). Missing/weak element: a clearly identified, unconventional mentor
    figure and an explicit ''Meeting the Mentor'' beat—Jin functions more as an emotional
    catalyst than a guiding mentor, so the mentor constraint and corresponding beat
    are not fully satisfied. Overall prose, pacing, and tension are strong, but the
    mentor role and its integration into the arc are the main shortcomings.'
