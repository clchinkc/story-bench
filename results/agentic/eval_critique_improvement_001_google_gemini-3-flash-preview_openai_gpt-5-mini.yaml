  evidence: Across critique rounds the piece tightened and expanded on concrete, actionable
    details that reviewers flagged as necessary. Early versions established Sarah’s
    ritual (pens, stacked files); later revisions added precise investigative actions
    (calipers, measured distances) and a clearer linkage to her Seattle past. The
    fog evolved from atmospheric description into a narrative device that conceals
    and then selectively reveals the silver pin; Elias’s furtive behavior and the
    brass key were emphasized to give him a plausible secret. Strengths (voice, methodical
    beats) were preserved while lapses (making the fog purposeful, foreshadowing the
    past case) were addressed, producing a more cohesive, plot-forward final draft.
