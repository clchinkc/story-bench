  evidence: 'PLAN STRENGTHS: Comprehensive three-act structure with clear thematic
    throughline. Specific details (negative space profiling, Pioneer Square, Dr. Slater).
    Strong character establishment and emotional stakes. PLAN WEAKNESSES: Midpoint
    confrontation not explicitly mapped; unclear how past failure confrontation occurs
    structurally. CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS: (1) FALSE LEAD - SATISFIED: Dr. Slater misdirection
    is clear and well-developed. (2) UNCONVENTIONAL PROFILING - SATISFIED: Negative
    space profiling is creative and used throughout. (3) TICKING CLOCK - SATISFIED:
    4-day timeline, accelerating to 24 hours. (4) SECONDARY BETRAYAL - PARTIALLY SATISFIED:
    Amy''s FBI report feels more protective than betrayal; lacks emotional sting of
    true trust violation. (5) MIDPOINT CONFRONTATION - UNSATISFIED: Plan mentions
    Slater confrontation but doesn''t clearly mark it as midpoint or establish it
    as non-physical debate. Output shows confrontation but lacks structural clarity.
    (6) CONFRONT PAST FAILURE - PARTIALLY SATISFIED: Nicole''s death is present but
    explicit confrontation of Marcus''s guilt/responsibility is implicit rather than
    direct. OUTPUT EXECUTION: Narrative is compelling with strong atmosphere and pacing.
    Opening effectively establishes Marcus''s trauma. False lead (Slater) works well.
    Ticking clock accelerates effectively. However, the midpoint lacks the required
    direct confrontation—Slater scene is investigative, not a true debate/confrontation
    of ideas. Amy''s betrayal reads more as well-intentioned than trust-breaking.
    Final twist (Yuri''s death, Marcus framed) is dramatic but feels rushed and somewhat
    disconnected from earlier setup. The ending suggests Marcus never truly confronted
    his past failure—he''s arrested before achieving that arc beat. BEAT ASSESSMENT:
    Catalyst (Amy''s arrival) - CLEAR. Debate (implicit resistance to investigation)
    - WEAK. Break into Two (decision to investigate) - PRESENT but unmarked. Midpoint
    (should be direct confrontation) - MISSING/WEAK. The story needs explicit midpoint
    confrontation where Marcus and another character debate the case/truth directly.'
