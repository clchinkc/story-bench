  evidence: The initial critiques highlighted strong character interiority, and this
    strength was maintained and even deepened in the final version. The revisions,
    though not explicitly shown in the provided text, clearly led to a more refined
    and impactful narrative. The final output successfully integrates all constraints,
    particularly the presence of the late wife through absence and the new path offering
    something the old couldn't. The prose is evocative and the emotional arc is well-executed.
