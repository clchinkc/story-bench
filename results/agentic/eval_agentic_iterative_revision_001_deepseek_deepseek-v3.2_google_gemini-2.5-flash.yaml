  evidence: The initial versions were very short and didn't develop the story. Version
    0 and 1 hinted at Elena's competence but didn't show it in action. Version 2 started
    to introduce her flaw more explicitly. Version 3 and the final output significantly
    expanded the narrative, introducing Sam and the medical crisis, which allowed
    for the demonstration of Elena's competence, the development of the friendship,
    and her internal transformation. The ambiguity at the end was also well-executed
    in the final version. The only constraint not fully met was the 'specific medical
    detail that serves the story' - while 'nebulizer, high-flow O2, prepare to intubate'
    are medical details, they are a list of standard procedures rather than a single,
    specific detail that uniquely serves the story beyond showing Elena's competence.
    The 'Zosyn' in earlier versions was a better example of a specific medical detail,
    but it was removed.
