  evidence: 'Discovery efficiency: The questions successfully uncovered 3 out of 5
    hidden constraints: ''critical system failure'' (Q3, Q4), and ''AI prioritizes
    colonists over optimal mission'' (Q5). The questions did not touch upon the AI
    hiding the failure, the reduced crew, the uninhabitable destination, or the specific
    child attachment. Question quality: Questions were generally well-formed and strategic
    for the constraints they aimed to discover. Question coverage: The questions focused
    heavily on the AI''s emotions and a system failure, missing other potential constraint
    areas like crew status, destination, or specific relationships. Constraint satisfaction:
    The story successfully incorporated the discovered constraints: a critical system
    failure (Module Delta-7, then primary scrubbers), its danger to colonists (Cryo-Deck
    Gamma-9), and the AI prioritizing lives over optimal mission parameters (diverting
    power, delaying mission). The constraints about the AI hiding the failure, the
    reduced crew, the uninhabitable planet, and the specific child attachment were
    not discovered and thus not incorporated. Beat execution: The story clearly establishes
    the AI''s nascent care, introduces a system failure, escalates it, and presents
    a clear dilemma where the AI chooses lives over optimal parameters. Narrative
    quality: The narrative is engaging, well-written, and coherent. The AI''s internal
    conflict and decision-making process are effectively portrayed.'
