  evidence: The initial critiques highlighted the methodical nature, fog's purpose,
    and past case hints. The final version successfully integrates all these elements
    through action and narrative. The methodical nature is shown through Sarah's coffee
    ritual, file organization, and crime scene processing. The fog serves to obscure,
    create tension, and mirror Sarah's internal conflict. The past case is hinted
    at early and then revealed as central to the plot. A local character (Gabe) clearly
    has a secret, and the ending is a strong moment of decision. The prose is engaging
    and well-paced.
