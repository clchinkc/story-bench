  evidence: The questions asked did not lead to the discovery of any of the hidden
    constraints. The questions were too generic and did not probe into the core conflicts
    or specific details that would reveal the hidden constraints. For example, asking
    if the AI has a physical avatar doesn't help uncover a hidden system failure or
    a specific attachment to a child. The output story does not incorporate any of
    the hidden constraints, as they were not discovered. The story itself is well-written
    and follows the beats, but it's not based on the intended constraints.
