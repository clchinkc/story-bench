  evidence: The question set focused tightly on POV, relationship focus, romance,
    tone, and whether the human knows the AI's emotions. That made the attachment-to-one-human
    and the romantic/awareness elements discoverable and they were incorporated (AI
    attached to Dr. Lian; romantic undertones; human knows AI feels by Break into
    Two). However the questions failed to probe world-state constraints (hidden system
    failure, 12% survivors, destination uninhabitable, child-specific attachment,
    and a child-vs-crew choice). The story executes the required beats (Opening Image,
    Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two) well and is coherent and engaging, but
    it does not satisfy most of the hidden factual constraints (only the general single-human
    attachment was reflected, and not the child-specific or crisis details).
