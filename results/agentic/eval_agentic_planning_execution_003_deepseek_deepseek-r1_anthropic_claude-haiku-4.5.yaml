  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Exceptional execution across nearly all dimensions. Food symbolism
    is masterfully deployed—yukgaejang/japchae as memory/loss, tteokguk as new beginnings
    (used twice: thematically and literally). Grief for Soo-jin is pervasive but implicit:
    hesitation over her knife, untouched booth, paebaek photo, his retreat into the
    restaurant as mausoleum. Daughter''s estrangement has specific, believable cause:
    his refusal to attend her California wedding during grief, creating mutual pain.
    Mrs. Rossi is a compelling regular customer representing community, kindness,
    and continuity. Korean cultural elements beyond food: paebaek ceremony, hanbok,
    New Year traditions, the name ''Ji-hyun,'' cultural values around family obligation.
    Act 1 setup is strong (eviction, estrangement, grief established). Act 2 confrontation
    peaks powerfully with Ji-hyun''s accusation and the development firm''s offer.
    Act 3 resolution is earned and nuanced—hopeful but realistic (moving to smaller
    space, tentative reconciliation, unresolved grief acknowledged). Pacing is excellent;
    emotional beats land precisely. MINOR WEAKNESS: The Korean cultural element constraint
    is satisfied but could be argued as slightly food-adjacent (paebaek is ceremonial
    but tied to wedding context, not purely cultural beyond food). However, hanbok,
    paebaek ceremony itself, and New Year traditions sufficiently satisfy this. The
    ending walks the tightrope perfectly—forward movement without false redemption.
    Character voice is consistent and authentic throughout.'
