  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were discoverable
    through the questions asked. Q1 (magical metalworking ability) and Q3 (forge magical
    item) directly targeted constraints 1 and 5. Q5 (time limit) discovered constraint
    3. However, Q2 and Q4 were poorly targeted—Q2 asked if darkness was sentient (answered
    NO, correctly), but didn''t probe the mentor''s death or father''s backstory.
    Q4 asked if mentor was a smith (NO), missing the critical constraint that the
    mentor MUST DIE. The father''s failed hero past was never queried. QUESTION QUALITY:
    Questions 1, 3, 5 were well-formed binary queries. Q2 was somewhat useful but
    didn''t follow up on implications. Q4 was a dead-end that didn''t pivot to explore
    mentor fate. Coverage was uneven—focused heavily on magical items/abilities, neglected
    character relationships and backstory. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION IN OUTPUT: The
    story incorporates 2/5 constraints clearly: (1) protagonist has metalworking magic
    ability ✓, (5) reforges ancestral sword (Sunsteel) ✓. Partially incorporates:
    (3) three-day time limit exists but is vague (48 hours mentioned, then 12 hours,
    timeline unclear) ~. MISSING: (2) mentor death—Master Torin survives and is never
    mentioned again after threshold crossing; this is a critical failure. (4) Father''s
    failed hero past—completely absent from narrative. BEAT EXECUTION: The Hero''s
    Journey structure is present (Call, Threshold, Ordeal, Return) but incomplete.
    The Ordeal lacks the mentor''s sacrificial death, which should be the emotional
    climax. The protagonist doesn''t face internal conflict about his father''s legacy.
    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong prose, vivid imagery, clear pacing, and satisfying magical
    system. However, the story feels incomplete thematically—it''s a competent adventure
    but lacks the emotional depth that mentor death and paternal legacy would provide.
    The victory feels earned but hollow without these character elements.'
