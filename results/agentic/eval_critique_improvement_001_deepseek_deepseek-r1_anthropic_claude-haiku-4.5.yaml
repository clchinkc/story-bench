  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: All three critiques identified strong constraint
    satisfaction (0.82-0.95 range). The revision process shows deliberate refinement
    rather than major overhauls. V0→V1 tightened prose (''choked'' vs ''pressed in''),
    introduced Baltimore hint explicitly (''No echoes of Baltimore''s failures''),
    and sharpened Eli''s characterization. V1→V2 removed the explicit Baltimore reference,
    trusting subtlety more—a sophisticated choice responding to implicit critique
    about showing vs. telling. V2→V3 added ''Between gull cries, she listened to the
    hollow quiet''—deepening methodical characterization through sensory attention.
    Final version preserves all these gains.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Measurable progression across versions: (1) Prose economy
    improved (V0''s ''measured the distance between footprints with a steel ruler,
    her gloved hands steady despite the damp chill'' became ''measured the distance
    between footprints with a steel ruler, her gloves slick with sea mist''—more visceral,
    less exposition). (2) Fog integration strengthened (V0 had atmospheric fog; V3
    fog actively disables communication and triggers trauma). (3) Character secrets
    deepened (Eli''s scratches and motor oil scent added in later versions, creating
    layered suspicion). (4) Baltimore hint evolved from explicit to implicit (''No
    echoes of Baltimore''s failures'' → kraken tattoo recognition → visceral memory
    flash). (5) Ending sharpened from ambiguous to decision-focused.


    PRESERVATION: Core strengths maintained throughout: Sarah''s methodical action
    (ruler, tweezers, photographing, noting details) never wavered. The opening hook
    remained consistent. Eli''s character arc preserved and enhanced. The fog''s dual
    function (atmosphere + plot obstacle) established early and maintained. The decision
    ending structure present from V0 onward, refined in final version.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5): (1) Methodical nature through action: ✓ Ruler measurements,
    tweezers, photographing angles, noting lividity patterns, beam catching details.
    (2) Fog serves narrative purpose: ✓ Disorientation trigger, signal blocker, memory
    catalyst, visibility collapse. (3) Local character secret: ✓ Eli''s scratches,
    motor oil scent, nervous behavior, connection to victim hinted. (4) Past case
    hinted before revealed: ✓ ''She''d chosen this muted world for its order'' → kraken
    tattoo recognition → Baltimore memory flash. (5) Decision ending: ✓ ''Call the
    state. Close the file. That''s the system.'' / ''Sarah''s finger hovered over
    the radio''s dead channel.''


    BEAT EXECUTION: Three required beats present and well-executed: (1) Investigation
    beat—methodical examination of footprints, corpse, tattoo, Eli''s scratches. (2)
    Complication beat—kraken tattoo triggers Baltimore trauma, fog blocks communication,
    Eli''s guilt becomes apparent. (3) Decision beat—Sarah must choose between procedure
    and truth-seeking, ending on suspended choice. Each beat builds logically and
    emotionally.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose demonstrates strong control. Sensory details (sea mist,
    salt crust, brine, motor oil) create immersive setting. Pacing accelerates effectively
    (methodical opening → discovery → disorientation → moral choice). Dialogue minimal
    but purposeful (''Storm''s choking the radios,'' ''Tourist... Drunk fell off a
    yacht''). Metaphors functional (fog as erasure, kraken as accusation). Final image
    (finger hovering) creates genuine tension. Minor weakness: Eli''s guilt could
    be slightly more ambiguous—current version leans toward his involvement, which
    slightly undercuts the decision''s complexity. However, this serves the narrative''s
    momentum.'
