  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: "The salt air of Whaler’s Cove had a way of preserving things, from the\
    \ weathered shingles of the seaside cottages to the lingering ache of a first\
    \ heartbreak. Elara Vance, now forty and weary of the frantic pace of her life\
    \ in Boston, stood before the teal door of \"The Salt-Stained Page.\" She had\
    \ returned to her New England roots not by choice, but by the iron-clad will of\
    \ her late Aunt Martha.\n\n**Exposition**\nThe inheritance was bittersweet. Martha\
    \ had left Elara the beloved bookstore, a labyrinth of cedar shelves and ocean\
    \ views, but it came with a daunting proviso. To finalize the deed and prevent\
    \ the property from being sold to a developer, Elara had to successfully host\
    \ the town’s 50th Annual Harvest Moon Gala, meeting a specific profit margin that\
    \ would prove the shop was still a viable cornerstone of the community. As the\
    \ autumn festival season kicked off, the town was transformed into a riot of orange\
    \ bunting, dried corn husks, and the scent of woodsmoke. Elara felt like a stranger\
    \ in her own skin, mourning her aunt while grappling with the dusty ledgers of\
    \ a business she hadn't visited in twenty years.\n\n**Rising Action**\nThe pressure\
    \ mounted as the festival began. Elara spent her mornings curating rare maritime\
    \ journals and her afternoons battling a temperamental boiler that threatened\
    \ to freeze out her customers. It was during one such struggle with a rusted pipe\
    \ that the shop’s bell chimed, and Julian Thorne walked back into her life. \n\
    \nJulian hadn't changed much; his shoulders were broader, and the lines around\
    \ his eyes were deeper, but he still carried the scent of sea spray and cedar.\
    \ He wasn't a rival bookseller or a corporate shark; he was the local shipwright\
    \ who had broken her heart when she left for college, and whom she had broken\
    \ in return. \n\n\"The pipes always did hate the cold,\" Julian said, his voice\
    \ a low, familiar rasp. \n\nThe tension between them was thick, layered with two\
    \ decades of unsaid apologies. While the inheritance condition didn't require\
    \ his help, Julian began appearing at the shop with his toolbox and hot thermoses\
    \ of cider. He fixed the sagging shelves and reinforced the window frames against\
    \ the coastal gales. As they worked in the quiet aisles, the old rhythm returned.\
    \ They spoke of Martha, of the town’s changing tides, and of the night at the\
    \ bonfire twenty years ago when they’d promised forever. Elara found herself falling\
    \ for the man he had become, even as the deadline for the Gala loomed. The town’s\
    \ gossip mill churned, and the stakes grew higher: if she failed the Gala, she\
    \ wouldn't just lose the shop; she’d lose the chance to rebuild the life she had\
    \ once discarded.\n\n**Climax**\nThe night of the Harvest Moon Gala arrived under\
    \ a sky of bruised purple and gold. The bookstore was packed, glowing with candlelight\
    \ and filled with the elite of the New England literary scene. Elara had staked\
    \ everything on a rare manuscript auction to hit Martha’s profit goal. \n\nDisaster\
    \ struck an hour in. A sudden coastal squall knocked out the town’s power, plunging\
    \ the shop into darkness. Murmurs of disappointment rose from the crowd; without\
    \ light to see the manuscripts or heat to keep the guests comfortable, the Gala\
    \ was on the verge of collapse. Elara felt the deed slipping through her fingers.\n\
    \nJust as the first guests moved toward the door, a warm, amber light flickered\
    \ in the window. Julian had hauled his industrial boat-building generators to\
    \ the alleyway, stringing heavy-duty lanterns through the rafters of the shop.\
    \ He stepped inside, soaked from the rain, and caught Elara’s eye. He didn’t say\
    \ a word, but the steady nod he gave her provided the courage she needed. \n\n\
    The darkness became an advantage. Under the intimate, golden glow of the lanterns,\
    \ the auction took on a magical, timeless quality. Elara spoke with a passion\
    \ she hadn't felt in years, weaving stories of the town’s history into every bid.\
    \ The bidding war that followed was unprecedented. When the final hammer fell\
    \ on a signed first edition of *Moby Dick*, the room erupted in applause. Elara\
    \ checked the tally; she hadn't just met the requirement—she had doubled it. \n\
    \nIn the quiet moment after the last guest departed, Elara found Julian leaning\
    \ against the pier railing outside the shop. The storm had passed, leaving the\
    \ air crisp and clean. She realized then that while the shop was finally hers,\
    \ it was the man who had helped her save it that made Whaler’s Cove feel like\
    \ home again. She stepped into the cool autumn night, ready to start the next\
    \ chapter where the previous one had ended."
