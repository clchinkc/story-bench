  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-2 are truncated identically, making revision
    assessment impossible. Version 3 (final output) is the only complete text. Without
    visible iterative changes, improvement cannot be measured. The final output shows
    PARTIAL constraint satisfaction: (1) Internal conflict is TOLD rather than SHOWN—phrases
    like ''weight of her hopes pressing down,'' ''internal struggle deepened,'' and
    ''conflict reached a boiling point'' explicitly state emotions rather than dramatizing
    them through action/dialogue. (2) Grandmother moment EXISTS but lacks crystallization
    power—the photograph scene is touching but Mateo''s choice remains abstract; we
    don''t see him making a concrete decision in response. (3) Adult understanding
    is WEAK—Abuela offers wisdom but doesn''t genuinely grapple with the dilemma''s
    complexity; she simply validates his dreams without exploring the real tension
    between family obligation and personal ambition. (4) Cultural elements are SURFACE-LEVEL—references
    to ''creosote,'' ''Arizona sun,'' ''Abuela,'' and cooking aromas feel decorative
    rather than woven into the conflict''s fabric. The sacrifice narrative is generic.
    (5) Resolution is UNEARNED—Mateo''s epiphany (''he didn''t have to choose'') arrives
    via Abuela''s encouragement rather than through his own struggle and growth. The
    final paragraph tells us he ''learned'' rather than showing transformation. BEAT
    EXECUTION: The required beats (internal conflict, grandmother moment, adult understanding,
    cultural authenticity, earned resolution) are present but underdeveloped. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Competent prose with strong sensory details, but emotional arcs rely
    on exposition. The story reads as a summary of growth rather than a dramatized
    journey. Without revision evidence, responsiveness cannot be assessed.'
