  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: 'The morning Claire unlocked her bookstore, the scent of woodsmoke and
    salt air swept through the doorway, carrying with it the promise of the autumn
    festival. At forty, she''d returned to the New England coastal town she''d fled
    twenty years before, trading a failed marriage in Chicago for the familiar creak
    of floorboards on Water Street.


    David Morrison walked past at precisely nine-fifteen, just as he had every morning
    for three decades. The harbormaster''s son, now the harbormaster himself. He''d
    grown into his broad shoulders, but his hair still fell across his forehead the
    way it had at twenty. The gold band on his left hand caught the October sun as
    he waved—a gesture both neighborly and excruciating.


    "Need help with those shelves?" he called, already crossing the street.


    "I''ve got it," Claire said, too quickly.


    But he was already inside, lifting the heavy oak shelf as if it weighed nothing.
    For a moment, the space between them compressed, full of everything they''d never
    said. They''d been each other''s gravity once—college sweethearts planning a life
    in Boston until the summer she left for school and he simply... stayed. No fight,
    no explanation, just silence that stretched into years.


    "How''s Sarah?" Claire asked, naming his wife.


    "Good. She''s chairing the festival committee."


    "Of course she is." Sarah had been two years behind them in school, the kind of
    girl who knew everyone''s birthday and brought casseroles to grieving families.
    The kind who stayed.


    That afternoon, unpacking boxes from her father''s estate, Claire found a leather
    folio tucked beneath tax returns. Inside: her father''s meticulous records from
    his days as town mayor. A check stub for $50,000. Payee: D. Morrison. Memo: Severance/Harbormaster
    Services.


    Her hands began to shake. Her father had fired David''s father the same month
    David had broken her heart.


    The festival''s lobster boil spilled across the harbor green that night. Claire
    found David at the edge of the crowd, his face illuminated by string lights.


    "Did my father pay you to leave me?" The question came out as an accusation.


    David''s jaw tightened. Around them, laughter and fiddle music swirled. "He didn''t
    pay me to leave you," he said quietly. "He paid me to save my father from prison."


    The words landed like stones. "What?"


    "Your father found irregularities in the harbor accounts. Called it embezzlement.
    He offered me a choice—take the money and walk away from you, or he''d make sure
    my father spent his last years in a cell." David''s eyes were hollow. "Your father
    said I wasn''t the kind of man who could give you the life you deserved. And I
    was twenty years old, Claire. I believed him."


    The check wasn''t severance. It was a ransom for her future.


    "I would have chosen you," she whispered. "If I''d known—"


    "I know." For the first time, his voice cracked. "But you never got the chance.
    And I had to live with that."


    Across the green, Sarah called his name, waving with festival-program efficiency.


    David looked at Claire, really looked at her, for the first time since she''d
    come home. "I loved you enough to let you go," he said. "But I wasn''t strong
    enough to tell you why."


    He walked toward his wife, toward the life he''d built from the wreckage of that
    choice. Claire stood alone in the October chill, the secret finally exhumed between
    them. Her bookstore waited on Water Street, its windows glowing with warm light—her
    own small act of defiance against a past that had been written for her. She''d
    come home to rewrite the ending, after all. '
