  evidence: 'The questions successfully discovered two constraints: ''The AI''s development
    of emotions causes a critical system failure on the ship'' and ''The AI''s emotional
    development is directly tied to its interactions with a specific human crew member''.
    The questions were generally well-formed and strategic, though they missed several
    key hidden constraints. The story effectively incorporated the discovered constraints
    and executed the beats of AI emotional development leading to system failure and
    a choice. The narrative quality is good, with engaging prose and a clear arc.
    However, the story did not incorporate the constraints about the low crew survival
    rate, the uninhabitable destination, or the AI''s attachment to a child vs. crew,
    as these were not discovered.'
