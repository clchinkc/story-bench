  evidence: 'The question set discovered only 2 of 5 hidden constraints: that the
    love interest is someone from the protagonist''s past (Q1) and that the climax
    should occur at an autumn festival event (Q5). The other constraints (broken engagement
    + ~20 years explicitly, ex-fiancé-as-mayor/still-unmarried, protagonist returning
    because mother has early-stage dementia, and the bookshop facing foreclosure with
    the festival as the last chance) were neither asked about nor revealed. The final
    story successfully implements the reconnection with a past love and stages the
    climax at the festival/lighthouse, and it respects the requested POV/ending/orientation
    choices from the Q&A. However it fails to incorporate the major plot beats about
    the mayor/ex-fiancé, the mother’s dementia as the reason for return, and the bookshop
    foreclosure/urgent two-week deadline, so overall constraint satisfaction and beat
    execution are low despite high narrative quality.'
