  evidence: 'V0 established the setting and basic tension (heat, letters) but was
    skeletal. V1 introduced the ''tools of his reputation'' and clearly flagged the
    acceptance letter, improving stakes. V2 added sensory detail (smells) and clarified
    the envelope''s placement. The final version preserves those elements and adds
    the decisive Abuela confrontation at the clinic (a clear crystallizing moment),
    empathetic adults (Tío Javi''s axle metaphor and Dr. Evans'' calm understanding),
    and a concrete, earned resolution (Mateo prepares scripts and announces his departure).
    One shortcoming: the line ''It wasn''t just guilt keeping him here; it was fear.''
    explicitly tells Mateo''s internal conflict rather than fully showing it, so the
    ''show, don''t tell'' constraint is not perfectly satisfied.'
