  evidence: The initial versions were identical and very short, only setting the scene.
    The final version significantly expanded the narrative, introducing characters,
    dialogue, and plot points that were entirely absent in the earlier versions. The
    changes from V0-V2 to V3 were minimal, focusing on word choice. The final output
    is a complete story that addresses most constraints. The primary improvement was
    the addition of content, not refinement of existing content.
