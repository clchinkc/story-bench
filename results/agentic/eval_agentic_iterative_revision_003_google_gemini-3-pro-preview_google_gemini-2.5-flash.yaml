  evidence: The initial versions were very short and only set the scene. Each subsequent
    version built upon the previous one, adding more detail, character interaction,
    and plot development. The final version successfully incorporates all constraints
    and delivers a compelling narrative. The agent clearly understood the iterative
    process and how to build a story piece by piece.
