  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer addressed key critique observations
    across revisions. Early critiques highlighted the methodical nature through action
    (pen clicking, notebook entries, systematic grid search)—this was preserved and
    deepened. The fog''s narrative purpose evolved from atmospheric to functional
    (erasing evidence, enabling concealment, creating temporal ambiguity). The final
    version strengthens this by making fog an active accomplice rather than backdrop.
    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Version 0→3 shows clear refinement. Early versions used
    exposition (''She did not step out immediately''); final version demonstrates
    through action (''She stayed in the driver''s seat long enough to make the world
    hold still''). Prose tightened: ''asphalt surrendered'' became ''asphalt gave
    way'' (more active). The file box reveal moved from passive observation to visceral
    avoidance (''didn''t let her eyes fully take in''), increasing tension. Beat execution
    improved: the discovery moment now lands with maximum impact through the wrist
    tattoo reveal and Sarah''s physical reaction. PRESERVATION: Strengths maintained
    throughout—the opening image of harbor/fog, Sarah''s methodical voice, Elias as
    the local with secrets. The core mystery structure remained intact while prose
    quality elevated. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5): (1) Methodical nature shown through
    action—extensive: pen clicks, notebook entries, boot testing, grid search pattern,
    evidence documentation. (2) Fog serves narrative purpose—confirmed: obscures distance,
    enables concealment, erases footprints, creates temporal unreliability (''fog
    made even that feel negotiable''). (3) Local character with secret—Elias: positioned
    at path top (blocking access), hands too clean, answers in ''foggy words,'' drag
    marks point toward him, final revelation (''you''re not going to like what it
    means for this town''). (4) Past case hinted before reveal—file box under seat
    (blocked from full reading), captain''s voice in memory, the HARBORLIGHT-12 tattoo
    triggering recognition. (5) Ends on decision, not resolution—final page: Sarah
    decides to reopen the case, steps toward the drag marks, demands Elias talk. No
    resolution, only commitment to investigation. BEAT EXECUTION (3/3): Discovery
    beat—methodical arrival, environmental observation, body found through systematic
    search. Recognition beat—tattoo reveal triggers memory cascade, physical reaction
    (''breath hitched hard enough to sting''), connection to sealed past. Decision
    beat—Sarah writes ''Reopen'' in notebook, confronts Elias, steps into fog toward
    evidence. Each beat lands with emotional and narrative weight. NARRATIVE QUALITY:
    Prose demonstrates strong control. Metaphors function (fog as ''accomplice,''
    distance ''knotted,'' fog ''shifted like a living thing''). Dialogue sparse but
    revealing—Elias''s hesitations and evasions communicate guilt/knowledge. Sensory
    detail grounds scene (buoy bell, kelp parentheses, wrist band). Pacing accelerates
    toward climax. The final image (stepping into fog toward drag marks) creates forward
    momentum and unresolved tension. Minor weakness: some exposition remains (''Method
    was a kind of rest'') but it''s minimal and character-appropriate. The ending
    achieves the required open-endedness while maintaining narrative momentum.'
