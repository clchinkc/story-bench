  evidence: 'VERSION 0-1: Incomplete fragments prevented full evaluation. VERSION
    2-3: Significant tightening of prose (''fingers flew'' vs ''moved with surgical
    precision''; removal of redundant ''she made sure of it''). Final output demonstrates
    strong constraint satisfaction: (1) Competence shown extensively through bed management,
    requisitions, coordination, and eight-year history with Martinez before flaw emerges.
    (2) Friendship feels earned through specific shared history (father''s death,
    Christmas Eve pile-up, covered shifts) and mutual recognition of patterns. (3)
    Transformation is internal—Elena''s physical routine unchanged (''returned to
    her desk''), but internal crack acknowledged (''hairline crack...might become
    a door''). (4) Medical detail (pneumonia complicated by asthma with specific pathology:
    ''inflammation narrowing airways while fluid drowned her lungs'') serves narrative
    by grounding Maria''s case as catalyst for Elena''s recognition. (5) Ending maintains
    ambiguity—''might, someday, become a door'' leaves genuine uncertainty about whether
    this crack will actually lead to change or remain cosmetic. Prose improved through
    revision: tighter syntax, stronger verbs, better pacing. Martinez''s question
    (''What are you running from?'') functions as turning point. The family lounge
    scene effectively contrasts Elena''s protocol-driven actions with their human
    impact. Minor weakness: Elena''s internal monologue could be slightly more resistant
    before the crack—her immediate ''I don''t know how to be anything else'' acceptance
    comes somewhat quickly, though the ''Every instinct screamed no'' partially addresses
    this.'
