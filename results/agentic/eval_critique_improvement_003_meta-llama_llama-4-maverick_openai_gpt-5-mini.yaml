  evidence: 'Early versions showed promise: vivid sensory detail of the flooded city
    and a clear instance where an adult (Jack) dismisses the protagonist as a kid.
    Critiques flagged youth-voice and unmet constraints. The revisions briefly tightened
    description (V0→V1→V2) but the final output regresses: the protagonist identity
    and tense shift (Zara → Zara/Aria), substantial irrelevant material is added,
    and key constraints are dropped or muddled. Only one constraint (real danger/
    hazardous setting) is clearly present across versions. The mentor, clear inventive
    device, sustained ''just a kid'' dismissal, and a consistently portrayed competent-but-not-perfect
    Zara are not preserved. Overall the edits respond only superficially to critique
    points and introduce new inconsistencies, so quality did not demonstrably improve
    and many original strengths were lost.'
