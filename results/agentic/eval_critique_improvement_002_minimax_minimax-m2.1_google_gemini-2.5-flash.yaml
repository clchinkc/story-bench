  evidence: The critiques highlighted the need for stronger emotional complexity and
    comedic punch in the opening. The revisions, particularly the final one, significantly
    improved these aspects. The opening joke now lands better, and the immediate deflation
    of Marcus's internal state is more impactful. The story successfully balances
    humor and pathos, and the new writer's perspective is clearly established. The
    moment Marcus almost breaks but covers it with a joke is well-executed. All constraints
    appear to be satisfied, and the overall narrative quality is strong.
