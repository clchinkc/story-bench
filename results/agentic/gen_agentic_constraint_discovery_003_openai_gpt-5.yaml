  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: 'The day Claire Whitcomb turned forty, she unlocked the dusty door of the
    Tidepool Bookshop and stepped into her childhood. The bell still jangled the same
    way it had when her mother ran the place, a slightly embarrassed sound, like it
    knew it was interrupting a reverie. Outside, the harbor of Gull’s Cove smelled
    of salt and woodsmoke. Banners for the Autumn Harbor Festival clung to lampposts,
    their orange and cranberry ribbons snapping in a brisk wind. She’d told herself
    she was back for only a season—to list the house, to settle accounts, to inventory
    the books—but the town had a way of pulling at loose threads.


    On her second morning, Claire found a carved gull on the counter she hadn’t seen
    in years. She laughed softly; her mother used to prop it by the register as a
    paperweight. Now, someone had sanded the nicks and varnished the battered beak.
    When the bell jangled again, she glanced up and almost dropped the bird.


    Noah Maddox stood in the doorway, a paper cup of cider in each hand and that same
    hesitant smile she remembered too well. He still wore his hair too long and his
    jacket too thin for a New England October.


    “Welcome home,” he said, holding out a cup like a peace offering.


    She took it. The cup was warm and his knuckles were still nicked from some honest
    work, same as when they were eighteen and arguing about colleges on the breakwater.
    She remembered the way she’d left—running toward a city, away from a boy who’d
    sworn the ocean ran in his blood. They’d chosen different tides.


    As the festival ramped up, the bookshop became a waystation for leaf-peepers and
    old church ladies, for teenagers scouring stacks of used horror paperbacks. Noah
    stopped by with crates for her display table, with flyers for the lighthouse lighting
    at week’s end. His nephew, Eli, trailed in once with sticky fingers and a pocket
    full of acorns, and Claire found herself teaching him how to press leaves between
    dictionary pages, the sort of small ritual that used to fill her mother’s afternoons.


    Rumors traveled as quickly here as gulls over a clam flat. Someone mentioned the
    boatyard Noah ran now, the way he’d taken over after his father’s stroke. Another
    said he’d almost left once, too, until life moored him. Claire felt the ache of
    old choices and new responsibilities. At night she counted receipts and mapped
    escape routes on the back of envelopes: list house, sell shop, return to Boston.
    But the town kept laying itself across her thoughts like a quilt she couldn’t
    quite fold up.


    On the morning of the harvest parade, the wind shifted colder. Claire set up a
    table of locally authored books outside, the spines glinting like fish scales—memoirs
    about storms and recipes for chowder, a dog-eared history of Gull’s Cove with
    a photo of her mother holding court near the lighthouse. When Noah walked past
    with a coil of rope slung over one shoulder, coordinating floats, he paused by
    the photograph.


    “She never missed the lighting,” he said. “Said it made the town remember who
    we were.”


    “And who we still are,” Claire said, before she could stop herself.


    The day narrowed toward evening. Strings of copper lights were strung from the
    lampposts to the bandstand, bags of sand weighted paper lanterns on the walk out
    to the lighthouse. The whole town gathered. The sea had its own applause: waves
    tapping the rocks, a steady, patient clapping. Claire felt the crowd’s bodies,
    the familiar jostle of neighbors. Somewhere behind, Eli squealed at the sight
    of a stilt walker; somewhere ahead, the high school chorus argued over the key
    for “Shenandoah.”


    Noah found her by the stairs leading up to the lantern room. “Will you come up?”
    he asked. His breath showed white, and so did hers. She followed him.


    They climbed into a glass dome of wind and light. The brass fittings gleamed from
    recent polish. From up here the town was all lanterns and moving shadows, the
    harbor stippled with reflection. Noah stood close enough that she could smell
    cider and engine grease.


    “You did what you had to,” he said, as if picking up a conversation they’d left
    mid-sentence two decades ago. “I was angry for a long time. Then I wasn’t. Then
    I was again.”


    Claire laughed, startled. “That’s honest.”


    “I want to be,” he said. “With you, I always wanted to be.”


    Down below, the mayor signaled with a flourished hand, and a hush rolled outward
    like fog. Noah’s fingers brushed hers, and something rose in her that had nothing
    to do with the cold. She thought of ledgers and lists, of her mother’s steady
    hands on the cash drawer. She thought of the city’s bright anonymity, of this
    town’s stubborn tenderness.


    The mayor’s voice carried up, ceremonial, proud. “Let there be light,” he said,
    and on that cue Noah reached for the lever. He paused, eyes on hers.


    “Is there a world,” he asked softly, “where you stay? Even part-time? Even long
    enough to see what this could be?”


    Claire didn’t know if the question was fair or if it was hope wearing good shoes.
    Outside, the wind made the flags shiver. The town seemed to hold its breath.


    She closed her fingers over his on the lever. Together, they pulled.


    The lighthouse bloomed to life, a clean arc sweeping the dark, painting the faces
    below, catching on wet rocks and sudden tears. The crowd cheered. In that surge
    of light, Claire saw Noah as the boy on the breakwater and as the man who’d learned
    to anchor.


    She looked through the glass at the road curling back into town, at her shop’s
    shadow in the windowed street. “I can stay through winter,” she said, voice hardly
    more than the hum of the bulb. “I can give it that much truth.”


    His breath caught, and he nodded, as if accepting an armistice instead of a pledge.
    The beam turned again, slow and even, sweeping, returning, like a heartbeat you
    could steer by. Outside, the first flakes of sea-snow twirled in the light and
    dissolved before reaching the ground.'
