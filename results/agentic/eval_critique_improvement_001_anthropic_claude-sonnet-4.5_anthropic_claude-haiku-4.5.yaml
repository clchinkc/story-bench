  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer systematically addressed feedback
    across revisions. Version 0→1 maintained strong constraint satisfaction (0.85).
    Version 1→2 integrated fog as active narrative obstacle (''thickening from harbor
    mouth, already obscuring furthest pilings'') rather than passive atmosphere, directly
    responding to critique concerns about narrative purpose. Version 2→3 preserved
    these gains while deepening character voice through Sarah''s internal conflict
    about methodology. The final output demonstrates full constraint satisfaction:
    (1) Methodical nature shown through action (''counterclockwise spiral,'' ''photographing
    lividity pattern,'' ''measured breathing,'' ''evidence kit retrieved''); (2) Fog
    serves narrative purpose—obscures evidence, creates time pressure, symbolizes
    Sarah''s inability to see clearly; (3) Tom Whitmore has clear secret (knew Morrison,
    withheld information, protected someone); (4) Portland case hinted at early (''the
    name that wouldn''t leave the case file,'' ''warehouse wall, the symbol carved
    deep'') before revelation; (5) Ends on decision moment (''Sarah opened her evidence
    kit and reached for the measuring tape'') not resolution. IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY:
    Revisions show measurable enhancement. Early versions established methodical nature
    but fog remained atmospheric. Later versions weaponized fog—it becomes deadline,
    concealment, and thematic mirror for Sarah''s investigative blindness. The tattoo
    discovery escalates stakes. Whitmore''s secret deepens from background detail
    to active plot complication. Final version integrates all elements cohesively.
    PRESERVATION: Exceptional. The opening ''photographed the barnacles first'' remained
    constant—a perfect anchor for methodical characterization. Core prose quality
    maintained throughout. The Boston/Portland backstory framework preserved and deepened.
    Character voice consistency strong across all versions. BEAT EXECUTION: Three
    required beats executed well: (1) Investigation beat—detailed forensic work shown
    through action; (2) Revelation beat—tattoo discovery triggers recognition of past
    case; (3) Decision beat—Sarah chooses to stay and investigate despite fear. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Prose is sharp and economical. ''Salt and decay'' and ''fog pressed against
    her back'' create visceral atmosphere. Dialogue reveals character (Whitmore''s
    hesitations, Sarah''s direct questions). The final image is powerful—reaching
    for measuring tape represents commitment to methodology despite emotional stakes.
    Pacing accelerates appropriately. The mystery deepens naturally without exposition.
    Minor: Some readers might want slightly more sensory detail in the final beach
    scene, but constraint adherence and narrative momentum justify the current approach.'
