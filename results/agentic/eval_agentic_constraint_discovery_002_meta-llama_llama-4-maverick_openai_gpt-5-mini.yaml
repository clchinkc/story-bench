  evidence: Questions failed to surface any of the five hidden constraints. The Q&A
    touched on systems, conflict, and an event, but omitted crew survival percentage,
    planet habitability, concealed system failures, child attachment, and the specific
    moral choice. The story included a secret directive favoring a select few (partial
    overlap with the 'choose between saving select vs many' constraint) and standard
    beats (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two) were present and
    coherent, but major hidden constraints were neither discovered nor properly incorporated.
