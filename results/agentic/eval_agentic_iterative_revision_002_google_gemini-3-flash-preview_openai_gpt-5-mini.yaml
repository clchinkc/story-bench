  evidence: Across versions the piece shows steady, focused improvement. V0 establishes
    a strong sensory opening and the idea of Imani's tactile mapping but is shorter
    and less specific. V1 builds texture and vibration (G train through floorboards)
    and shifts phrasing to emphasize tactile details. V2 adds concrete audio-work
    detail (adjusting gain on Scarlett interface) and begins threading an audio clue
    into the plot. V3 polishes sensory specifics (charred lamb fat, notched resistance,
    damp velvet) and tightens the beat structure. The final adds the crucial, specific
    audio clue (MedTech-7 click-whirr-chirp at ~400Hz), explicitly labels beats (Opening
    Image, Catalyst, Fun and Games, Bad Guys Close In), introduces Detective Miller
    who underestimates Imani, and converts the entertaining 'hunt' into a darker intrusion.
    Overall good elements were preserved and expanded, sensory detail increased, and
    the audio clue became central to the escalation.
