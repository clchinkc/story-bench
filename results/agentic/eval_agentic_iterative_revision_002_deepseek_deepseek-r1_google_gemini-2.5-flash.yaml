  evidence: The initial versions focused solely on refining the opening paragraph's
    sensory details. Each revision incrementally improved the vividness and specificity
    of the non-visual sensory descriptions, particularly sound. The final version
    successfully integrated all constraints and beats, building upon the strong foundation
    of sensory detail established in the earlier drafts. The progression from general
    sounds to highly specific, crucial audio clues is well-executed. The portrayal
    of Imani's blindness as a strength, the initial underestimation, the entertaining
    'fun and games' turning dark, and the prominent non-visual sensory details are
    all present and well-developed.
