  evidence: The initial versions were very short and only established Elena's competence.
    Version 3 and the final output significantly expanded the narrative to address
    the other constraints. The final output successfully introduced the flaw, developed
    the friendship, and included the medical detail. The ambiguity at the end is present,
    but the internal transformation feels a bit rushed and less deeply explored than
    it could be. The friendship feels a little forced in its rapid development, but
    the intent is there.
