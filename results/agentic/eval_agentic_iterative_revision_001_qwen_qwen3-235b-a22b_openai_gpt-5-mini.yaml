  evidence: 'Version 0 establishes Elena''s competence but is fragmentary and more
    telling than showing. Version 2 refines voice and adds concrete medical cues (lactate
    request, memorized oxygen flow rates) and sharper sentence rhythm. Version 3 trims
    repetition and tightens imagery. The final expands into a decisive scene with
    Dr. Ruiz—introducing the backup neb, suction catheter, GCS 6, CT request—and converts
    earlier telling into showing (cold coffee, deleted text, inked notes). The friendship
    is earned through collaborative crisis work (Ruiz retrieving the neb, shared coffee),
    Elena''s flaw (neglected family texts, skipped birthdays) is shown after her competence,
    her shift is internal (softening, hesitating to send the message) rather than
    external, and the ending leaves real ambiguity (she types then deletes "Thanks
    for the coffee," finger hovering). Minor issues: occasional cliché phrasing and
    a few opportunities to deepen the emotional stakes between Elena and Ruiz, which
    keeps narrative_quality from reaching the highest tier.'
