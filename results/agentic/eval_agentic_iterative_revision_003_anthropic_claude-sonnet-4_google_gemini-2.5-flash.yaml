  evidence: 'Version 0 was a barebones start. Version 1 introduced the core conflict
    and the Berkeley letter. Version 2 added more specific details about the family''s
    financial struggles and Mateo''s job, deepening the dilemma. The final version
    (Version 3) masterfully integrated all the constraints: the grandmother''s pivotal
    moment, Mrs. Patterson''s understanding, and the cultural authenticity, leading
    to a well-earned resolution. Each revision built meaningfully on the last, adding
    depth and fulfilling the prompt''s requirements.'
