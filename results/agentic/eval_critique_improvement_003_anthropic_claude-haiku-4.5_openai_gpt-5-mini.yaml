  evidence: 'Initial critiques focused on youth_voice weaknesses (scores ~0.68–0.75)
    citing occasional adult phrasing and expository lines. Across revisions the author
    doubled down on concrete, sensory detail and short, physical reactions (''Her
    stomach twisted. She wanted to throw something.''), restored and emphasized the
    adult dismissal (Marcus: ''Just a kid...''), clarified the mentor''s specific
    flaw (Kai''s trauma/risk-aversion and drinking undertone), and added an explicit
    inventive device (the rewired altimeter descent-gauge). The final version also
    strengthens the crossing with real physiological danger (pressure, nitrogen buildup,
    abort signals) rather than token obstacles. Overall the manuscript shows a clear,
    moderate improvement trajectory and preserves its strongest elements (setting
    tone, stakes, Zara''s practical ingenuity), though a few lines still lean slightly
    expository/older-voice (''That meant knowledge'') preventing a perfect score.'
