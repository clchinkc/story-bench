  evidence: 'Across revisions the piece progressed from a skeletal scene (V0) to richer,
    more specific craft details and character interactions (V1–V3). The opening joke
    and burnout motif were preserved while new minor characters (Elise, then Lena)
    and clearer craft beats (whiteboard, callback mechanics, ''hold the beat'') were
    added. Critics asked for stronger emotional complexity; the final adds an explicit
    near-break (pen slip, tear) and a visible honesty arc. However one explicit constraint
    was missed: the text shows Marcus nearly breaking but he does not cover that moment
    with a joke—he moves toward confession instead—so one required constraint remains
    unsatisfied. The Save the Cat elements (Theme Stated by a minor character, catalyst
    with Lena, emotional midpoint) are present but compressed, so beat execution is
    adequate but not fully fleshed.'
