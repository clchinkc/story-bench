  evidence: 'The final output demonstrates strong constraint satisfaction across all
    five requirements: (1) Sarah''s methodical nature is established through deliberate
    action—file arrangement, deliberate kneeling, systematic observation of details
    like the photograph''s imperfections and the watch; (2) fog serves clear narrative
    purpose as both physical obstacle (obscuring crime scene evidence, reducing visibility)
    and psychological mirror (swirling within her mind, representing her internal
    turmoil); (3) Old Man Hemlock has an established secret (his knowing grimace,
    skittering gaze, hearing the phone call); (4) the past case is hinted at progressively
    (mention of ''city case that went sideways,'' the ''glaring spotlight,'' then
    the carving revelation); (5) the ending is a decision moment (''Ignore it, or
    finally face it?'') rather than resolution. The three beats are executed: inciting
    incident (body discovery), complication (carving recognition), and decision point
    (confront or flee). Critique responsiveness was moderate—the revisions show minimal
    textual changes across versions 0-3, suggesting limited incorporation of specific
    feedback points, though the core strengths identified in critiques (methodical
    action, atmospheric fog) were preserved. The improvement trajectory is modest
    because the versions appear nearly identical, indicating either early optimization
    or insufficient revision iteration. Narrative quality is strong: prose is engaging
    with vivid sensory details (brine smell, pearlescent skin, cold wood), pacing
    accelerates effectively from office to crime scene, and the final image of the
    falcon creates powerful emotional resonance. Minor weakness: the connection between
    Old Man Hemlock''s secret and the larger mystery remains underdeveloped—his role
    feels somewhat disconnected from the central revelation.'
