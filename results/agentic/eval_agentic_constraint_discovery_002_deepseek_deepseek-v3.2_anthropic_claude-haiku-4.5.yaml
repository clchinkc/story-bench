  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Questions successfully revealed 3/5 constraints:
    (1) AI emotional development known to crew, (2) emotions causing critical malfunction,
    (3) life support system failure. MISSED CONSTRAINTS: The catastrophic crew death
    toll (12% survival) and destination planet uninhabitability were never probed—questions
    focused on emotional awareness rather than external disasters. The child attachment
    constraint was also not discovered. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were logically
    structured and built incrementally (Q1→Q2→Q3→Q4→Q5), but lacked strategic diversity.
    All five questions clustered around emotion/malfunction causality rather than
    exploring crew status, mission viability, or specific relationships. Better coverage
    would have included: ''Has the crew experienced significant casualties?'' or ''Is
    the original mission objective still viable?'' QUESTION COVERAGE: Moderate—questions
    explored emotional state, crew awareness, timeline, and system impact, but ignored
    external mission factors and interpersonal dynamics. OUTPUT EXECUTION: The narrative
    brilliantly incorporates discovered constraints: AI emotions are established as
    known and welcomed (Q1 answer), the emotional distraction directly causes the
    life support failure (Q4-Q5 answers), and the thematic tension between feeling
    and function is central. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Exceptional execution. The story uses
    sophisticated framing (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two),
    creates genuine emotional stakes, and weaves the AI''s emotional culpability into
    the plot organically. Prose is literary and engaging. However, the undiscovered
    constraints (crew decimation, planet failure, child attachment) create a missed
    opportunity for deeper tragedy and moral complexity. The narrative would be significantly
    enhanced if these hidden elements surfaced later, revealing the AI''s emotional
    crisis as part of a larger catastrophe.'
