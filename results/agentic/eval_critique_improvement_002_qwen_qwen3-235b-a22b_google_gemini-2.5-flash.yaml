  evidence: The initial submission was missing the story text, which was a critical
    oversight. The subsequent revisions successfully incorporated the story, directly
    addressing the primary critique. The story itself shows a clear improvement in
    meeting the specified constraints and beats, evolving from a basic concept to
    a well-executed narrative that balances humor and pathos effectively. Strengths
    like the initial humorous setup were preserved while weaknesses (missing content)
    were completely resolved.
