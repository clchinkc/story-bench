    CONTEXT:

    - Theory: Three-Act Structure

    - Protagonist: David Park, a 50-year-old chef who has just learned his restaurant

    of 25 years is being demolished for a highway expansion. The restaurant

    was where he met his late wife and raised his daughter.


    - Setting: A family-owned Korean restaurant in a changing neighborhood of Chicago.

    The story takes place over the final week before the demolition.


    - Conflict: David must decide whether to fight the demolition, relocate, or

    finally retire - while confronting his estranged daughter who wants

    him to move to California with her.


    - Required beats: Setup (Act 1), Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint), Resolution (Act
    3)


    CONSTRAINTS:

    - Food must be used symbolically at least twice

    - David''s grief for his wife must be present but not stated explicitly

    - The daughter''s estrangement must have a specific, believable cause

    - Include a regular customer who represents something to David

    - The ending must be hopeful but not unrealistically happy

    - Include at least one Korean cultural element beyond the food


    Create a beat-by-beat plan that:

    1. Maps out each required beat with specific events

    2. Shows how constraints will be satisfied

    3. Plans character development moments

    4. Identifies key dialogue or revelations

    \ expansion, 50-year-old chef David Park must decide whether to fight to save\
    \ what’s left, relocate, or finally retire and move to California with his estranged\
    \ daughter. As the neighborhood changes around him, he’s forced to confront not\
    \ only bureaucrats and real estate but also buried conflict with his daughter\
    \ and the unspoken grief he still carries for his late wife.\n\n**Main Characters:**\n\
    \n- **David Park (50)**  \n  - Korean-American, first immigrated in his 20s with\
    \ his wife.  \n  - Stoic, hardworking, emotionally reserved.  \n  - Owns and runs\

  content: 'Every morning for twenty-five years, David Park turned the key in the
    same stubborn lock and listened for the click that sounded like the start of a
    heartbeat.


    He stepped into the dim restaurant, flipped on the lights, and the space blinked
    awake: four booths, six square tables, the short counter with six red vinyl stools.
    The stainless-steel pass, the poster of Namsan Tower sun-faded at the corners,
    the framed photo of a young woman in a pale pink hanbok beside a much younger
    David in an ill-fitting suit.


    He didn’t look at the photo long. He never did. He went straight to the kitchen.


    Rice first. He measured with the same dented cup, rinsed it until the water ran
    almost clear, let the rhythm of the grains against the metal bowl calm him. The
    big stockpot was already on the burner, bones and aromatics clouding the air with
    seolleongtang’s milky promise. Twenty-four hours of simmering, day after day,
    the broth deepening. Quietly, steadily, like something else he refused to name.


    He moved through the prep like a prayer: scooping kimchi into tubs, lining up
    banchan in metal pans, tasting kimchi jjigae and adding just enough gochugaru.
    The radio in the corner murmured an old trot song in Korean. Without thinking,
    he hummed along, the melody tugging at somewhere just behind his ribs.


    By the time he unlocked the front door, the broth had settled into its low, contented
    boil.


    At eleven sharp, Mr. Alvarez pushed in, bell tinkling above his head.


    “You’re late,” David said, because he always said it.


    “Retirement means I can be fashionably late,” Mr. Alvarez said, hanging his Cubs
    cap on the hook by the door. “Same as always.”


    David ladled seolleongtang into a deep bowl, added a handful of green onions,
    slid over the usual spread of banchan. Mr. Alvarez ate with small, deliberate
    bites, like a man who knew how to make a good thing last.


    “They tore down that old bar on Damen,” he said between spoonfuls. “Gonna be condos.”


    David grunted.


    “One day it’ll just be this place and a bunch of coffee shops that sell plants,”
    Alvarez went on. “Then they’ll come for you.”


    “They already came,” David said, more sharply than he meant. “Certified letter
    yesterday. Highway expansion.”


    Mr. Alvarez put his spoon down. “You’re serious.”


    “End of week.” David wiped an invisible smear from the counter. “Demolition next
    Monday.”


    “You gonna fight it?” Alvarez asked.


    David thought of lawyers, city hall, forms in English dense as concrete. Thought
    of the rent hikes, the declining lunch rush, the way the neighborhood had been
    slowly forgetting him. He shrugged.


    “Maybe I retire,” he said. The word felt foreign, like trying on someone else’s
    shoes.


    Alvarez watched him. “You know, when I left teaching, I thought I’d die by the
    copier. Then, one morning, I didn’t go in. It wasn’t dying. It was…different.”


    “Different is for young people,” David said.


    “You’re not dead yet,” Alvarez replied, mild but firm. “And you got that girl
    in California, right? Mina?”


    David’s shoulders tensed. He turned away, pretending to check the simmering pot.


    “She knows?” Alvarez pressed gently.


    “She’ll hear,” David said. “I’ll call.”


    He didn’t call.


    Mina called him that night.


    “You weren’t going to tell me?” she said, voice tinny over the line.


    He sat on a crate of onions in the back, the front lights off, kitchen bathed
    in the sickly hum of fluorescence. “You’re busy,” he said. “New job, big company.”


    “Dad.” The word came out like a warning. “I had to find out from Uncle Jae in
    Busan, who saw something on Facebook. A picture of a notice on your door.”


    “I didn’t want you to worry,” he murmured.


    “Like I didn’t worry when Mom—” She cut herself off. The old drop, the step he
    always refused to take.


    He cleared his throat. “What is there to say? They tear it down. I do something
    else.”


    “You could come here,” Mina said. “We’ve talked about this.”


    “You talked,” he said. “You have your life. I have mine.”


    “That’s the problem,” she snapped. “For years, your life was this restaurant and
    pretending Mom never existed. You remember yelling at me when I said I wanted
    to move? ‘You abandon your mother twice,’ you said. Like I killed her, and then
    killed the restaurant.”


    He remembered. The way her face had closed like a slammed door.


    He heard her breath on the line, shaky. “I’m not leaving you to watch them bulldoze
    that place alone.”


    “You live three thousand miles away.”


    “I’m getting on a plane,” she said. “I’ll be there Thursday.”


    He wanted to say no. To tell her it was unnecessary, that everything was fine.
    Instead he said, “Okay,” hung up, and stared at the silent kitchen until the lights
    buzzed louder than thought.


    The days folded into one another. Word spread; old customers trickled in to say
    goodbye. A construction crew measured the sidewalk, orange vests bright against
    the gray slush of late Chicago spring.


    On Thursday afternoon, Mina walked into the restaurant with a suitcase rolling
    behind her.


    She had her mother’s eyes, but the rest of her was different now: black blazer,
    short hair, the quick, assessing gaze of someone used to solving problems on a
    screen. She stopped by the threshold, as if uncertain of some invisible border.


    “You look tired,” she said.


    “You look Californian,” he replied. It was a weak joke, but her mouth twitched,
    just a little.


    He fed her.


    He didn’t ask if she was hungry; hunger was implicit. He set a bowl of kimchi
    jjigae in front of her, the stew bubbling viciously, red and alive. He laid out
    banchan: spicy radish, spinach, jangjorim. He watched her pick up a piece of tofu,
    blow on it, take a bite.


    For years after her mother died, he’d made this stew too salty, too sour, trying
    to hit an impossible memory. Tonight, he had followed the recipe in his head to
    the letter. Mina chewed slowly, eyes brightening.


    “Tastes like Mom,” she said quietly.


    He froze, ladle hovering over the sink. It was the first time either of them had
    said her name out loud in this space in years.


    Mina looked around. “You haven’t changed anything.”


    “It worked,” he said.


    “Did it?” she asked.


    At the back of the restaurant, the small shelf with a white candle and brass bowl
    sat beneath the wedding photo. On important dates he still poured soju into the
    bowl, laid out an apple, a tangerine, a few pieces of jeon. An improvised jesa
    in a commercial kitchen. Today, the candle was cold.


    Mina’s gaze landed on it. “You still do that?” she asked.


    “On her birthday. Chuseok,” he said. “Sometimes…other days.”


    She walked over, touched the edge of the frame. Her fingers trembled; she shoved
    them into her pockets.


    “Dad,” she said. “What do you want to do?”


    He opened his mouth to give his usual answer—I have the restaurant—then realized,
    with a disorienting jolt, that in four days, he would not.


    “I could fight,” he said. “Hire lawyer. Maybe delay. Maybe move somewhere cheaper.
    Start again.”


    “You’re fifty,” she said, gently. “Do you want to start again?”


    He thought of the bone broth, of the way flavors deepened with time but also grew
    cloudy, bitter, if you never changed the water. Of Mr. Alvarez’s content retirement,
    the way the man had learned to fill his days with grandchildren and salsa classes.


    “I don’t know who I am without this place,” he admitted.


    Mina came back to the table, sat across from him. “You’re my father.”


    The word settled between them like steam.


    “You said I abandoned Mom,” she went on, voice shaking now. “So I left. And you
    stayed here with her ghost. We both ran away, just in different directions.”


    He stared at his hands. They were red from dishwater, scarred from years of knives
    and heat. “I was wrong,” he said, the words like cracking ice. “It was easier
    to be angry than…anything else.”


    She nodded, eyes wet. “I know.”


    They were quiet awhile, listening to the hum of the fridge, the faint honk of
    traffic. Outside, a gust of wind rattled the window, but inside it smelled of
    garlic and sesame oil and something softer.


    “Come with me,” Mina said. “Not forever, if you don’t want. Just…try. There’s
    this Korean community center near my place. They need someone to teach cooking
    classes. You’d yell at everyone for cutting scallions wrong, but they’d love you.”


    “I don’t speak good enough English to teach,” he protested, out of habit more
    than conviction.


    “You taught me,” she said. “In two languages.”


    He pictured a classroom instead of a line, students instead of customers. No midnight
    closings, no leaking sinks. Just recipes and stories, maybe a rice cooker humming
    in a fluorescent-lit room somewhere in Los Angeles.


    “And the restaurant?” he asked.


    Mina looked around the room, at the scuffed floors, the patched vinyl, the memories
    embedded like grease in the walls.


    “Let’s give it a proper goodbye,” she said. “One last dinner. For whoever wants
    to come. Then we let it go.”


    On Sunday night, every table was full. Old neighbors, former dishwashers, kids
    who’d grown up on his galbi and now brought their own toddlers. Mr. Alvarez sat
    at his usual stool, raising a bottle of soju in salute.


    “Salud, David,” he said. “To chapter two.”


    “Chapter three,” David corrected, surprising himself. “At least.”


    He cooked like a man choreographing a farewell, sending out extra banchan, slipping
    free plates of hotteok to crying children. The kitchen was stifling, sweat dripping
    down his back, but his movements were light, a little reckless. When a line cook
    accidentally burned a batch of jeon, David laughed and flipped them himself, mumbling,
    “Ai, shibal,” without heat.


    At the end of the night, when the last table scraped their chairs back and the
    final check was tucked into the register, Mina stood beside him at the door. Together,
    they bowed slightly to the empty room, a small, private act of respect.


    In the morning, the demolition crew arrived.


    They watched from across the street, paper cups of convenience-store coffee cooling
    in their hands. The excavator’s arm swung toward the facade, glass shattering
    under metal teeth. The sign—PARK’S KOREAN CUISINE—splintered and fell.


    Beside him, Mina slipped her hand into his. He didn’t let go.


    Dust rose, gray against the gray sky. Under it, David caught the faintest echo
    of cooked rice, of broth, of sizzling meat. Not ghosts, he realized, just memories—portable,
    after all.


    When the building crumpled, something inside his chest did too, but not entirely
    in a way that hurt. There was room now, in the rubble, for something else to grow.


    “So,” Mina said softly. “LA?”


    He thought of sun instead of slush, of unfamiliar freeways, of a community center
    kitchen with fluorescent lights as harsh as any he’d known. He thought of standing
    in front of a room, saying, “First, wash the rice until the water runs almost
    clear,” and of a roomful of strangers repeating the motion he’d made every morning
    for twenty-five years.


    “Let’s see,” he said. “We can try.”


    She squeezed his hand. Behind them, traffic flowed past the empty lot, already
    adjusting to the new space in the city’s body. Ahead of them, the week suddenly
    seemed wider than seven days.


    “Appa,” Mina said, the Korean word small and steady.


    He turned to her, really turned, as if she’d just walked into his restaurant for
    the first time. “Let’s find some good soup,” he said. “Then we talk about flights.”


    They walked away from the dust and noise, toward a future he couldn’t yet picture,
    only smell in hints: garlic, green onion, steam rising from a bowl he hadn’t made
    yet but might, somewhere else, for people who didn’t yet know his name.'

  “You’re not dead yet,” Alvarez replied, mild but firm. “And you got that girl in
  California, right? Mina?”


  David’s shoulders tensed. He turned away, pretending to check the simmering pot.


  “She knows?” Alvarez pressed gently.


  “She’ll hear,” David said. “I’ll call.”


  He didn’t call.


  Mina called him that night.


  “You weren’t going to tell me?” she said, voice tinny over the line.


  He sat on a crate of onions in the back, the front lights off, kitchen bathed in
  the sickly hum of fluorescence. “You’re busy,” he said. “New job, big company.”


  “Dad.” The word came out like a warning. “I had to find out from Uncle Jae in Busan,
  who saw something on Facebook. A picture of a notice on your door.”


  “I didn’t want you to worry,” he murmured.


  “Like I didn’t worry when Mom—” She cut herself off. The old drop, the step he always
  refused to take.


  He cleared his throat. “What is there to say? They tear it down. I do something
  else.”


  “You could come here,” Mina said. “We’ve talked about this.”


  “You talked,” he said. “You have your life. I have mine.”


  “That’s the problem,” she snapped. “For years, your life was this restaurant and
  pretending Mom never existed. You remember yelling at me when I said I wanted to
  move? ‘You abandon your mother twice,’ you said. Like I killed her, and then killed
  the restaurant.”


  He remembered. The way her face had closed like a slammed door.


  He heard her breath on the line, shaky. “I’m not leaving you to watch them bulldoze
  that place alone.”


  “You live three thousand miles away.”


  “I’m getting on a plane,” she said. “I’ll be there Thursday.”


  He wanted to say no. To tell her it was unnecessary, that everything was fine. Instead
  he said, “Okay,” hung up, and stared at the silent kitchen until the lights buzzed
  louder than thought.


  The days folded into one another. Word spread; old customers trickled in to say
  goodbye. A construction crew measured the sidewalk, orange vests bright against
  the gray slush of late Chicago spring.


  On Thursday afternoon, Mina walked into the restaurant with a suitcase rolling behind
  her.


  She had her mother’s eyes, but the rest of her was different now: black blazer,
  short hair, the quick, assessing gaze of someone used to solving problems on a screen.
  She stopped by the threshold, as if uncertain of some invisible border.


  “You look tired,” she said.


  “You look Californian,” he replied. It was a weak joke, but her mouth twitched,
  just a little.


  He fed her.


  He didn’t ask if she was hungry; hunger was implicit. He set a bowl of kimchi jjigae
  in front of her, the stew bubbling viciously, red and alive. He laid out banchan:
  spicy radish, spinach, jangjorim. He watched her pick up a piece of tofu, blow on
  it, take a bite.


  For years after her mother died, he’d made this stew too salty, too sour, trying
  to hit an impossible memory. Tonight, he had followed the recipe in his head to
  the letter. Mina chewed slowly, eyes brightening.


  “Tastes like Mom,” she said quietly.


  He froze, ladle hovering over the sink. It was the first time either of them had
  said her name out loud in this space in years.


  Mina looked around. “You haven’t changed anything.”


  “It worked,” he said.


  “Did it?” she asked.


  At the back of the restaurant, the small shelf with a white candle and brass bowl
  sat beneath the wedding photo. On important dates he still poured soju into the
  bowl, laid out an apple, a tangerine, a few pieces of jeon. An improvised jesa in
  a commercial kitchen. Today, the candle was cold.


  Mina’s gaze landed on it. “You still do that?” she asked.


  “On her birthday. Chuseok,” he said. “Sometimes…other days.”


  She walked over, touched the edge of the frame. Her fingers trembled; she shoved
  them into her pockets.


  “Dad,” she said. “What do you want to do?”


  He opened his mouth to give his usual answer—I have the restaurant—then realized,
  with a disorienting jolt, that in four days, he would not.


  “I could fight,” he said. “Hire lawyer. Maybe delay. Maybe move somewhere cheaper.
  Start again.”


  “You’re fifty,” she said, gently. “Do you want to start again?”


  He thought of the bone broth, of the way flavors deepened with time but also grew
  cloudy, bitter, if you never changed the water. Of Mr. Alvarez’s content retirement,
  the way the man had learned to fill his days with grandchildren and salsa classes.


  “I don’t know who I am without this place,” he admitted.


  Mina came back to the table, sat across from him. “You’re my father.”


  The word settled between them like steam.


  “You said I abandoned Mom,” she went on, voice shaking now. “So I left. And you
  stayed here with her ghost. We both ran away, just in different directions.”


  He stared at his hands. They were red from dishwater, scarred from years of knives
  and heat. “I was wrong,” he said, the words like cracking ice. “It was easier to
  be angry than…anything else.”


  She nodded, eyes wet. “I know.”


  They were quiet awhile, listening to the hum of the fridge, the faint honk of traffic.
  Outside, a gust of wind rattled the window, but inside it smelled of garlic and
  sesame oil and something softer.


  “Come with me,” Mina said. “Not forever, if you don’t want. Just…try. There’s this
  Korean community center near my place. They need someone to teach cooking classes.
  You’d yell at everyone for cutting scallions wrong, but they’d love you.”


  “I don’t speak good enough English to teach,” he protested, out of habit more than
  conviction.


  “You taught me,” she said. “In two languages.”


  He pictured a classroom instead of a line, students instead of customers. No midnight
  closings, no leaking sinks. Just recipes and stories, maybe a rice cooker humming
  in a fluorescent-lit room somewhere in Los Angeles.


  “And the restaurant?” he asked.


  Mina looked around the room, at the scuffed floors, the patched vinyl, the memories
  embedded like grease in the walls.


  “Let’s give it a proper goodbye,” she said. “One last dinner. For whoever wants
  to come. Then we let it go.”


  On Sunday night, every table was full. Old neighbors, former dishwashers, kids who’d
  grown up on his galbi and now brought their own toddlers. Mr. Alvarez sat at his
  usual stool, raising a bottle of soju in salute.


  “Salud, David,” he said. “To chapter two.”


  “Chapter three,” David corrected, surprising himself. “At least.”


  He cooked like a man choreographing a farewell, sending out extra banchan, slipping
  free plates of hotteok to crying children. The kitchen was stifling, sweat dripping
  down his back, but his movements were light, a little reckless. When a line cook
  accidentally burned a batch of jeon, David laughed and flipped them himself, mumbling,
  “Ai, shibal,” without heat.


  At the end of the night, when the last table scraped their chairs back and the final
  check was tucked into the register, Mina stood beside him at the door. Together,
  they bowed slightly to the empty room, a small, private act of respect.


  In the morning, the demolition crew arrived.


  They watched from across the street, paper cups of convenience-store coffee cooling
  in their hands. The excavator’s arm swung toward the facade, glass shattering under
  metal teeth. The sign—PARK’S KOREAN CUISINE—splintered and fell.


  Beside him, Mina slipped her hand into his. He didn’t let go.


  Dust rose, gray against the gray sky. Under it, David caught the faintest echo of
  cooked rice, of broth, of sizzling meat. Not ghosts, he realized, just memories—portable,
  after all.


  When the building crumpled, something inside his chest did too, but not entirely
  in a way that hurt. There was room now, in the rubble, for something else to grow.


  “So,” Mina said softly. “LA?”


  He thought of sun instead of slush, of unfamiliar freeways, of a community center
  kitchen with fluorescent lights as harsh as any he’d known. He thought of standing
  in front of a room, saying, “First, wash the rice until the water runs almost clear,”
  and of a roomful of strangers repeating the motion he’d made every morning for twenty-five
  years.


  “Let’s see,” he said. “We can try.”


  She squeezed his hand. Behind them, traffic flowed past the empty lot, already adjusting
  to the new space in the city’s body. Ahead of them, the week suddenly seemed wider
  than seven days.


  “Appa,” Mina said, the Korean word small and steady.


  He turned to her, really turned, as if she’d just walked into his restaurant for
  the first time. “Let’s find some good soup,” he said. “Then we talk about flights.”


  They walked away from the dust and noise, toward a future he couldn’t yet picture,
  only smell in hints: garlic, green onion, steam rising from a bowl he hadn’t made
  yet but might, somewhere else, for people who didn’t yet know his name.'
