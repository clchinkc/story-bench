  evidence: The revisions show a clear effort to incorporate feedback, particularly
    regarding Zara's voice and the mentor's flaw. The initial versions were a bit
    generic, but the final version successfully integrates the 'puzzle of broken things'
    and the mentor's specific grief. Strengths like the vivid worldbuilding were maintained
    throughout. The final output clearly satisfies all constraints.
