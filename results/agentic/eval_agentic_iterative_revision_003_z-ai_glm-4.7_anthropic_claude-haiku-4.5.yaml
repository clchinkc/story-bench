  evidence: 'VERSION 0→1: Minimal changes; both versions tell rather than show conflict
    through exposition (''the permanent knot of tension''). VERSION 1→2: Critical
    pivot—introduces rent increase subplot, complicating stakes beyond personal ambition
    to family survival. This shifts from abstract choice to concrete pressure. VERSION
    2→3: Identical setup, suggesting stabilization. FINAL OUTPUT: Executes all constraints
    effectively. CONSTRAINT 1 (Internal conflict shown, not told): Achieved through
    physical manifestations—tight grip on rag, guilt holding pencil, throat tight
    with glass-like words. The pea-shelling scene shows internal struggle through
    action/dialogue rather than narration. CONSTRAINT 2 (Grandmother moment crystallizes
    choice): Abuela''s pea-in-palm gesture and ''I crossed the river so you could
    have choices'' is the precise crystallizing moment. It reframes his sacrifice
    as betrayal of her sacrifice. This is earned and specific. CONSTRAINT 3 (Adult
    understands dilemma): Tío Raul serves this role—he reads the situation, validates
    Mateo''s need, and acts as bridge between mother''s disappointment and son''s
    growth. His quiet support (''Déjalo. He''s right. The boy is drowning'') demonstrates
    genuine understanding. CONSTRAINT 4 (Authentic cultural elements): Spanish dialogue
    integrated naturally (''Tus cejas están juntas,'' ''Vámonos,'' ''déjalo''). Panadería
    setting, family obligation culture, translator role, and immigration backstory
    (''I crossed the river'') feel embedded, not performative. No exoticization. CONSTRAINT
    5 (Earned resolution): Mateo''s choice costs him—mother''s disappointment is real,
    not resolved. His voice ''shaking but gaining volume'' shows internal struggle
    preceding action. The final image (walking toward bus stop, ''just Mateo'') demonstrates
    growth through earned sacrifice, not convenient epiphany. TRAJECTORY QUALITY:
    V0→Final shows meaningful deepening. Early versions relied on telling (''permanent
    knot,'' ''converting fear to hope''). Final version trusts readers to infer through
    scene. The rent increase subplot (V2 onward) adds realistic pressure that makes
    choice harder and more meaningful. Pea-shelling scene is the major addition that
    transforms the piece from competent to strong. PRESERVATION: Core elements maintained
    (setting, family business, medical appointment, workshop opportunity) while removing
    weak exposition and adding visceral detail. The opening line survives all versions—strong
    anchor. MINOR GAPS: Resolution feels slightly abrupt post-decision; could benefit
    from one more beat showing Mateo''s internal state at workshop. Mother''s arc
    remains unresolved (realistic but potentially unsatisfying). These are minor given
    constraint satisfaction.'
