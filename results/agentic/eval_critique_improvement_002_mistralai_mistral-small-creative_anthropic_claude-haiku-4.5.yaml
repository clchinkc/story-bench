  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.72): The revisions show selective engagement
    with feedback. Critiques highlighted emotional_complexity scores (0.72-0.75),
    emphasizing the need for deeper pathos beneath humor. V3 adds the ''Moment of
    Truth'' scene where Marcus nearly breaks (''For the first time in years, he didn''t
    have a punchline''), directly addressing the ''almost breaks but covers'' constraint.
    However, revisions don''t substantially deepen the emotional complexity—the coffee
    shop joke remains the primary laugh mechanism, and the sadness reveal still feels
    somewhat abrupt. The writer preserved the strong opening but didn''t amplify the
    emotional stakes that critiques flagged.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.68): V0→V1→V2→V3 shows modest gains. The most significant
    change is V2→V3 (burnt popcorn vs. stale coffee—sensory specificity), and the
    addition of the ''Moment of Truth'' scene. However, the trajectory plateaus: the
    core structure remains identical across versions, suggesting limited iterative
    deepening. The ''Fun and Games'' section (V3) adds collaborative energy but doesn''t
    resolve the emotional_complexity gap flagged in critiques. The ending feels rushed—''And
    for the first time in years, he believed it'' is tell, not show.


    PRESERVATION (0.75): Strengths are maintained: the opening image remains vivid,
    the coffee shop joke lands consistently, Lila''s theme statement (''It''s about
    surviving being funny'') is preserved and effective, and the writers'' room authenticity
    holds. The ''You''re the only one here who''s choosing to stay that way'' confrontation
    is sharp. However, the preservation comes at the cost of risk-taking—the writer
    didn''t experiment with structure or tone shifts that might have addressed emotional
    depth concerns.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.82, 4/5 satisfied):

    ✓ Laugh before sadness: Coffee shop joke (''I want my latte to taste like my divorce
    papers'') succeeds—readers laugh before the ''spark in the dark'' fades.

    ✓ Theme by minor character: Lila delivers it cleanly (''It''s about surviving
    being funny'').

    ✓ Comedy craft specificity: The rewrite session shows technique (forced chuckle
    → silence → punchline), and the ''worse than the joke'' callback demonstrates
    structural thinking.

    ✓ New writer sees through Marcus: Jess''s ''You''re choosing to stay that way''
    and ''I was afraid of ending up like you'' prove perception.

    ✗ WEAK: Almost breaks but covers with joke. The ''For the first time in years,
    he didn''t have a punchline'' moment shows the break, but there''s NO JOKE COVER.
    Marcus goes silent instead. This violates the constraint''s requirement for a
    joke to mask the vulnerability. The constraint asks for a moment where he ''almost
    breaks but covers it with a joke''—the text shows him breaking without covering.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.78): Save the Cat beats are present but unevenly weighted:

    - Opening Image: Strong (writers'' room, desperation)

    - Theme Stated: Effective (Lila''s line)

    - Catalyst: Solid (Jess''s rewrite challenge)

    - Fun and Games: Adequate (rewrite session, but brief)

    - Midpoint: Present but underdeveloped (Jess''s departure feels abrupt; emotional
    stakes unclear)

    - Climax: Functional (pitch meeting) but lacks tension—the exec''s response is
    vague

    - Resolution: Rushed (one-line ending)


    The structure exists but lacks escalation. The midpoint should be a false victory
    or major setback; instead, Jess just leaves, and Marcus sits alone. This deflates
    momentum.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.76): The story is competent and emotionally resonant in moments.
    Strengths: the coffee shop joke is genuinely funny, the Jess-Marcus dynamic has
    friction, and the writers'' room feels lived-in. Weaknesses: the ending is tell-not-show
    (''he believed it''), the climax lacks stakes (will the network greenlight it?
    We never learn), and the emotional arc compresses in the final act. The dialogue
    is sharp but sometimes on-the-nose (''You''re choosing to stay that way'' is direct
    rather than subtext-driven). The story works as a character study but underdelivers
    as a three-act narrative.


    KEY REVISION GAPS: Critiques identified emotional_complexity as the primary weakness
    (0.72-0.75 range). The final version adds one vulnerability scene but doesn''t
    systematically deepen Marcus''s interiority or show his transformation through
    action rather than declaration. The ''almost breaks but covers'' constraint remains
    unsatisfied—a critical miss given its specificity.'
