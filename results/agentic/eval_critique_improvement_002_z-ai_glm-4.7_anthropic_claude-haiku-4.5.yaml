  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer systematically addressed emotional_complexity
    feedback across revisions. Critique 1 (0.72) identified pathos clarity but weak
    humor integration. Critique 2 (0.85) praised the space heater bit landing with
    genuine humor. Critique 3 (0.92) confirmed both humor and pathos working together.
    Final output demonstrates this feedback loop: the space heater joke now lands
    harder (''Two pairs. One for him, one for the daughter'') before the pathos reveal
    (''He hadn''t felt a genuine spark of joy in three years''). The writer also added
    Dave''s early presence to establish the writers'' room authenticity that critiques
    implicitly required.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Version 0 opened with immediate joke delivery but lacked
    internal depth. Version 1 added pacing and physical comedy craft. Version 2 introduced
    Marcus''s internal state (''jagged handwriting,'' ''stale coffee and desperation'')
    and the almost-break moment. Version 3 (final) synthesized all improvements: Dave''s
    opening establishes industry authenticity, the space heater bit executes with
    specific detail, Jerry''s thematic statement arrives organically from a minor
    character, Marcus''s near-collapse is visceral (''throat tightened,'' ''gripped
    the marker until knuckles turned white''), and Maya''s entrance provides the non-naive
    observer who sees through him completely.


    PRESERVATION: The space heater joke remained intact across all versions, proving
    the core comedy worked. The ''one for him, one for the daughter'' line—praised
    in Critique 2—was preserved and strengthened. The emotional architecture (static/white
    noise metaphor) from Critique 1 was retained and deepened. The writers'' room
    authenticity (hoodies, bare feet, budget cuts) persisted and expanded.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5):

    1. ''Make us laugh before we realize he''s sad'': ✓ Space heater bit lands with
    genuine laughter (''The room erupted'') before Marcus''s internal monologue reveals
    his three-year emotional void.

    2. ''Theme stated by minor character, not Marcus'': ✓ Jerry articulates the theme
    (''a joke only lands if there''s a little bit of truth underneath it'') while
    Marcus remains silent, then Dave/Maya reinforce it.

    3. ''Show craft of comedy writing with specific detail'': ✓ The escalation logic
    (''Escalate it. What''s the button?''), the visual button (power strips overload),
    the prop specificity (two pairs of slippers), and the ''on the nose'' critique
    all demonstrate professional comedy architecture.

    4. ''New writer sees through Marcus'': ✓ Maya''s entrance is the story''s turning
    point. She reads his face (''scanned his face, reading the lines of exhaustion''),
    identifies his fraud (''You look like a guy who''s forgotten how to cry''), and
    strips him bare with the Variety interview callback.

    5. ''Marcus almost breaks but covers with a joke'': ✓ The near-collapse is visceral
    and specific (''throat tightened,'' ''hot, sharp pressure,'' ''gripped the marker
    until knuckles turned white''), then the mask snaps back (''Well, Jerry, if I
    write any more truth, I''ll need a therapy co-writer credit'').


    BEAT EXECUTION: Save the Cat structure is implicit but solid. Inciting Incident:
    Maya arrives. Rising Action: Her observation of Marcus''s exhaustion. Midpoint:
    She reveals she read his work and it saved her. Climax: She names his condition
    (''You look like a guy who''s forgotten how to cry''). The structure serves character
    revelation rather than plot, which is appropriate for a character study.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY: The final output achieves professional-level execution. Sensory
    details (marker squeak, stale coffee, warped notebook cover) ground the scene.
    Dialogue reveals character and conflict simultaneously. The Marcus-Jerry-Maya
    triangle creates dramatic tension. The ending leaves Marcus ''exposed'' and ''seen''—a
    vulnerable, earned moment that justifies the entire piece. The writing demonstrates
    understanding of comedy craft (escalation, buttons, visual comedy) while maintaining
    emotional authenticity.'
