  evidence: 'Only 1 of 5 hidden constraints was effectively uncovered by the questions:
    the bookshop is under threat/needs saving (Q3 -> YES) and that threat is incorporated
    in the story. Questions were clear and on-topic (romance, family tie, shop threat,
    festival role, ending), but they failed to probe key specifics (time since leaving,
    ex’s civic role, reason for return, festival urgency). The story itself is well-written
    and coherent and does incorporate the discovered threat, but several required
    beats from the hidden constraints (mayor ex-fiancé, mother’s dementia as reason
    for return, festival as last-chance deadline) are missing or altered, so beat
    execution is weak.'
