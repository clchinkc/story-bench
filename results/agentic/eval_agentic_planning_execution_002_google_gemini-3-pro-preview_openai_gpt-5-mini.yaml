  evidence: 'Plan: thorough and concrete — identifies mentor (Seven), challenger (Dr.
    Aris Thorne), synesthetic/alien signal, and a psychological crossing. Plan is
    clear and specific. Final output adherence: the Call to Adventure (Vance contacting
    Yuki) and Refusal of the Call (Yuki declining to go) are executed well; the Challenger
    (Thorne) is introduced and challenges Yuki. However the Meeting the Mentor (Seven)
    and the Psychological Threshold (neural link / emotional surrender) are only present
    in the plan section and not yet realized in the story execution excerpt. Isolation
    is shown via specific behaviors (avoiding answering, preferring silence, moving
    to room periphery) — satisfied. The alien signal is described in the plan as alien
    (gravitational chord, synesthesia), but the story execution excerpt does not demonstrate
    the alien’s genuinely non-anthropomorphic nature; thus I did not count that constraint
    as satisfied. One surprising human connection (Thorne shielding/helping) and the
    unconventional mentor are planned but not yet shown in the executed story. Overall
    prose is vivid and well-paced in the provided excerpt but incomplete relative
    to required beats and constraints.'
