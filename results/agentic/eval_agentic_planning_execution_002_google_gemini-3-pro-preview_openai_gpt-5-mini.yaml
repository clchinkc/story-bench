  evidence: 'Plan: Clearly maps each required beat and includes concrete scene ideas
    (apartment avoidance behaviors, Vance and the signal, Icebox/Tower, rival Thorne,
    Elias the janitor, Neural Bridge). Final output adherence: The story follows the
    plan closely—Yuki''s isolation is shown by behaviors (dismissing a mother call,
    waiting for the drone, holding breath, noise-canceling headphones). The colleague
    who challenges her is Dr. Aris Thorne. The mentor is an unconventional janitor/maintenance
    tech, Elias. The Threshold is psychological (Yuki lowering her walls via the Neural
    Bridge). A surprising human connection occurs when Maya silently places noise-cancelling
    headphones on Yuki. The single failing/partial constraint: the alien signal is
    rendered vividly alien in texture, but the ending frames it as a recognizable
    question (''Is anyone else out there?'') and as a hive-mind yearning—this introduces
    anthropomorphic meaning and slightly undermines the requirement that the signal
    feel genuinely non-anthropomorphic. Overall pacing, tension, and emotional payoff
    are strong.'
