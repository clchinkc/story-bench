  evidence: 'Satisfied constraints: ticking clock (Krane''s missing daughter / risk
    of next victim) and Marcus confronting past failure (multiple explicit references
    to Sophie and his failed case). Missing/unsatisfied constraints: no clear false
    lead that Marcus initially pursues is resolved as false (black roses are introduced
    but not shown to be a deliberate false lead); no unconventional profiling technique
    is shown or described; no secondary character betrayal occurs in the excerpt;
    the required Midpoint direct (non-physical) confrontation is not present. Beats:
    Catalyst (Lena''s call about the Night Stalker) — present; Debate (Marcus wrestling
    with guilt, visiting grave, talking with Mac) — present; Break into Two (Marcus
    commits to finding Aria/Krane''s daughter) — present; Midpoint — absent. The plan
    itself is fairly concrete and matched the opening scenes, but key required elements
    were omitted in the delivered output.'
