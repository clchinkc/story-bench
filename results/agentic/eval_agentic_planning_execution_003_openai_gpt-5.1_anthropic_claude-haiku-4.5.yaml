  evidence: 'PLAN: Exceptionally detailed blueprint with clear character arcs, beat-by-beat
    structure, and explicit constraint mapping. Specificity is high (named characters,
    concrete conflict origins, symbolic food uses pre-identified). Minor gap: plan
    doesn''t fully detail the jesa ritual execution, though it''s mentioned. ADHERENCE:
    Output follows plan closely with strong fidelity to character voices, pacing,
    and major plot points. Small deviation: plan suggests more explicit lawyer/city
    hall resistance; output moves faster to acceptance. CONSTRAINTS: (1) Food symbolism—kimchi
    jjigae as mother''s memory + seolleongtang as grief metaphor (twice used); (2)
    David''s grief—present throughout via averted gaze at photo, cold candle, unspoken
    loss, finally named in confrontation; (3) Estrangement cause—specific and believable:
    David''s post-death emotional unavailability + accusation of abandonment when
    Mina pursued own path; (4) Regular customer—Mr. Alvarez represents life beyond
    work, gentle wisdom, acceptance of change; (5) Hopeful but realistic ending—David
    tries LA, teaching instead of ownership, no guarantee of success, but genuine
    reconciliation and forward movement; (6) Korean cultural element—jesa ritual (ancestral
    offering), hanbok photo, trot music, Korean language use, community center context.
    BEATS: Act 1 setup (restaurant closure notice, David''s isolation, Mina''s estrangement)
    executed cleanly. Act 2 confrontation (phone call, Mina''s arrival, naming of
    mother, admission of wrong) is emotionally earned and specific. Act 3 resolution
    (goodbye dinner, demolition, departure toward LA) balances closure with openness.
    NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is lyrical without excess. Sensory details (rice rinsing,
    broth smell, dust) ground emotion. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext.
    Pacing accelerates appropriately through acts. Tension curves from external (demolition
    deadline) to internal (father-daughter rupture) to existential (identity beyond
    restaurant). Ending avoids both cynicism and false uplift—''Let''s see'' and ''we
    can try'' capture genuine uncertainty with hope. Minor weakness: Mr. Alvarez could
    have slightly more presence in final act, though his absence at the goodbye dinner
    is thematically defensible (David''s story, not his).'
