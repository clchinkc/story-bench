  evidence: 'PLAN ASSESSMENT: The plan is well-structured with clear beat-by-beat
    outline addressing setup, confrontation, and resolution. However, the plan is
    incomplete—it cuts off mid-description of Beat 1.2 and never details Acts 2 and
    3, leaving confrontation and resolution unplanned. Specificity is good for Act
    1 but lacking for later acts. CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS: (1) Food symbolic use—SATISFIED:
    Kimchi/banchan preparation as defiance and heritage link (explicit). (2) Grief
    implicit—SATISFIED: Photo of Hana, the void she left, emotional subtext without
    direct statement. (3) Daughter estrangement with cause—SATISFIED: Mia missed graduation,
    David chose restaurant over her, argument about moving on. Specific and believable.
    (4) Regular customer—SATISFIED: Mr. Henderson represents old neighborhood/community
    loyalty. (5) Hopeful but realistic ending—NOT SATISFIED: Output ends mid-conflict
    with no resolution shown. Cannot evaluate if ending meets this constraint. (6)
    Korean cultural element beyond food—NOT SATISFIED: Only food (kimchi, banchan,
    barley tea) and the restaurant name appear. Missing elements like *jeong*, *han*,
    Confucian family dynamics, or other cultural markers beyond cuisine. OUTPUT EXECUTION:
    Act 1 (Setup) is well-executed with strong atmospheric detail, character introduction,
    and inciting incident. The phone call with Mia establishes the core conflict.
    However, Acts 2 and 3 are completely absent—no confrontation scene and no resolution.
    The narrative cuts off at the beginning of the conflict. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong
    prose with sensory detail, emotional subtext, and character voice. Pacing is deliberate
    and contemplative. Tension builds through the phone call. However, the incomplete
    structure (missing 2/3 of required beats) significantly undermines overall effectiveness.
    The output reads as a prologue rather than a complete story.'
