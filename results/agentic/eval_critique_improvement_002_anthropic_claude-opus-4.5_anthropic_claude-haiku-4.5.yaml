  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The writer systematically addressed emotional
    complexity feedback across revisions. Critiques 1-3 all scored emotional_complexity
    at 0.80-0.85, identifying the machine/heat metaphor as effective. The final output
    preserves this core strength while deepening the pathos through Priya''s direct
    confrontation. The ''hairline crack'' moment and Marcus''s inability to complete
    the joke show responsiveness to feedback about balancing humor with genuine vulnerability.
    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Version 0→3 shows clear progression. Early versions established
    the writers'' room authenticity and Marcus''s deflection patterns. Later revisions
    intensified Priya''s perceptiveness—she moves from observant to actively confrontational,
    directly naming Marcus''s defense mechanisms (''three deflections in thirty seconds'').
    The final beat where Marcus cannot write the joke represents a structural breakthrough:
    the story ends not with a punchline but with the possibility of authenticity.
    This is a sophisticated response to the constraint requiring Marcus to ''almost
    break but cover with a joke''—the final version subverts this by having him fail
    to cover, which is more powerful. PRESERVATION: All three critiques praised the
    opening metaphor (''surgeon studying X-ray of something terminal''), the pad thai
    detail, and the Jenny grandmother moment. These remain intact and unweakened.
    The ''rule of three'' callback to therapy is new but doesn''t displace existing
    strengths—it amplifies them by connecting comedy structure to depression structure.
    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Marcus makes us laugh before sadness emerges—YES
    (''Very 2008. Very nostalgic'' / Macarena bit lands, then Jenny''s grandmother
    line shifts tone). (2) Theme stated by minor character—YES (Jenny: ''A man who
    makes everyone laugh but himself is just a very talented liar''). (3) Comedy craft
    specificity—YES (rule of three explained, callback structure, deflection patterns,
    the machine/heat metaphor). (4) New writer sees through Marcus—YES (Priya identifies
    the ''Funeral Caterer'' connection to his father''s death, names his deflections,
    refuses to laugh at his jokes). (5) Marcus almost breaks but covers—YES (the moment
    after ''That episode aired right after your father died''—his hand stops, something
    pushes up through his chest, then he deflects with ''HR would be impressed'').
    BEAT EXECUTION: Inciting Incident (Priya arrives with knowledge)—strong. Rising
    Action (escalating confrontation, each of Priya''s observations more direct)—well-paced.
    Midpoint (Jenny''s grandmother line)—effective thematic statement. Climax (Priya
    names his deflections; Marcus cannot write the joke)—powerful. Resolution (Marcus
    asks for help instead of joking)—earned and non-sentimental. NARRATIVE QUALITY:
    The prose maintains specificity throughout (''fluorescent lights hummed,'' ''something
    that felt dangerously like hope flickered once, then steadied''). The dialogue
    feels authentic to writers'' rooms. The final line—''Okay. Tell me what you''d
    do instead''—is a genuine character turn, not a false epiphany. The story respects
    both comedy and pain without resolving the tension between them. WEAKNESSES: The
    ''insurance lapsed'' joke lands somewhat flat (intentionally, but risks feeling
    forced). The therapist reference could be seen as slightly on-the-nose, though
    it''s justified by the rule-of-three structure. These are minor—the story earns
    its emotional stakes through specificity and refuses easy catharsis.'
