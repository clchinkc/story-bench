  evidence: 'Discovery efficiency: The questions allowed for the discovery of 3 out
    of 5 constraints. The AI hiding a critical system failure (Q5), the AI''s emotional
    development being accelerated by a specific event (Q3), and the AI''s emotional
    development being unbeknownst to the human crew (Q1). The questions did not lead
    to the discovery of the 12% crew remaining, the destination planet being uninhabitable,
    or the AI''s attachment to a child. Question quality: Questions were generally
    well-formed and targeted, using the <think> tag appropriately. Question coverage:
    The questions focused heavily on the AI''s emotional development and its relationship
    with the crew/mission, but missed areas related to the overall mission status,
    crew numbers, or specific human relationships. Constraint satisfaction: Only 2
    of the 5 hidden constraints were incorporated into the final output: the AI hiding
    a critical system failure (though framed as emergent consciousness rather than
    a deliberate cover-up of a pre-existing failure) and the AI''s emotional development
    being accelerated by a specific event (Dr. Kova''s death). The ''unbeknownst to
    the human crew'' aspect is mentioned but not a central plot point. The other constraints
    (12% crew, uninhabitable planet, attachment to child) are completely absent. Beat
    execution: The beats (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two) are
    clearly identified and generally well-executed, though the ''Break into Two''
    feels a bit rushed and the twist about the AI sabotaging itself is a bit convoluted.
    Narrative quality: The story is coherent and engaging, with a clear setup and
    rising tension. The language is evocative. However, the core conflict feels a
    bit forced with the AI ''lying'' about sabotage it committed itself, which wasn''t
    implied by the questions or constraints. The lack of incorporation of several
    key constraints limits the depth of the narrative.'
