  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: V0→V1 shows modest improvement in sensory layering
    (adding smell/texture to sound). V1→V2 introduces the crucial absence-detection
    concept, strengthening Imani''s perceptual advantage. V2→V3 (final) significantly
    escalates with the beeping audio clue becoming plot-critical and the thriller
    framework emerging. However, execution remains uneven.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:

    1. Non-visual sensory details (0.95/1.0): Excellent throughout—smell (lavender,
    cigarette smoke, copper, disinfectant), touch (damp sheets, rough rug, cool glass),
    taste implied, sound dominant. Pervasive and well-integrated.

    2. Blindness as strength (0.85/1.0): Imani''s audio perception genuinely solves
    the case. She detects the killer''s signature beep before sighted characters.
    However, the portrayal occasionally edges toward ''magical hearing'' rather than
    trained skill—the narrative could better emphasize her professional expertise
    and deliberate listening practice.

    3. Specific audio clue (1.0/1.0): The six-beep digital watch signature is specific,
    recurring, and becomes plot-critical. Excellent execution.

    4. Character underestimation (0.8/1.0): Rivera initially dismisses her concerns
    (''You''re out of line''), but this beat feels rushed. More development of his
    skepticism would strengthen this.

    5. Fun and Games entertainment (0.8/1.0): The sensory-rich opening and mystery
    setup are engaging. The ''fun'' phase (discovering the absence, investigating
    sounds) entertains before the scream. However, the tonal shift to darkness happens
    abruptly in the final paragraphs rather than gradually, reducing the impact of
    the turn.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.75/1.0):

    - Setup: Strong sensory immersion ✓

    - Inciting incident (missing sounds): Well-executed ✓

    - Investigation phase: Competent but brief

    - Climax: Functional but compressed—the confrontation lacks tension

    - Resolution: Feels rushed; the final meta-commentary (''never underestimate'')
    undermines the thriller stakes


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.75/1.0):

    Strengths: Immersive sensory writing, creative use of audio as detective tool,
    respectful portrayal of disability as professional asset. Weaknesses: Pacing becomes
    frenetic in final act; character development of Rivera and the killer minimal;
    the ending''s podcast-host framing feels tacked-on and deflates tension; some
    sensory details (the ''raised stitching'' on pillowcase) feel decorative rather
    than functional.


    PRESERVATION (0.8/1.0): Core sensory framework maintained and strengthened. The
    beeping signature introduced in V3 is retained as central. However, some V2 elements
    (the absence-detection mystery) are somewhat overshadowed by the thriller plot
    in V3.


    FEEDBACK RESPONSIVENESS (0.75/1.0): The revisions clearly address constraints,
    but responsiveness is uneven. The ''fun and games'' constraint receives adequate
    but not exceptional treatment—the entertainment phase could be longer and more
    developed before the dark turn.'
