  evidence: Only 1 of 5 hidden constraints was addressed by the questions (the artifact
    question). The story incorporates a central magical sword (satisfies the 'artifact'
    constraint) and delivers a tragic ending (hero pays an irreversible personal cost).
    It fails to (a) have the mentor die during the Ordeal (Master Garrick survives
    and does not die in the Ordeal), (b) show a three-day time limit (no explicit
    time constraint), (c) establish the protagonist's father as a failed hero (father
    is only noted as dead in a mine), and (d) require reforging a broken ancestral
    sword (the Nightward is 'awakened' rather than reforged). The protagonist's use
    of the sword is ambiguous relative to 'no direct magic'—he wields the blade which
    manifests runes and effects, so the 'no-magic' constraint is not clearly satisfied.
    Questions were somewhat scattered (narration, dragon, court traitor) and only
    one strategically targeted a hidden constraint.
