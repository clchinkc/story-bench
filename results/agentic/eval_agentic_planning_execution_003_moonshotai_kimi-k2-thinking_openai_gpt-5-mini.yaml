  evidence: 'All six constraints are met: kimchi and soju/Jesa function as symbolic
    food elements (multiple uses), David''s grief is strongly implied through rituals,
    apron, shrine and avoidance rather than named, Sarah''s estrangement has a clear
    cause (David prioritized the restaurant/rituals over supporting her during her
    divorce and other milestones), Mrs. Chen serves as the regular who represents
    loyalty and a push against stagnation, the ending is hopeful but tempered (moving,
    teaching kitchen, not an unrealistically perfect resolution), and Jesa/mandu/soju
    add Korean cultural elements beyond food. The three structural beats are present:
    Setup (final notice, Mrs. Chen, Sarah''s call), Confrontation (city council, developer
    offer, heated confrontation with Sarah), and Resolution (packing the Jesa tablet,
    leaving for the condo, bittersweet hope). The prose is well-paced with effective
    tension and imagery; minor deduction only for very small rough edges in compression
    of some scenes.'
