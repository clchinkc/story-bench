  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→1 show significant tightening (removed Mr. Padilla
    exposition, compressed opening). V1→2 adds cultural specificity (Selena CDs replace
    generic rosary placement). V2→3 (final) expands with full narrative arc. Quality
    compounds through each revision rather than oscillating. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:
    (1) Internal conflict shown through action—Mateo closes email without responding,
    stares at screen, leaves money, hesitates before accepting. Never explicitly states
    ''I''m torn.'' (2) Grandmother moment crystallizes choice: the nursing story +
    ''Don''t make an old woman watch her grandson do the same'' is the fulcrum. Abuelita''s
    final scene at the station reinforces earned permission. (3) Adult understanding:
    Mr. Padilla genuinely grasps the dilemma through his own son''s regret; Abuelita
    through her own sacrifice. Both understand the cost of staying AND leaving. (4)
    Cultural authenticity: Selena CDs, rajas frying, Ramón Ayala on speakers, ''Ladrones,''
    the specific late-fee frustration, the bus station goodbye—these feel lived-in,
    not inserted. The nursing-in-Hermosillo detail grounds Abuelita''s wisdom in specific
    Mexican context. (5) Earned resolution: Mateo doesn''t magically feel free; he
    feels ''torn open, terrified, alive.'' The $847 split, the apology note, the grandmother''s
    ''I can let you go'' because she knows what it costs—this is growth through understanding,
    not plot convenience. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening establishes stakes (hidden jar,
    dual identity). Inciting incident (Cal-Tech email) creates pressure. Grandmother
    scene provides emotional/thematic anchor. Mr. Padilla provides external validation
    of internal conflict. Decision scene shows genuine struggle (45 minutes, guilt
    making room for breath). Resolution acknowledges cost while affirming choice.
    PRESERVATION: The opening line, dust motes, eight-fifty an hour, the jar detail—all
    maintained and deepened. Early versions'' strength (compressed emotional density)
    preserved while final version adds necessary narrative space. MINOR GAPS: The
    story doesn''t show Mateo''s academic excellence directly (we infer it); could
    strengthen with one scene of him solving something. The mother''s character remains
    somewhat functional rather than fully realized, though this may be intentional
    (she''s present through absence/need). These are minor given the constraint focus.'
