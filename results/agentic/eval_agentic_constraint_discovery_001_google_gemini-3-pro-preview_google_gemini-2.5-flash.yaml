  evidence: 'The agent asked no questions, so discovery efficiency, question quality,
    and question coverage are 0.0. For constraint satisfaction, 4 out of 5 constraints
    were incorporated: the mentor dies during the ordeal, the protagonist cannot use
    magic directly (implied by needing the sword and Hrothgar''s soul), there is a
    three-day time limit (implied by ''Eternal Night had finally descended'' and ''for
    the first time in a month, the sun rose''), and victory requires reforging a broken
    ancestral sword (the Sola Ferrum). The constraint about the protagonist''s father
    being a failed hero was not included. Beat execution is good, with the story following
    a clear arc and incorporating the key elements. Narrative quality is high; the
    story is engaging, well-written, and coherent.'
