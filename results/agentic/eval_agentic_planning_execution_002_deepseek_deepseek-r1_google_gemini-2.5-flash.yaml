  evidence: 'The plan is comprehensive, addressing all constraints and beats with
    specific details. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan. All constraints
    are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through specific behaviors (ignored notifications,
    nutrient paste, flinching at laughter, ''comforting silence''), the alien signal
    feels genuinely alien (fractal helix, no symmetry, vast, ancient, profoundly other),
    Thorne challenges Yuki''s approach (''context'', ''why they''re signalling''),
    Crowe is an unconventional mentor (''soul'', ''feel it, don''t just dissect it'',
    bizarre instruments), the Threshold is psychological (''conscious, terrifying
    choice to embrace the very thing she feared''), and the moment of human connection
    with Thorne is surprising and well-executed. All beats are present and well-developed.
    The narrative quality is high, with good pacing and tension.'
