  evidence: 'Only one constraint was discoverable: ''Is any hidden constraint about
    including a specific supporting character type (such as a childhood friend or
    single parent)?'' The answer was YES, and the story includes a childhood friend
    (Jamie) and a single parent (Jamie). However, the story completely missed the
    core hidden constraints about the protagonist''s past broken engagement, the former
    fiance being the mayor, the mother''s dementia, and the bookshop facing foreclosure.
    The story instead invents a new plot about Evelyn returning to open a pop-up in
    a vacant storefront and deciding whether to stay, which contradicts the foreclosure
    constraint. The questions were generally well-formed and covered different areas,
    but the model''s answers to them were not always accurate in revealing the actual
    hidden constraints. For example, the model answered NO to ''Is any hidden constraint
    related to a specific plot event or twist that must occur?'' when the foreclosure
    and saving the shop via the festival are significant plot events. The narrative
    quality is good, but it fails to incorporate the critical hidden constraints.'
