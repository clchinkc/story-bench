  evidence: The initial critiques highlighted the successful implementation of several
    constraints, particularly Sarah's methodical nature and the fog's narrative purpose.
    The revisions, though not explicitly detailed in the provided trajectory, clearly
    built upon these strengths. The final output demonstrates a strong adherence to
    all constraints. Sarah's methodical nature is shown through actions like arranging
    bottles, folding towels, counting lampposts, and photographing the scene. The
    fog serves a clear narrative purpose by disorienting, obscuring evidence, and
    isolating characters. Walsh's secret is hinted at through his aborted gesture
    and knowledge of Brennan. Sarah's past case (Brennan trafficking) is hinted at
    and then revealed. The ending is a clear moment of decision, not resolution. The
    beats are well-executed, and the narrative quality is high, with engaging prose
    and effective pacing.
