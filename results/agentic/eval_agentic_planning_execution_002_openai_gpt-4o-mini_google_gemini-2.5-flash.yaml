  evidence: 'The plan is mostly complete and specific, though the mentor''s unconventionality
    could have been more detailed. The final output adheres well to the plan. Most
    constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through behavior (avoiding calls,
    preferring text, bristling at collaboration), the mentor is unconventional (artist
    turned cognitive scientist, colorful scarf), the colleague challenges Yuki (Samuel
    Reyes), and there''s a moment of human connection (sharing childhood memory with
    Samuel). The Threshold is psychological (overcoming fear of vulnerability to present
    findings). However, the alien signal doesn''t feel genuinely alien; it''s described
    as ''stark warnings about humanity''s self-destructive tendencies,'' which is
    anthropomorphic. All beats are executed. The narrative quality is good, with decent
    pacing and character development, though the alien signal constraint is a notable
    miss.'
