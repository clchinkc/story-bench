  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→1→2→3 show consistent refinement. V0 was incomplete
    (truncated). V1 added sensory specificity (''swish-scrape,'' ''soupy heat'').
    V2 elevated metaphor (''damp silk,'' ''devouring''). V3 crystallized precision
    (specific street names, ''thump-groan-thump,'' exact FM frequency). Final output
    maintains all gains while adding narrative depth and character dynamics. Quality
    arc is clear and purposeful.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5):

    1. NON-VISUAL SENSORY DETAILS (PROMINENT): Exceptional execution. Tactile (''damp
    washcloth,'' ''cool metal ridge,'' ''smooth cold edge''), auditory (piledrivers,
    broom scrapes, sirens, WQXR frequency, elevator whine, ''scritch-scritch-scritch''),
    olfactory (Swisher Sweets, Valvoline, wet earth, geraniums, cigar smoke). Sensory
    details drive plot, not decorate it.

    2. BLINDNESS AS STRENGTH: Masterfully portrayed. Imani''s audio pattern recognition
    solves the case. Her ''familiar map'' of braille, her podcast format, her ability
    to isolate the ''scritch-scritch-scritch'' from noise—all demonstrate capability,
    not limitation. No pity narrative present.

    3. SPECIFIC AUDIO CLUE (CRUCIAL): The ''scritch-scritch-scritch''—worn sneaker
    tread on concrete—becomes the breakthrough that identifies the suspect. Listener
    submission, isolated by Imani, cross-referenced with her memory of the lobby gait.
    This is the lynchpin of the investigation.

    4. CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION: Detective Miller''s condescension is palpable (''given
    your situation,'' ''brusque,'' ''veneer of politeness over bedrock condescension'').
    His sharp inhale when Imani details her findings signals his recalibration. This
    arc is earned and subtle.

    5. FUN AND GAMES (ENTERTAINING BEFORE DARK): The podcast investigation is genuinely
    engaging—listener participation, witty commentary (''Gentrification''s got a soundtrack''),
    real-time mystery-solving, Ben''s observations. Engagement soars. Then the tone
    shifts: 2:17 AM footsteps, smoke invasion, Miller''s warning about arson and worse.
    The pivot is sharp and effective.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.92):

    - Inciting incident (Mrs. Henderson''s silence): Clear, sensory-driven, establishes
    Imani''s perceptiveness.

    - Detective arrival: Establishes underestimation and condescension.

    - Investigation phase: Methodical, entertaining, audience-engaged.

    - Breakthrough: Logical, earned through Imani''s unique sensory strengths.

    - Dark turn: Abrupt, threatening, raises stakes convincingly.

    Minor gap: The final threat feels slightly rushed; could benefit from one more
    sensory detail of immediate danger (e.g., a specific sound at the door).


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.9):

    Strengths: Immersive sensory world-building, authentic Brooklyn voice, Imani''s
    agency and competence, thematic coherence (sound as investigation tool), pacing
    that builds tension. The metaphor of ''daily score'' and ''frequency'' unifies
    the narrative. Dialogue feels natural. The final image (''scraping relentlessly
    closer in the dark'') is haunting.

    Weaknesses: Mrs. Henderson remains somewhat abstract (we never hear her voice
    or learn her fate). The ''Brooklyn Heights Renewal'' conspiracy is introduced
    late and could use more grounding. Ben''s character is functional but underdeveloped.


    FEEDBACK RESPONSIVENESS (0.9):

    The revision trajectory shows clear attention to constraint requirements. Each
    version tightened sensory language, added specificity (street names, FM frequency,
    shoe size), and deepened Imani''s characterization. The final output integrates
    all feedback points seamlessly. Only minor: could have expanded the ''Fun and
    Games'' beat slightly for more entertainment value before the dark turn.'
