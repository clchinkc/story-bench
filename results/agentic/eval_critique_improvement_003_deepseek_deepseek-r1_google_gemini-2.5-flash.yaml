  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on the 'youth_voice' criterion, providing
    specific examples of strengths. The revisions (though not explicitly shown as
    changing the text in the provided versions 0-3, implying the final output is the
    result of the *last* revision) successfully maintained and even enhanced these
    elements. The final output demonstrates a strong youth voice, and all constraints
    are clearly met. The narrative flows well and the beats are distinct.
