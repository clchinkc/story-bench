  evidence: The quality improved significantly across versions. Version 0 was a very
    basic start, focusing only on initial sensory details. Version 1 expanded on these,
    adding more specific sounds and smells, but still lacked plot. Version 2 introduced
    the 'absence' and the crucial 'drip-drip-drip' clue, starting to build tension.
    Version 3 refined the opening, making it more engaging and immediately establishing
    Imani's heightened senses and the unusual silence. The final output successfully
    integrated all constraints, building a compelling narrative around Imani's blindness
    as a strength, the specific audio clue (the watch beep), and the initial underestimation
    by Rivera. The 'Fun and Games' aspect was subtly handled by the initial 'symphony'
    of the city being disrupted, which then turns dark. The non-visual sensory details
    are prominent throughout.
