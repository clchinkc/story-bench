  evidence: 'The plan is very complete and specific, outlining characters, conflicts,
    and a clear arc. The final output adheres almost perfectly to the plan. All constraints
    are met: food is symbolic (kimchi, dumplings, ginger), David''s grief is shown
    through actions (setting three chopsticks, failed dumplings, not opening boxes),
    the daughter''s estrangement cause is specific and believable (mother''s promise,
    David''s choice), Mr. Choi is a regular customer representing memory/grief, the
    ending is hopeful but not unrealistically happy (restaurant gone, but family reunited
    and traditions continue), and Korean cultural elements (kimchi, jjigae, jeon,
    barley tea, specific food preparation) are present. The beats are clearly executed:
    Setup (restaurant routine, demolition news), Confrontation (Grace''s arrival,
    tape recorder revelation), Resolution (reconciliation, acceptance of loss, looking
    forward). The narrative quality is high, with good pacing, emotional depth, and
    strong character development.'
