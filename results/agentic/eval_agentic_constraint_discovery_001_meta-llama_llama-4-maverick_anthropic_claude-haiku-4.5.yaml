  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Only 1 of 5 constraints was discoverable through
    the questions asked. Q2 confirmed the protagonist is female (satisfying ''blacksmith''s
    apprentice is not male''), but the other 4 constraints remained completely hidden.
    The questions failed to probe: mentor death, magic prohibition, time limit urgency,
    father''s heroic past, or ancestral sword reforging. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions
    were poorly strategic. They asked binary yes/no about setting and connections
    but never targeted the core narrative mechanics (time pressure, mentor fate, magic
    system, family legacy, artifact importance). No questions explored supernatural
    mechanics beyond one vague ask. QUESTION COVERAGE: Moderate coverage of character/setting
    but zero coverage of plot mechanics, magical systems, time constraints, or family
    backstory. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Output incorporates almost none of the hidden
    constraints. The story features: bandits (not supernatural darkness), no time
    limit mentioned, no ancestral sword, no father subplot, no mentor death, and no
    magic prohibition (though protagonist doesn''t use magic anyway). Only the female
    protagonist and capital setting align with discovered information. BEAT EXECUTION:
    Standard hero''s journey beats present (Call, Threshold, Ordeal, Return) but lacks
    the specific narrative weight these constraints would provide. The Ordeal is generic
    combat rather than a transformative trial involving mentor sacrifice. NARRATIVE
    QUALITY: Story is competent and engaging with good prose, character voice, and
    pacing. However, it reads as a generic fantasy tale rather than a constrained
    narrative. The emotional stakes feel muted without the mentor''s death, time pressure,
    or family legacy driving urgency.'
