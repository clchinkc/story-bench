  evidence: 'PLAN ANALYSIS: The outline addresses Setup and Catalyst clearly but lacks
    detail on Debate, Break into Two, and Midpoint beats. The plan mentions these
    required beats exist but provides minimal specificity on how they''ll unfold.
    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) False lead - NOT PRESENT in plan or output; (2) Unconventional
    profiling - PARTIALLY addressed (umbrella spoke analysis hints at it, but not
    explicitly unconventional); (3) Ticking clock - SATISFIED (killer''s return, multiple
    victims implied); (4) Secondary character betrayal - NOT PRESENT (Izzy is supportive,
    no betrayal setup); (5) Midpoint confrontation - NOT PRESENT (plan mentions it
    exists but output ends before reaching it); (6) Confront past failure - PARTIALLY
    SATISFIED (David Miller''s death referenced, guilt established, but not a direct
    confrontation scene). BEAT EXECUTION: Catalyst is well-executed with strong specificity
    and emotional weight. Setup is adequately established. Debate beat is completely
    absent from output. Break into Two is not reached. Midpoint is not reached. OUTPUT
    QUALITY: The prose is strong with vivid imagery (rain metaphor, atmospheric Seattle
    setting), compelling character voice, and effective tension-building. Marcus''s
    emotional state is well-rendered. However, the output only covers ~15% of the
    story and stops before delivering on promised structural beats. The opening is
    exceptional but incomplete relative to requirements.'
