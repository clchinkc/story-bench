  evidence: The critiques primarily focused on 'youth_voice'. While the initial versions
    had some adult-sounding phrases, the final version significantly improved Zara's
    dialogue and internal monologue to sound more authentically 12. Phrases like 'Her
    stomach twisted. She wanted to throw something.' and her direct, practical observations
    ('She heard information') were highlighted as strong in critiques and maintained/enhanced.
    The 'weak' points identified in critiques (e.g., 'They moved through the submerged
    Sh...') were either removed or rephrased to better fit a younger perspective.
    The core strengths of the narrative (worldbuilding, ingenuity) were preserved
    throughout the revisions.
