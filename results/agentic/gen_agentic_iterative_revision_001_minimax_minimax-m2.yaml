  content: 'Elena Vasquez knew the rhythm of the hospital better than her own heartbeat.
    During flu season, she moved through the corridors like a tide, smoothing the
    ER’s intake bottleneck, rerouting patient flow from overflowing wards, and adjusting
    staffing to the hourly spikes that never failed to arrive. Her spreadsheets were
    precise, her emails crisp. Nurses trusted her to make the right call, and the
    board trusted her to make it look effortless. When the fluorescent lights hummed
    their constant tune, Elena felt useful, indispensable, safe.


    On the third night of a ten-day surge, a code blue rattled the ICU. Elena stood
    outside the glass, watching the team work, watching the monitor spike and dip.
    A nurse—Marta—caught her eye and nodded. They didn’t know each other well, but
    Elena had approved extra staffing for Marta’s unit twice in a week. The patient
    stabilized, oxygen saturations rising from a worrying 88 percent to a steadier
    94. Elena returned to her office, her hands already reaching for the next email.


    It was after midnight when she realized she hadn’t eaten. The vending machine
    was empty except for stale crackers and a bruised banana. She stared at the glass,
    seeing the reflection of a woman who had built her life around being needed. When
    Marta appeared with two steaming cups of broth, Elena felt a sudden, unexpected
    sting in her chest.


    “From the cafeteria,” Marta said. “They’re closing soon. Thought you could use
    it.”


    Elena accepted the cup, the heat grounding her. They sat on the bench near the
    waiting area, the room buzzing with soft alarms and distant voices. Marta spoke
    about her son, about the way flu season always made her think of him. Elena found
    herself talking about the hospital’s budget, the way she’d learned to make numbers
    do what the budget never could. The words felt like a performance she’d rehearsed
    alone.


    “You ever take a break?” Marta asked, not unkindly.


    Elena’s first instinct was to list the reasons she couldn’t. The ward needed her.
    The board needed her. The numbers needed her. She watched Marta sip broth and
    felt the familiar tug of competence, the comfort of being the person who solved
    things. But something in Marta’s presence made the solution feel incomplete.


    The next night, Elena stayed late again, and again Marta brought broth. They didn’t
    talk about budgets or staffing. They talked about the way fluorescent light changed
    the color of skin, the way machines hummed like lullabies. Elena began to hear
    her own loneliness in the sound.


    On the seventh night, the ER filled beyond capacity. Elena stood in the doorway,
    spreadsheets in her head, ready to pivot resources. Marta’s voice cut through
    the noise, gentle and firm, asking for a moment of Elena’s time. They sat together,
    and Elena let herself be held by a silence that wasn’t solved by numbers. She
    didn’t offer solutions. She didn’t offer more staffing. She offered, for the first
    time in years, the possibility that she wasn’t the only one who could keep the
    hospital breathing.


    When the shift ended, Elena walked to the bench and sat. The hum of the lights
    didn’t feel like safety anymore. It felt like a room she could step out of. She
    didn’t send a message or cancel a meeting. She didn’t make a plan. She simply
    sat, the broth growing cold in her hands, wondering if she had changed at all,
    or if she was simply learning the shape of a different comfort.'
