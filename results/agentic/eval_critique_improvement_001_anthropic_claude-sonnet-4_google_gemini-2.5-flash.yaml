  evidence: The initial versions were identical, indicating no revision between V0
    and V3. However, the final output is significantly different and addresses all
    constraints. The critiques provided were not specific enough to track granular
    changes, but the final output clearly demonstrates a strong understanding and
    implementation of the task requirements. The story successfully integrates all
    constraints, particularly the narrative purpose of the fog and the hint/reveal
    of Sarah's past case. The ending is a strong moment of decision. The characterization
    of Sarah through action is excellent.
