  evidence: 'All required constraints are present in the final output: food is symbolic
    multiple times (kimchi recalls his wife; Jeongol is explicitly described as symbolizing
    family unity; bibimbap stands for harmony), David''s attachment to his late wife
    is present without the word ''grief'' ("this was all I had left of her"), the
    daughter''s estrangement has a clear, believable cause (neglect after the mother''s
    death when David immersed himself in the restaurant), the regular Mr. Kim represents
    tradition/continuity, and a non-food Korean cultural element (samulnori drumming)
    appears. The three required beats are executed: Setup (letter, kimchi, festival),
    Midpoint Confrontation (heated argument with Mia), and Resolution (final meal,
    memorial, decision to retire/move). Minor issues: the expression of David''s loss
    is slightly direct (borderline explicit admission of why he stayed), and the resolution
    (moving to California and retirement) resolves the conflict fairly cleanly, which
    risks feeling a bit tidy—but it remains appropriately hopeful without being unrealistically
    happy.'
