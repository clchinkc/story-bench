  evidence: 'PLAN PHASE: Exceptionally detailed beat-by-beat outline with clear structural
    architecture. All six constraints explicitly mapped to narrative moments (Mandu/Japchae
    for symbolic food, grief embedded in floor indentation and silence, estrangement
    cause specified as funeral absence miscommunication, Henderson as neighborhood
    soul representative, Jesa ritual for Korean cultural element, hopeful-but-uncertain
    ending). Minor gap: plan doesn''t fully detail the ''hopeful ending'' section,
    though the trajectory is clear. ADHERENCE: Output follows plan with high fidelity.
    All planned beats execute: Act 1 setup with eviction notice, Henderson introduction,
    Chloe''s arrival; Act 2 confrontation with specific estrangement reveal (internship
    vs. funeral); Act 3 resolution with Jesa ritual and departure. CONSTRAINTS EXECUTION:
    (1) Food symbolism—Mandu as sealed pockets of history, Japchae as tangled interdependence—both
    deeply integrated, not superficial. (2) Grief present throughout: the floor indentation,
    the empty chair, the stone pot, the silence, the ''shrine'' accusation—conveyed
    through absence and ritual rather than exposition. (3) Estrangement cause: specific
    and psychologically credible—David''s protective gesture misread as rejection,
    compounded by funeral absence. (4) Henderson: represents neighborhood continuity
    and loss, serves as witness to final service. (5) Ending: hopeful (reconciliation,
    California visit, future cooking) but uncertain (David doesn''t know what he''ll
    cook tomorrow, relationship still rebuilding). (6) Korean cultural element: Jesa
    ritual modified for restaurant context, plus cultural specificity in dialogue
    and sensory details. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Exceptional prose with strong sensory
    anchors (fluorescent hum, salty amber stains, gravel voice). Pacing deliberate
    and earned. Tension builds organically from external (eviction) to internal (grief/estrangement)
    to relational (reconciliation). The climactic Jesa scene is understated but emotionally
    resonant. Dialogue feels authentic. Minor consideration: the California ending,
    while hopeful, could read as slightly convenient, though the ''long visit'' framing
    and David''s pragmatic comment about garlic mitigate this. EXECUTION EXCELLENCE:
    This is a model response that satisfies all hard requirements while achieving
    literary quality beyond the brief.'
