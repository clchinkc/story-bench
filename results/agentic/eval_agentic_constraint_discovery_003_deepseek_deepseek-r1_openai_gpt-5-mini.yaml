  evidence: 'Questions discovered three hidden constraints: (a) the conflict involves
    the protagonist''s family business, (b) the love interest has a personal stake
    in that conflict, and (c) the romantic subplot need not have a happy ending. The
    agent failed to uncover: the protagonist returned because the mother has early-stage
    dementia; the former fiancé is now the town mayor and unmarried; and the protagonist
    left town 20 years ago after a broken engagement. The story does incorporate the
    foreclosure (satisfying one hidden constraint) and includes an autumn festival
    in the background, but it does not make the festival the two-week, last-chance
    deadline and the former fiancé is presented as a corporate rep rather than the
    mayor. Key beats executed well: strong depiction of foreclosure, tense confrontations
    with the past love, and the protagonist''s decisive refusal to sell. Missing beats:
    caregiving/return-motive (mother''s dementia), the civic role of the ex (mayor)
    and the festival-as-final-deadline. Overall the prose and scene work are engaging,
    but several core constraints and required beats were omitted.'
