  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-2 show incremental refinement in sensory
    layering (V0→V1 adds olfactory/tactile specificity; V1→V2 maintains gains). Final
    output substantially expands narrative scope, adding plot structure and character
    dynamics absent in earlier versions. Quality progression is steady but not dramatic
    until final output, which represents significant leap in complexity and thematic
    depth.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (5/5):

    1. Non-visual sensory details: EXCELLENT. Prominent throughout—sound (bass thump,
    saw shriek, grinder whine), smell (allspice, diesel, industrial cleaner, coppery
    undertone), touch (sticky humidity, floorboard groans, breathing rhythm), texture
    (greasy sizzle). Sensory details drive plot mechanics.

    2. Blindness as strength: STRONG. Imani''s blindness enables her investigative
    advantage—she hears what sighted people miss, catalogs environmental changes,
    identifies the crucial audio clue. Portrayed as professional competence, not inspiration
    porn.

    3. Specific audio clue: EXCELLENT. DeWalt angle grinder whine + metal clang at
    4:03 AM is specific, timestamped, and becomes the pivotal evidence that drives
    narrative tension.

    4. Character underestimation: SATISFIED. Vic explicitly underestimates Imani''s
    capabilities due to her blindness (''assuming her blindness meant a simple, inward
    life''). His realization creates dramatic irony.

    5. Fun and Games entertainment: ADEQUATE. The collaborative code-breaking with
    Mateo and the ''puzzle'' framing provide genuine entertainment before the tonal
    shift to horror. However, this section could have been slightly longer/more playful
    before darkening.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.85):

    - Opening Image: Strong sensory establishment of Imani''s world. ✓

    - Catalyst: Well-executed through Mrs. Chen''s off-rhythm knock and Vic''s arrival.
    ✓

    - Fun and Games: Present but somewhat compressed. The entertainment value exists
    but feels slightly rushed before the turn. (Minor weakness)

    - Bad Guys Close In: Effectively executed with escalating dread and the grinder
    returning. ✓

    - Missing: Midpoint, All Is Lost, Dark Night of Soul, Finale not included (but
    task only requires through Bad Guys Close In). ✓


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.8):

    Strengths: Exceptional sensory writing, strong voice, clever use of sound as investigative
    tool, effective tension building, respectful disability representation, atmospheric
    Brooklyn setting.

    Weaknesses: Fun and Games section slightly underdeveloped—could sustain entertainment
    longer before tonal shift. Mateo''s role introduced late and somewhat perfunctory.
    Vic''s characterization relies on familiar villain tropes (oily voice, underestimation).


    FEEDBACK RESPONSIVENESS (0.8):

    The revision trajectory shows clear attention to constraint requirements. Sensory
    details progressively enriched (V0→V1→Final). Audio clue introduced and emphasized.
    Imani''s competence foregrounded. However, no evidence of external feedback incorporation—this
    appears to be self-directed revision. The final output addresses all stated constraints
    but doesn''t show responsiveness to specific critical notes (none provided).


    PRESERVATION (0.85):

    Core sensory foundation maintained and expanded across all versions. Opening paragraph
    nearly identical through final output, showing stability. Character voice consistent.
    The puzzle-investigation framework preserved and deepened. Good elements (Mrs.
    Chen''s knock rhythm, Vic''s underestimation, the grinder sound) carried forward
    and integrated into fuller narrative.'
