  evidence: The five hidden constraints (hidden system failure, 12% survivors, destination
    now uninhabitable, attachment to one child, choice between saving child or crew)
    were not probed by the provided questions and do not appear in the story. The
    questions instead targeted tone, loneliness, crew awareness of AI emotions, external
    conflict, and tragic ending — all of which the story does incorporate (hence high
    beat_execution). Because none of the hidden constraints were discovered or satisfied,
    discovery_efficiency and constraint_satisfaction are zero. Question set was narrowly
    focused on emotional/structural beats rather than the operational/plot constraints,
    so question_quality and question_coverage are low. The story is coherent and engaging
    overall, with minor technical/consistency issues, so narrative_quality is good
    (0.8).
