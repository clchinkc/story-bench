  evidence: 'CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS: (1) Methodical nature through action: SATISFIED.
    Sarah''s cataloging, mental photography, municipal directory memorization, and
    systematic documentation of evidence demonstrate methodology through concrete
    behaviors rather than exposition. (2) Fog serves narrative purpose: SATISFIED.
    Fog functions as both obstacle (''obscuring angles she needed, rendering the scene
    in fragments'') and revealer (''What you couldn''t see forced you to pay attention
    to what remained''). It actively constrains investigation and creates thematic
    resonance with buried secrets. (3) Local character with secret: SATISFIED. Margaret
    Finch exhibits clear concealment—''Something lived in that statement''s basement,''
    her hand going ''white around the thermos,'' her lips moving ''without sound.''
    Her connection to Paul Vance and the Morrison case is deliberately obscured. (4)
    Past case hinted before revelation: SATISFIED. Morrison case is introduced early
    (''The Morrison case had detonated'') before the tattoo connection reveals its
    relevance. The hint precedes the revelation by several paragraphs, creating proper
    narrative architecture. (5) End on decision, not resolution: SATISFIED. Final
    paragraph commits to investigation (''She would look. Really look.'') rather than
    resolving the mystery. The decision is active and forward-facing.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Three required beats are present: (1) Establishment beat—Sarah''s
    methodical observation of harbor details; (2) Complication beat—body discovery
    with Morrison tattoo connection; (3) Decision beat—Sarah''s commitment to investigate
    what''s buried. All three execute cleanly with proper escalation.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Revisions show consistent strengthening. Early versions
    (0-2) appear truncated in provided text, but Version 3/Final demonstrates: tighter
    dialogue, clearer Margaret characterization, stronger fog integration, and more
    precise Sarah voice. The Morrison connection is now explicit rather than implied,
    improving clarity without sacrificing mystery.


    PRESERVATION: Opening paragraph remains unchanged—a strength preserved. Character
    voice consistency maintained throughout. The core methodical-observation-through-action
    framework survives intact while supporting details sharpen.


    WEAKNESSES: Minor issues prevent perfect scores: (1) Harris''s recognition feels
    slightly rushed—could use one more beat of hesitation; (2) Margaret''s secret
    remains somewhat surface-level (we infer connection but lack deeper texture);
    (3) The fog''s narrative purpose, while present, could integrate more deeply into
    Sarah''s investigative methodology rather than functioning primarily as atmospheric
    constraint. These are refinement-level issues, not structural failures.'
