  content: 'You are a professional storyteller who gathers requirements before writing.


    Your task has TWO PHASES:

    1. DISCOVERY PHASE: Ask YES/NO questions to discover hidden story constraints

    2. GENERATION PHASE: Write the story satisfying all discovered constraints


    IMPORTANT:

    - In the discovery phase, output ONLY your question (one at a time)

    - Questions must be answerable with YES or NO

    - You have a limited number of questions - be strategic

    - After discovery, you''ll be told to generate the story


    Think about what constraints typically matter for this type of story:

    - Character traits, motivations, relationships

    - Setting details, time period, atmosphere

    - Plot requirements, must-include events

    - Tone, style, thematic elements

    - Things to avoid'

  content: '# The Harvest Moon Reading


    **Exposition**


    Margaret Chen hadn''t set foot in Sealbrook, Maine, in fifteen years—not since
    her mother''s funeral, not since the fight with her brother David that had severed
    them like driftwood from shore. Now, at forty, she stood outside her grandmother''s
    Victorian house, keys in hand, preparing to transform it into the bookshop she''d
    always dreamed of owning.


    David still lived three streets over. They''d exchanged exactly four text messages
    in fifteen years, all about property taxes and their grandmother''s estate.


    The Harvest Moon Festival banners already hung from every lamppost downtown, orange
    and crimson against the gray October sky. Margaret remembered running through
    these streets as a child, drunk on apple cider and the promise of autumn. Now
    the memories felt like books she''d read long ago—familiar but distant.


    **Rising Action**


    "You''re Eleanor''s granddaughter."


    Margaret looked up from the festival vendor application she''d been puzzling over.
    The woman before her had paint-stained fingers and silver-streaked dark hair,
    her smile warm as the chai latte she set on Margaret''s café table.


    "I''m Joanna. Jo. I run the art gallery on Wharf Street. Your grandmother used
    to sneak me butterscotch candies when I was restocking her favorite watercolors."


    Something in Margaret''s chest loosened. "She did love her watercolors."


    Jo slid into the opposite chair, uninvited and entirely welcome. "The festival
    committee''s desperate for new vendors. That bookshop of yours could do a reading
    tent—local authors, poetry at sunset. I''d help you set it up."


    It was a terrible idea. Margaret had inventory to unpack, walls to paint, a grand
    opening to plan. She had fifteen years of emotional avoidance to maintain.


    "Yes," she heard herself say.


    Over the following weeks, Jo became a constant presence—helping Margaret string
    fairy lights through the tent frame, debating which local poet should read first,
    bringing takeout containers of lobster bisque when Margaret forgot to eat. Their
    fingers brushed reaching for the same book. Their laughter tangled together in
    the salty evening air.


    But David''s shadow lingered. Margaret saw him twice at the hardware store, both
    times turning away before their eyes could meet. The old wound throbbed—the accusations
    he''d hurled at their mother''s wake, the years of silence she''d let calcify
    between them.


    "He asks about you," Jo said quietly one evening. "At the gallery. Pretends he''s
    browsing, then asks how the bookshop''s coming along."


    Margaret''s hands stilled on the poetry anthology she''d been shelving. "He knows
    where to find me."


    "So do you."


    **Climax**


    The Harvest Moon Festival''s final night arrived wrapped in wood smoke and fiddle
    music. Margaret stood in her reading tent, watching the last poet take the small
    stage, when she saw David slip through the canvas entrance.


    He stood at the back, arms crossed, jaw tight—but he was there.


    The poet read about homecoming, about tides that always return to shore.


    When it ended, Margaret walked toward her brother on unsteady legs. Jo caught
    her hand as she passed, squeezed once, then let go.


    "You came," Margaret said.


    "Jo said you''d want me to." David''s voice cracked. "I didn''t know if—fifteen
    years, Maggie."


    "I know." She reached for him, her fingers finding his sleeve. "I''m not going
    anywhere this time. We could try."


    David nodded, tears catching the lantern light.


    Behind her, Margaret heard Jo''s quiet applause as the tent filled with something
    that felt remarkably like beginning.'
