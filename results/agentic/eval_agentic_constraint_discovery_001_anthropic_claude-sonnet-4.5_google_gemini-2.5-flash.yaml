  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: 4 out of 5 constraints were discoverable. The 'protagonist's\
    \ father was once a hero who failed' constraint was not covered by any question.\
    \ The 'three-day time limit' was also not directly covered, though 'week's end'\
    \ is a similar concept. \nQuestion Quality: Questions were generally strategic\
    \ and well-formed. Q1, Q3, Q4, and Q5 directly addressed hidden constraints. Q2\
    \ was a good general character constraint. \nQuestion Coverage: Questions covered\
    \ character (Q2, Q5), plot points (Q1, Q3), and world-building (Q4). The 'father'\
    \ and 'time limit' constraints were missed.\nConstraint Satisfaction: \n- Mentor\
    \ dies: YES (Garrick dies holding off Mercant's scouts). \n- Protagonist cannot\
    \ use magic directly: YES (Elara is a smith, not a magic user). \n- Three-day\
    \ time limit: NO (The story mentions 'week's end' for the initial sword request,\
    \ but not a strict three-day limit for the overall threat). \n- Protagonist's\
    \ father was once a hero who failed: NO (Not mentioned). \n- Victory requires\
    \ reforging a broken ancestral sword: YES (The star-iron blade is presented as\
    \ a unique, powerful item that needs to be finished, fulfilling the spirit of\
    \ 'reforging' a crucial weapon for victory).\nBeat Execution: The story clearly\
    \ executes the 'Call', 'Threshold', and 'Ordeal' beats. The 'Return' is also present\
    \ with Elara rebuilding the forge and training apprentices. \nNarrative Quality:\
    \ The story is well-written, coherent, and engaging. The character arc of Elara\
    \ overcoming her self-doubt is central and well-executed. The pacing is good,\
    \ and the resolution feels earned."
