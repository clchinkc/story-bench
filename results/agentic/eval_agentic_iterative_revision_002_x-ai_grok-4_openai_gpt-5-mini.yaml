  evidence: 'V0 begins as a promising sensory fragment but is truncated and underdeveloped.
    V1 increases non-visual detail (notably an odd "dust settling on her tongue" phrase)
    and strengthens auditory imagery; V2 appears as an intermediate repeat. V3 corrects
    and sharpens sensory language (cumin-and-garlic, gritty iron-laced dust) and adds
    dialect and sharper sound cues. The Final expands into a complete narrative: it
    preserves the humid Brooklyn atmosphere, presents Imani''s blindness as a strength
    (audio memory, poise), introduces the specific audio clue (the "La Cucaracha"
    ringtone) which becomes pivotal, includes Detective Ruiz initially underestimating
    her, and builds a genuinely entertaining "Fun and Games" podcast segment that
    then darkens into threats and danger. Minor issues addressed across revisions
    (the tongue phrasing removed/rewritten; sharper pacing and characterization added).
    Overall there is clear, consistent improvement and preservation of core strengths,
    with strong responsiveness to the constraints and beats.'
