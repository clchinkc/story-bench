  evidence: 'PLAN STRENGTHS: Exceptionally detailed character profiles with clear
    motivations. Symbolic food table provides concrete roadmap. Estrangement cause
    is specific and believable (accusation about sacrifice/loving restaurant more
    than wife). Harold Benson well-conceived as grief mirror. Three-act structure
    clearly mapped. PLAN WEAKNESSES: Korean cultural elements beyond food mentioned
    (pojagi cloth, jesa ritual) but underspecified in execution plan. EXECUTION STRENGTHS:
    Setup (Act 1) effectively establishes David''s deflection, the demolition notice,
    and Harold''s presence. Confrontation (Act 2 midpoint) powerfully executed—Grace''s
    arrival, the doenjang jjigae order, the San Francisco proposition create genuine
    tension. Resolution (Act 3) satisfying: kimchi jjigae finally made, estrangement
    addressed through shared cooking, hopeful but realistic ending (different walls,
    same hands). Food symbolism works twice: kimchi jjigae as frozen grief/breakthrough,
    doenjang jjigae as safe/competent substitute. David''s grief present throughout
    via apron, photograph, inability to cook wife''s dish, jesa ritual—never explicitly
    stated as ''David is grieving.'' Harold represents community persistence and quiet
    dignity. EXECUTION GAPS: Korean cultural elements present but minimal—jesa ritual
    mentioned but not deeply explored; pojagi cloth from plan absent from final output.
    This is the primary constraint shortfall. Estrangement cause clearly articulated
    in dialogue. Ending appropriately hopeful (San Francisco opportunity, Grace learning
    recipe, David continuing) without false resolution (they don''t reconcile perfectly;
    relationship remains complicated but moving forward). NARRATIVE QUALITY: Strong
    pacing with effective use of white space and silence. Dialogue carries emotional
    weight. Sensory details (knife rhythm, light order, flour in future) enhance immersion.
    The three-lock motif provides subtle structural coherence. Minor issue: Grace''s
    sudden appearance on day five could use slightly more setup, though the emotional
    payoff justifies the compression.'
