  evidence: 'Quality clearly improves across revisions. V0 is a brief opening that
    establishes braille and a time-check sound but is spare. V1 adds tactile humidity
    and slightly richer phrasing, making the listening motif clearer. V2 introduces
    stronger sensory language (July heat like a wet towel) and early worldbuilding
    (she''d asked the city to fix it), increasing character context. V3 deepens multisensory
    detail (smell of garbage and halal cart, the cart ''rang like a tuning fork'')
    and sharpens the hook. The Final version preserves core elements (braille display,
    Mr. Chen''s cart at 2:47, Imani''s listening skill) while expanding into full
    story beats: a clear Catalyst (Detective Ramirez), an entertaining Fun and Games
    (Imani cataloguing city sounds, hunting the backup beep, outsmarting the alibi),
    and a tense Bad Guys Close In (intruder entering, bleach smell, the underestimation
    line ''What''s a blind girl gonna do about it?''). Specific audio clues (the dog
    barking in ''Jingle Bells'' rhythm and the cement-mixer backup beep) are introduced
    and used crucially. Imani''s blindness is portrayed as a strength throughout.
    Overall the revisions show consistent, constructive enhancement of sensory detail,
    plot, and stakes while preserving the original pattern-listening concept.'
