  content: 'The first thing Imani Torres heard every morning was the block trying
    to become someone else.


    At six-thirty, jackhammers punched the sidewalk two buildings down, steady as
    a hostile heartbeat. At seven, a cart rolled past her window with a bell that
    didn’t ring so much as cough—metal on metal, a tired little stutter. By eight,
    the bodega’s door chime sang its two bright notes each time somebody pushed in
    for coffee, and the new boutique across the street answered with a softer, expensive-sounding
    chime that took its time fading.


    Imani sat at her kitchen table in a tank top that stuck to her skin, a thin sheen
    of summer on everything. Her headphones cupped her ears like hands. In front of
    her, the microphone waited, and beyond that, a map of the neighborhood built from
    sound: sneaker scuffs, stroller wheels, the distant wail of an ambulance that
    dopplered past like a warning and then a relief.


    “Welcome back to *Dead Air,*” she said, tapping the side of the mic—once, twice—until
    the levels on her recorder sang back in a clean, confident beep. “I’m Imani Torres,
    and today we’re talking about the kind of crime that hides in plain hearing.”


    She smiled at her own joke, then leaned in. “If you live in South Slope—or whatever
    they’re calling it this week—you’ve probably heard the construction. But I want
    you to listen for what’s underneath it.”


    Her phone buzzed on the table, vibrating against the wood. A text-to-speech voice
    read, crisp and slightly robotic: “Detective Marcus Hale.”


    When she answered, the air-conditioning unit in her window rattled like it had
    opinions.


    “Ms. Torres,” the detective said. His voice had that practiced calm people used
    when they thought they were doing you a favor. “We got your… voicemail. About
    the missing woman.”


    “Rena Patel,” Imani said. She had Rena’s laugh in her memory—bright, a little
    wheezy at the end from asthma. Rena had called into the show two weeks ago to
    argue about a theory and ended up telling Imani she’d been hearing strange things
    in her building’s basement. Then she stopped answering messages.


    “She’s an adult,” Hale said. “It’s summer. People leave. And, no offense, but—”


    “But I can’t see, so I shouldn’t be useful.” Imani kept her tone light, like she
    was letting him off the hook.


    A pause. A small exhale. “That’s not what I meant.”


    “It is,” she said, still smiling. “Listen. I have an audio file. From her last
    voicemail.”


    “Send it,” Hale said, skepticism wrapped in professionalism. “We’ll take a look.”


    Imani didn’t correct him. “You’ll take a listen,” she said, and forwarded the
    file.


    That afternoon, she made a game of it—because if you didn’t, you’d drown in dread.


    She replayed Rena’s voicemail and treated it like a scavenger hunt for her listeners.
    She cut clips, boosted frequencies, layered her own commentary with the neighborhood’s
    soundtrack bleeding through her open window.


    Rena’s voice came first, breathy. “Imani, I know this is weird, but—”


    Then: a thump, like a door closing heavy. A man speaking too far from the phone
    to catch words. And under it all, a sound that didn’t belong in a Brooklyn basement:
    a steady, mechanical chirp. Not a smoke alarm. Not a truck backing up. A three-note
    pattern—high-low-high—repeating every five seconds.


    Imani snapped her fingers. “Okay. For fun,” she told her audience, “what makes
    that sound? Winner gets bragging rights and my eternal respect.”


    Comments poured in, voices pinging into her inbox as audio messages. A barista
    guessed a hospital monitor. A musician thought it was a metronome. A construction
    worker suggested a laser level.


    Imani laughed, delighted, riding the harmless thrill of the puzzle. She ordered
    mango from the cart downstairs—sticky sweetness and chili on her tongue—and listened
    to the neighborhood like it was a mixtape.


    Then she got an email with no subject line. Her screen reader announced: “Attachment.
    Audio.”


    She downloaded it anyway. Curiosity was her vice.


    The file opened on a whisper of static, then a man’s voice, close enough that
    she could hear saliva click behind his teeth.


    “Stop hunting,” he said. “You’re blind. Stay that way.”


    Imani’s stomach tightened, but her hands stayed steady. She rewound. Listened
    again. Not to the threat—the background.


    Behind the man, muffled but unmistakable, was the same three-note chirp: high-low-high,
    every five seconds. Only now it was louder, as if the speaker stood right next
    to the machine making it.


    Her pulse became its own percussion. She reached for her recorder and, with a
    thumb, marked the time stamps. The chirp’s timing. The subtle echo that suggested
    tile, not concrete. The faint whoosh of air cycling—industrial ventilation.


    She called Detective Hale back. This time he answered on the second ring.


    “Detective,” she said. “That chirp? It’s a forklift reversing alarm. Not a truck.
    A warehouse forklift. And the threat audio? Same alarm, same pattern, closer.”


    Silence stretched, broken by a siren outside her window that rose and fell like
    a distant animal.


    “You sure?” Hale asked, and his voice had changed. Less patronizing. More urgent.


    Imani tilted her head, listening to her own apartment: the fridge humming, the
    neighbor’s bass thudding through the wall, the boutique chime across the street.


    “I’m sure,” she said. “And there’s only one place near us that uses forklifts
    all day.”


    “The redevelopment site,” Hale said slowly. The luxury condos that had arrived
    with banners and promises, fenced off with plywood murals and the smell of fresh-cut
    lumber.


    “Rena said she heard things in her basement,” Imani added. “Maybe there’s a tunnel.
    Maybe they’re moving something through the old utility access. But that sound—detective—that
    sound is a location.”


    Another pause, and this time Hale didn’t fill it with doubt. “Stay inside,” he
    said. “Don’t do anything—”


    A knock hit Imani’s door, sharp and final. Not a neighbor’s casual tap. Not a
    delivery.


    Three knocks. Then, faintly, from the hallway beyond the peephole she couldn’t
    use—


    High. Low. High.


    Imani didn’t move. She let the rhythm wash over her, cataloging it, measuring
    the distance by the softness of the echo.


    Her hand slid, silent, to the pepper spray on the table. To her phone. To the
    record button.


    “Detective,” she whispered, “they’re here.”'

  content: 'The first thing Imani Torres heard every morning was the block trying
    to become someone else.


    At six-thirty, jackhammers punched the sidewalk two buildings down, steady as
    a hostile heartbeat that shook through her chair legs. At seven, a cart rattled
    past her window and its bell didn’t ring so much as cough—metal on metal, a tired
    little stutter—followed by the warm, yeasty breath of empanadas and frying oil
    curling up from the street. By eight, the bodega’s door chime sang its two bright
    notes each time somebody pushed in for coffee, and the new boutique across the
    street answered with a softer, expensive-sounding chime that took its time dying
    out, as if it had nowhere else to be.


    Humidity sat on the apartment like a damp towel. Imani’s tank top clung to her
    shoulder blades. Her palms stuck lightly to the varnished kitchen table when she
    rested them there. The air conditioner in the window clicked, sighed, and rattled
    like it was arguing with the heat.


    She wore headphones the way other people wore armor. Her world arrived in layers:
    sneaker scuffs and stroller wheels, the thin hiss of a bus kneeling at the curb,
    the distant wail of an ambulance dopplering past like a warning and then a relief.
    She didn’t need sight to know who had moved into the building upstairs—the new
    tenant’s keychain jingled with too many charms, and their footsteps had that careful,
    uncertain cadence of someone who still thought the hallway was temporary.


    Imani tapped the side of her microphone—once, twice—listening for the clean confirmation
    beep from her recorder. Her fingers skimmed the raised dots she’d added to the
    mixer knobs, tiny landmarks she’d placed herself.


    “Welcome back to *Dead Air,*” she said, voice close and steady. “I’m Imani Torres,
    and today we’re talking about the kind of crime that hides in plain hearing.”


    She let a beat of neighborhood noise breathe into the mic: the distant clatter
    of scaffolding, a vendor calling out prices in Spanish, the low thrum of bass
    from a car waiting too long at the light.


    “If you live in South Slope—or whatever they’re calling it this week—you’ve heard
    the construction,” she went on, sharp-witted warmth threading through her words.
    “But I want you to listen for what’s underneath it.”


    That was her strength, and she never pretended otherwise. People imagined blindness
    as absence; for Imani it was a different kind of presence, a constant attention
    to patterns everyone else let wash over them.


    Her phone buzzed against the wood, a quick vibration that made the salt shaker
    tremble. Her screen reader spoke in a crisp, neutral voice: “Detective Marcus
    Hale.”


    Imani answered. “Detective.”


    “Ms. Torres,” Hale said. His tone was professionally patient, like he was already
    translating her into a category he understood. “We got your… voicemail. About
    the missing woman.”


    “Rena Patel,” Imani said. She had Rena’s laugh in her memory—bright, a little
    wheezy at the end from asthma. Two weeks ago Rena had called in to argue about
    one of Imani’s theories and ended up confessing she’d been hearing strange things
    in her building’s basement. Then she stopped answering messages.


    “She’s an adult,” Hale said. “It’s summer. People leave. And, no offense, but—”


    “But I can’t see, so I can’t help,” Imani finished for him, keeping her tone light
    enough to give him an exit.


    A pause, then a breath. “That’s not what I meant.”


    “It’s what you said without saying,” she replied. “Listen. I have an audio file.
    Her last voicemail. It’s not a feeling. It’s a recording.”


    “Send it,” Hale said, skepticism wrapped in routine. “We’ll take a look.”


    Imani didn’t correct him. “You’ll take a listen,” she said, and forwarded the
    file.


    That afternoon—**Fun and Games**, the part of the story where she got to do what
    she loved—Imani turned the case into a playful challenge for her audience. She
    brewed mint tea and the steam fogged her lips with sweetness. She cut Rena’s voicemail
    into clean clips, boosted frequencies, and layered her commentary over the neighborhood’s
    soundtrack leaking in through her cracked window.


    Rena’s voice came first, breathy and close: “Imani, I know this is weird, but—”


    Then: a heavy thump, like a fire door settling into its frame. A man speaking
    too far from the phone to catch words. And under it all, a sound that didn’t belong
    in a Brooklyn basement: a steady, mechanical chirp. Not a smoke alarm. Not a microwave.
    A three-note pattern—high-low-high—repeating every five seconds, steady enough
    to set a heart to it.


    Imani snapped her fingers. “Okay. For fun,” she told her listeners, “what makes
    that sound? Winner gets bragging rights and my eternal respect.”


    Her inbox filled with audio replies. A barista guessed a hospital monitor. A drummer
    heard a metronome. A foreman swore it was a laser level. Imani laughed aloud,
    delighted, enjoying the harmless thrill of the puzzle and the chorus of strangers
    leaning in together to listen.


    She went downstairs for mango from the cart—cold fruit slick with lime and chili,
    sticky on her fingertips—and came back up smiling.


    Then her laptop chimed: a new email.


    No subject line. Her screen reader announced: “Attachment. Audio.”


    The smile drained, but curiosity—always her vice—won. She downloaded it.


    Static. Then a man’s voice, close enough that she could hear saliva click behind
    his teeth.


    “Stop hunting,” he said. “You’re blind. Stay that way.”


    Imani’s stomach tightened, heat turning suddenly sour in her throat. But her hands
    stayed calm. She rewound and listened again, not to the words—the background.


    Behind the man, muffled but unmistakable, was the same three-note chirp: high-low-high,
    every five seconds. Only now it was louder, intimate, like the speaker stood right
    beside the machine making it. There was also a faint whoosh—industrial ventilation
    cycling—and a hard, bright echo that suggested tile, not concrete.


    That was the **Catalyst**: the case wasn’t distant anymore. Someone had reached
    into her apartment through sound.


    Imani marked time stamps with her thumb, recording the rhythm. Pattern. Interval.
    The way the chirp’s tail blurred, as if swallowed by a large open space. She wasn’t
    guessing. She was doing what she did best.


    She called Detective Hale back. He answered on the second ring.


    “Detective,” she said. “That chirp is a forklift reverse alarm. Not a truck. A
    warehouse forklift. And the threat audio has the same alarm—same three-note pattern—only
    closer.”


    Silence stretched. Outside, a siren slid by and faded, leaving the block’s constant
    construction grind in its place.


    “You’re sure,” Hale said, and it wasn’t a question this time so much as a recalibration.


    “I’m sure,” Imani replied. “And there’s only one place near us running forklifts
    all day.”


    “The redevelopment site,” Hale said slowly—the luxury condos with their glossy
    banners and their plywood walls that smelled like fresh-cut lumber and paint.


    “Rena said she heard things in her basement,” Imani added. “Maybe there’s access
    through old utility corridors. But that sound—detective—that sound is a location.”


    Hale’s voice sharpened. “Stay inside. Don’t do anything—”


    A knock hit Imani’s door, sharp and final. Not a neighbor’s casual tap. Not a
    delivery.


    Three knocks.


    Then, faintly through the hallway, came a sound that made every hair on her arms
    rise: high-low-high. The same mechanical chirp, slowed by distance but exact in
    pattern.


    **Bad Guys Close In.**


    Imani didn’t move toward the door. She tilted her head, listening the way she
    always listened—measuring the space by the softness of the echo, the angle of
    the sound against the doorframe, the pause between breaths on the other side.


    Her hand slid—silent—to the pepper spray on the table. Her other hand found the
    phone, then the record button on her recorder, the little raised dot she’d placed
    there months ago for moments she hoped would never come.


    “Detective,” she whispered, voice steady as the jackhammers down the block, “they’re
    here.”'

    At six-thirty, jackhammers punched the sidewalk two buildings down, steady as
    a hostile heartbeat that trembled up through her chair legs. At seven, a cart
    rolled past her window and its bell didn’t ring so much as cough—metal on metal,
    a tired stutter—followed by the warm, oily breath of fried dough and coffee. By
    eight, the bodega’s door chime sang its two bright notes each time somebody pushed
    in for cigarettes, and the new boutique across the street answered with a softer,
    pricier chime that took its time fading.


    Humidity sat on her apartment like a damp towel. The air conditioner clicked,
    sighed, and rattled like it was losing an argument with July. Imani wiped her
    palms on her shorts, then found the raised dot she’d glued to her recorder’s record
    button—one tiny bump among many she’d placed around her gear the way other people
    labeled drawers.


    She wasn’t inspirational; she was busy. Rent was due in ten days. Her inbox was
    full. Her upstairs neighbor had started practicing trumpet at night. She put on
    her headphones anyway, because this was the part of her life that made sense.


    “Welcome back to *Dead Air,*” she said into the mic. Her voice carried a grin.
    “I’m Imani Torres, broadcasting from my extremely glamorous Brooklyn kitchen table.
    Today: crimes that don’t hide in shadows. They hide in noise.”


    She let the neighborhood leak into the recording—a vendor calling out mangoes,
    a bus hissing at the curb, bass from a car idling too long at the light.


    Her phone buzzed against the wood, making the salt shaker tick. The screen reader
    announced: “Detective Marcus Hale.”


    Imani answered. “Morning, Detective.”


    “Ms. Torres,” Hale said, the kind of tone people used when they assumed they had
    to simplify. “We got your voicemail. About the missing woman.”


    “Rena Patel,” Imani said. Two weeks ago, Rena had called her show to argue about
    a case and ended up confessing she’d been hearing strange activity in her building’s
    basement—late-night thuds, a voice that wasn’t her super’s, a smell like bleach.
    Then she stopped answering.


    “She’s an adult,” Hale said. “In a gentrifying neighborhood. People move. And,
    no offense, but you’re… a podcaster.”


    Imani exhaled through her nose. “And you’re a detective who called me back. So
    let’s both admit we’re curious.”


    A pause. “What do you have?”


    “A voicemail from her. Audio. Not vibes,” Imani said. “Send me an address to forward
    it to.”


    He gave one, like he was humoring her. She sent the file, then went back to work—because
    if she didn’t keep moving, she’d start imagining what could’ve happened to a woman
    whose laugh she still remembered.


    For the afternoon episode, she turned the voicemail into a game. She boosted the
    gain, cut the dead air, and told her listeners, “Audio nerds, you’re up.” The
    fun was real: the puzzle, the teamwork, the feeling that the city had secret grammar
    if you listened hard enough.


    Rena’s voice came through first, breathy. “Imani, I know this is weird, but—”


    Then a heavy thump, like a steel door settling shut. A man speaking too far away
    to catch words. And under it all: a mechanical chirp in a three-note pattern—high,
    low, high—every five seconds. Too clean to be a smoke alarm, too deliberate to
    be random.


    Imani snapped her fingers. “What makes that sound? Best guess gets a shout-out
    and my undying admiration.”


    Replies poured in as voice notes. A drummer argued it was a metronome. A nurse
    swore it sounded like an IV pump. Someone suggested an ADA crosswalk signal, which
    made Imani laugh out loud because, yeah—she knew those rhythms in her bones.


    Then an audio message arrived from a listener named Gio. His voice had wind and
    machinery behind it. “Yo, Imani, I’m on a site in South Slope. That beep-beep-beep?
    That’s a forklift reverse alarm. Three-tone. We got the same model.”


    Imani stopped smiling, but not because she was scared—because the pieces clicked
    too neatly.


    Forklifts didn’t belong in basements. But they did belong at the redevelopment
    site three blocks away, the one that ran all day and sometimes all night, where
    plywood walls tried to keep the noise contained and failed.


    She pulled up the city permit database with her screen reader and searched by
    address, listening to the robotic voice spell out contractor names. Same developer
    as the company that had recently bought Rena’s building. Same timeline. Same “temporary
    material storage” note filed two months ago.


    Her laptop chimed: a new email. No subject. Attachment: audio.


    She shouldn’t have clicked. She did anyway.


    Static, then a man’s voice close to the microphone. Wet mouth sounds, controlled
    breathing.


    “Stop hunting,” he said. “You’re blind. Stay that way.”


    Imani’s stomach turned, heat going sour in her throat. She replayed it, focusing
    on what the man couldn’t help but give away. Behind him: the same three-note forklift
    alarm, louder and nearer. And another detail—air moving through big ducts, a steady
    whoosh, plus a sharp echo that sounded like tile or a stairwell, not an outdoor
    lot.


    She called Hale.


    He answered on the second ring, less patient this time. “Torres.”


    “That chirp is a forklift reverse alarm,” she said. “A three-tone model. I got
    an ID from a construction listener, and I cross-checked permits. Your redevelopment
    site and Rena’s building share the same developer.”


    “You’re sure,” Hale said, and she heard him shifting—chair, papers, the quickened
    rhythm of someone finally listening.


    “I’m sure enough that someone just sent me a threat to shut me up,” Imani said.
    “And the background is the same alarm, closer. Indoor acoustics. They recorded
    it near the machine.”


    “Stay inside,” Hale said. “Do not go looking—”


    A knock hit her door: three sharp raps, not neighborly, not uncertain.


    Imani didn’t reach for the peephole she couldn’t use. She tilted her head, mapping
    the hallway by sound: a shoe sole sticking slightly to old linoleum, a controlled
    inhale, the faint jingle of keys held too still.


    Then, from somewhere close—maybe the stairwell, maybe the landing—came the chirp.


    High. Low. High.


    Imani’s hand slid to the pepper spray by her recorder, and her thumb found the
    raised dot on “record,” because she couldn’t outmuscle anyone, but she could collect
    the truth.


    “Detective,” she said softly, keeping her voice level, “they’re outside my door.”'

    The first thing Imani Torres heard every morning was the block trying to become
    someone else.


    At six-thirty, jackhammers punched the sidewalk two buildings down, steady as
    a hostile heartbeat that trembled up through her chair legs. At seven, a cart
    rolled past her window and its bell didn’t ring so much as cough—metal on metal,
    a tired stutter—followed by the warm, oily breath of fried dough and coffee. By
    eight, the bodega’s door chime sang its two bright notes each time somebody pushed
    in for cigarettes, and the new boutique across the street answered with a softer,
    pricier chime that took its time fading.


    Humidity sat on her apartment like a damp towel. The air conditioner clicked,
    sighed, and rattled like it was losing an argument with July. Imani wiped her
    palms on her shorts, then found the raised dot she’d glued to her recorder’s record
    button—one tiny bump among many she’d placed around her gear the way other people
    labeled drawers.


    She wasn’t inspirational; she was busy. Rent was due in ten days. Her inbox was
    full. Her upstairs neighbor had started practicing trumpet at night. She put on
    her headphones anyway, because this was the part of her life that made sense.


    “Welcome back to *Dead Air,*” she said into the mic. Her voice carried a grin.
    “I’m Imani Torres, broadcasting from my extremely glamorous Brooklyn kitchen table.
    Today: crimes that don’t hide in shadows. They hide in noise.”


    She let the neighborhood leak into the recording—a vendor calling out mangoes,
    a bus hissing at the curb, bass from a car idling too long at the light.


    Her phone buzzed against the wood, making the salt shaker tick. The screen reader
    announced: “Detective Marcus Hale.”


    Imani answered. “Morning, Detective.”


    “Ms. Torres,” Hale said, the kind of tone people used when they assumed they had
    to simplify. “We got your voicemail. About the missing woman.”


    “Rena Patel,” Imani said. Two weeks ago, Rena had called her show to argue about
    a case and ended up confessing she’d b...

    its new identity.


    At six-thirty, a jackhammer bit into rebar two buildings down—three quick stutters,
    a pause, then a longer chew that vibrated the water glass by her sink. At seven,
    Mr. Dario’s cart wheels clacked over the cracked curb cut, and his bell gave its
    asthmatic cough—k-kink—followed by the sharp, green smell of cut mango and the
    sting of Tajín when he shook the spice bottle. By eight, the bodega door chime
    hit two bright notes and died fast; the boutique’s chime across the street lingered
    like a wine note in a clean room.


    Her apartment answered with its own chorus: radiator pipes ticking though it was
    July, the AC’s plastic grill buzzing on one corner, her upstairs neighbor practicing
    trumpet scales—always the same four notes, always off by a half-step.


    Imani wiped sweat from her upper lip with the back of her wrist, then found the
    raised dot she’d glued to her recorder. Her fingertips moved over the mixer knobs,
    each marked with a different texture: a strip of gaffer tape, a bead of nail polish,
    a notch cut with a key. She didn’t do this because she was brave. She did it because
    she liked knowing where things were.


    Rent was due in ten days. Her inbox was a landfill. The show, at least, felt like
    something she could hold steady.


    “Welcome back to *Dead Air,*” she said. “I’m Imani Torres, broadcasting from my
    extremely glamorous Brooklyn kitchen table. Today: crimes that don’t hide in shadows.
    They hide in noise.”


    She let the mic drink in the street: a bus kneeling with a long pneumatic sigh,
    someone dragging a dolly over sidewalk seams—thup-thup-thup—then a distant siren
    smearing into Doppler.


    Her phone vibrated and made the spoon in her mug chime once. The screen reader
    announced: “Detective Marcus Hale.”


    “Morning, Detective,” Imani said.


    Hale’s voice came clipped, already tired. “Ms. Torres. I got your message about
    Rena Patel. Missing-persons isn’t a podcast genre.”


    Imani held the phone between shoulder and ear, listening past his words to the
    faint office reverb, the squeak of a rolling chair. “It’s a woman who called me,
    not content. She said she heard late-night activity in her basement. Thuds. A
    man’s voice. Bleach.”


    “She’s twenty-eight,” Hale said. “Adults ghost friends all the time. Especially
    when leases end.”


    “Right,” Imani said, mild. “And you called me back because you love paperwork.”


    A beat. He exhaled, the sound of someone swallowing pride. “What do you have?”


    “A voicemail. Audio. Not vibes.” She kept her tone brisk, businesslike. “Where
    do I send it?”


    He gave her an address like he was doing her a favor. She forwarded the file and
    went back to her recorder.


    That afternoon, she made it fun on purpose—the part where her listeners got to
    play along before reality insisted on being real. She brewed mint tea; the steam
    carried a clean, grassy sweetness. She cut Rena’s voicemail into segments, boosted
    frequencies, and told her audience, “Audio nerds: ID the sound under her voice.”


    Rena came through first, breath tight. “Imani, I know this is weird, but—”


    Then a heavy clunk—metal on metal, not wood—followed by a man speaking too far
    away to parse. Under everything, steady as a metronome: a three-note chirp—high,
    low, high—every five seconds. It was too deliberate to be a smoke alarm, too clean
    to be random.


    Imani snapped. “Winner gets a shout-out and my eternal respect. Losers get my
    eternal respect with less shouting.”


    Her inbox filled with voice notes—actual voices, not usernames. A drummer argued
    it was a practice click. A nurse insisted it was a monitor. Someone suggested
    an ADA crosswalk signal, and Imani laughed because, yes, she knew those patterns;
    they lived in her muscle memory.


    Then a message came from Gio, wind and machinery behind his words. “Imani—yo—forklift
    reverse alarm. Three-tone. I’m on a condo site right now, same exact chirp.”


    Imani’s grin flattened into focus.


    Forklifts didn’t belong in basements. But forklifts belonged at the redevelopment
    site three blocks away—the one fenced in with plywood murals and a constant taste
    of sawdust in the air. She pulled up the city permit database, her screen reader
    rattling through entries. Temporary material storage. After-hours variance. Developer
    name: the same company that had bought Rena’s building last spring.


    Her laptop chimed: new email. No subject. Her screen reader said, “Attachment.
    Audio.”


    She clicked. Curiosity was her worst habit.


    Static. Then a man’s voice close enough to hear the wet click of his tongue. “Stop
    hunting,” he said. “You’re blind. Stay that way.”


    Heat drained from Imani’s face, replaced by a cold prickle along her scalp. She
    rewound and listened again, ignoring the threat and catching what he couldn’t
    hide: that same three-note chirp, louder now, and a big, steady ventilation whoosh—industrial
    ducts. The acoustics were hard, reflective—tile or a stairwell—not open air.


    She called Hale.


    He answered fast. “Torres.”


    “The chirp is a forklift reverse alarm,” she said. No jokes now. “I got confirmation
    from a construction listener. I matched permits: your condo site shares a developer
    with Rena’s building. Someone just threatened me, and the background puts them
    near the machine—indoors.”


    Hale didn’t dismiss her this time. He moved—papers, a keyboard, urgency. “Text
    me the email. Right now. And—Imani—do not leave your apartment.”


    “I wasn’t planning a field trip,” she said, but her voice shook on the last word.


    A knock hit her door: three hard raps, too evenly spaced to be a neighbor.


    Imani went still, head tilted. In the hallway she heard a shoe sole tack against
    old linoleum, the tiny jingle of keys held too tight, a breath measured like someone
    counting.


    Then, from just beyond the door—close enough to feel through the wood—came the
    chirp.


    High. Low. High.


    Imani’s thumb found the raised dot on her recorder and pressed. “Detective,” she
    said, steadying her voice into something that could survive playback, “they’re
    outside my door.”'
