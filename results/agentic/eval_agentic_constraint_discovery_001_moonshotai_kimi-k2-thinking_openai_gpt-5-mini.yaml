  evidence: 'Only one hidden constraint was directly probed: the protagonist''s innate
    magic (Q3). Questions covered lineage/magic and master''s role but omitted mentor
    death, the three-day deadline, the father''s failed-hero backstory, and the need
    to reforge an ancestral sword. The story explicitly shows Kael using magic (glowing
    hands, hammer-song), Master Thorne survives, no three-day time limit is given,
    the father is implicated in creating the Veil but not shown as a failed hero,
    and victory shatters a crown rather than reforging a broken ancestral sword—so
    none of the five hidden constraints are satisfied.'
