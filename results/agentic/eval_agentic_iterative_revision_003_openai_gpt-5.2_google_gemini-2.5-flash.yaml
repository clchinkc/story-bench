  evidence: The initial versions (0-3) were identical, focusing only on minor descriptive
    additions to the setting. The final output, however, significantly expands the
    narrative, introducing characters, dialogue, and plot points that directly address
    the constraints. The quality improved dramatically from a mere setting description
    to a developed scene with character conflict and resolution. The agent successfully
    preserved the strong opening description while building a compelling story around
    it.
