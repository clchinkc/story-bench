  evidence: V0 established Sarah's methodical habits but was lighter on plot connections.
    Subsequent revisions progressively added the body discovery, the tattoo tie to
    the Morrison case, and Margaret's meaningful physical reactions; the fog's obstructive,
    plot-driving role was emphasized. Strengths (methodical actions, local color)
    were retained; weaknesses remaining are minor stylistic slips (e.g., 'then written')
    and occasional slight telling rather than purely showing. Overall the story tightened
    across versions, culminating in a clear hint-then-reveal of the past case and
    a true decision-point ending.
