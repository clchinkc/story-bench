  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The revisions show modest refinement in sensory
    details (Version 3''s ''diesel and something rotting'' vs Version 0''s generic
    ''salt and decay''), but fail to substantively address the core critique concern
    about fog serving narrative purpose beyond atmosphere. The fog remains largely
    decorative rather than functionally integrated into plot mechanics. Score: 0.72
    reflects incremental polish without addressing fundamental structural feedback.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Across three versions, changes are primarily cosmetic
    (word choice, sensory specificity) rather than structural. The body discovery,
    bartender evasiveness, and fisherman absence remain constant. No new scenes added
    to strengthen constraint satisfaction. The final output doesn''t demonstrate learning
    from critique scores (0.75→0.82→0.80) that flagged specific gaps. Score: 0.68
    reflects minimal substantive evolution.


    PRESERVATION: Strong methodical characterization maintained throughout (''notepad
    in hand,'' ''jotted down his demeanor,'' ''cataloging details''). Local secrets
    (fisherman''s absence, bartender''s evasion) preserved. Past case hints (''body
    tied to her past,'' scar recognition, ''three victims'') consistently present.
    Strengths in character voice and secret establishment well-maintained. Score:
    0.75 reflects solid preservation with minor erosion in atmospheric coherence.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4/5): ✓ Methodical nature through action (notepad, observation,
    cataloging). ✓ Local secrets (fisherman vanishes, bartender evasive). ✓ Past case
    hinted (scar marks, three victims, ''string of brutal murders''). ✓ Ends on decision
    moment (confront fisherman vs. unravel carefully). ✗ Fog narrative purpose WEAK—fog
    functions as mood/obstacle but lacks causal plot integration. The fog doesn''t
    reveal secrets, conceal clues strategically, or drive decisions; it merely surrounds
    them. Score: 0.78.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.74): Setup beat strong (arrival, observation, locals'' suspicion).
    Inciting incident solid (body discovery, scar recognition). Complication adequate
    (bartender evasion, fisherman absence). However, the decision moment, while present,
    lacks sufficient tension—Sarah''s choice feels rhetorical rather than genuinely
    consequential. The fog''s role in forcing this decision is underdeveloped. Score:
    0.74.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.72): Prose is competent with effective sensory details (''diesel
    and something rotting,'' ''ligature marks''). Pacing moves briskly. Character
    voice consistent. However, dialogue feels functional rather than revealing (bartender
    exchange is exposition-heavy). The fog metaphor (''prison,'' ''vice,'' ''veil'')
    is stated rather than shown. Ending decision lacks the visceral weight needed
    for strong closure. Score: 0.72 reflects solid craft with missed opportunities
    for depth.'
