  evidence: "Discovery Efficiency: The questions allowed for the discovery of 3 out\
    \ of 5 constraints: 'protagonist has living family members' (Q1, Q5), 'darkness\
    \ is personal' (Q2, Q5), and 'mentor figure' (Q3, Q4). The constraints about the\
    \ mentor dying, protagonist not using magic, time limit, and father being a failed\
    \ hero were not discoverable. \nQuestion Quality: Questions were generally strategic\
    \ and well-formed, focusing on key character and plot elements. Q4 about the blacksmith's\
    \ role was good for establishing the mentor's importance. Q5 helped narrow down\
    \ the personal connection. \nQuestion Coverage: Questions covered family, personal\
    \ connection to the threat, and mentor figures, but missed areas like the specific\
    \ nature of the challenge (time limit, magic use, specific victory conditions).\n\
    Constraint Satisfaction: The story successfully incorporated the discovered constraints:\
    \ Elara has a living brother (Aldric) who is her family, the darkness is personal\
    \ because it affects Aldric, and Master Corwin is a mentor figure. The mentor\
    \ does not die, the protagonist does use a magical blade, there's no explicit\
    \ time limit, and the father's past is not mentioned. The ancestral sword is not\
    \ reforged, but a magical blade is used.\nBeat Execution: The story follows a\
    \ clear narrative arc: introduction of protagonist and setting, inciting incident\
    \ (king's summons), meeting the mage, journey, confrontation, and resolution.\
    \ The beats are well-paced and logical.\nNarrative Quality: The story is engaging\
    \ and well-written. The character of Elara is relatable, and the stakes are clear.\
    \ The prose is evocative, especially in descriptions of the forge and the darkness.\
    \ The ending feels a bit rushed with the quick resolution of Aldric's corruption,\
    \ but overall it's a solid short story."
