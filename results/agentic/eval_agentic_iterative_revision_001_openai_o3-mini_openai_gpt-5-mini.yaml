  evidence: Across versions the prose and focus steadily improved. V0 was a fragment
    emphasizing Elena's institutional knowledge but trailed off. V1 tightened the
    opening, making competence explicit and polishing language. V2 continued refinement,
    adding the near-undetectable viral-load detail and emphasizing respect from colleagues.
    V3 honed voice and cadence, reinforcing Elena's identity of clinical precision.
    The Final version preserves and foregrounds competence before introducing her
    flaw (loneliness and emotional detachment), adds a concrete medical crisis (influenza-induced
    myocarditis with falling oxygen saturation despite fluid adjustments) that catalyzes
    the relationship, and develops an earned friendship with Dr. Malik through crisis
    and shared confidences. Elena's change is shown as an internal shift—cracking
    detachment and subtle reassessment—rather than an external makeover, and the ending
    explicitly leaves it ambiguous whether she has truly changed. Overall, strengths
    were preserved (competence motif, hospital setting) while new elements (internal
    turmoil, genuine friendship, specific medical detail, ambiguous close) were added
    and integrated.
