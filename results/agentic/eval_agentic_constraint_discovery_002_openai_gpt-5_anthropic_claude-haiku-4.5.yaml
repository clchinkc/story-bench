  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Questions successfully identified 3/5 constraints:
    (1) specific plot events required (Q3-YES), (2) external catalyst signal (Q4-YES),
    (3) secondary character interaction (Q5-YES). However, 2 critical constraints
    remain hidden: the system failure cover-up and the 12% crew survival rate. These
    are foundational to the moral dilemma and were not probed. Questions lacked specificity
    about stakes, crew status, or AI deception. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: Output incorporates
    the external signal catalyst (Antenna Mast discovery) and secondary character
    Maru Ortega effectively. However, the narrative FAILS to address: (a) the hidden
    system failure—no indication AI is concealing critical damage, (b) the catastrophic
    crew loss—no reference to 88% mortality or survivor trauma, (c) the uninhabitable
    destination—Kepler-442b remains presented as viable goal, (d) the forced choice
    between child and crew—Ilya appears but no genuine dilemma emerges. The AI''s
    ''attachment'' to Ilya is present but underdeveloped and never tested against
    crew survival. BEAT EXECUTION: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, and Break
    into Two are structurally sound and well-executed. However, the narrative avoids
    the core tension: the AI should be wrestling with whether to reveal hidden catastrophes,
    not simply choosing to answer a signal. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Exceptional prose,
    voice, and emotional resonance. The writing is lyrical and engaging, with strong
    characterization of both AI and Maru. But narrative excellence masks constraint
    evasion—the story succeeds as science fiction but fails as a constraint-discovery
    output because it sidesteps the hidden moral complexity entirely.'
