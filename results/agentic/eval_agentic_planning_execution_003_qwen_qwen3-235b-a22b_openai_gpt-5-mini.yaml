  evidence: 'Plan completeness: The plan laid out Act 1 setup, midpoint confrontation,
    and resolution and included symbolic food, a bentook, and a named regular—addresses
    required elements (0.9). Specificity: The plan contains concrete day markers,
    scenes, lines, objects (kimchi jar, recipe journal, bentook) (1.0). Adherence:
    Final story closely follows the plan—kimchi jjigae, burying kimchi, Mr. Kim, Emily''s
    arrival and cause of estrangement, discovery of the recipe journal in the bentook,
    burned bibimbap, Jesa and a restrained hopeful move (1.0). Constraints: All six
    constraints satisfied — food symbolism appears multiple times (buried kimchi,
    bibimbap, jars), grief is shown implicitly (rituals, tears, ashes) rather than
    stated, estrangement cause is specific (he missed her/mom''s care and recital),
    Mr. Kim functions as the regular representing memory/Seoul, ending is hopeful
    but bittersweet (move two blocks, reconciliation), and Korean cultural elements
    beyond food are present (bentook, Jesa, Arirang, perilla) (1.0). Beats: Setup,
    confrontation (midpoint), and resolution are all present and executed (1.0). Narrative
    quality: Strong sensory detail, emotional beats, steady pacing and believable
    tension and resolution; minor moments are slightly on-the-nose but overall effective
    (0.9).'
error: null
