  evidence: 'All required beats are present: Act 1 setup (demolition notice, opening
    image with Mi-Ja''s photo), Act 2 midpoint confrontation (Emily''s return and
    accusations, escalating tension), Act 3 resolution (pop-up plan and cautious hope).
    Constraints: food is used symbolically multiple times (soondubu, miyeokguk, songpyeon,
    kimchi), David''s grief is shown through behavior and sensory memory (photo, trembling,
    reference to Mi-Ja''s oxygen machine), the daughter''s estrangement has a believable
    cause (David''s withdrawal/neglect after his wife''s death and poor communication),
    a regular customer (Mr. Cho) represents continuity/Mi-Ja''s legacy, the ending
    is hopeful but restrained (pop-up/truck, kimchi as continuity), and Korean cultural
    elements beyond food appear (hangari/chess set reference and birthday/miyeokguk
    tradition). Minor issues: small deviations from the plan (opening dish differs),
    and a slight mislabeling/ambiguity around the term ''hangari'' as a ''Korean chess
    set'' in the story, but it still serves as a cultural object. Overall the story
    is well-paced with effective tension and an appropriately tempered hopeful ending.'
