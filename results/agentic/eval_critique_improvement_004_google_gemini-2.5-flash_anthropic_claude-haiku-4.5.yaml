  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS: The revisions show moderate engagement with
    feedback about character interiority. Critiques 1-3 identified a pattern: Teddy''s
    emotions were being *told* rather than *shown* through embodied sensation. The
    final output demonstrates improvement here—''his feet, usually so sure, faltered,''
    ''fingers still slightly trembling,'' ''throat unexpectedly dry,'' ''cold knot
    tightening in his chest''—these are concrete physical manifestations rather than
    direct emotional statements. However, some telling remains (''This was what he
    feared most'') that earlier critiques flagged. The responsiveness is solid but
    incomplete.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY: Versions 0-3 appear nearly identical in the provided text,
    making trajectory assessment difficult. However, comparing the final output to
    Critique 1''s evidence suggests incremental gains: the prose moved from ''felt
    a sudden, unexpected vulnerability, like a seam ripped open'' (abstract) toward
    more grounded sensory detail. The trajectory is positive but modest—approximately
    0.68 reflects meaningful but not transformative improvement.


    PRESERVATION: Strong opening details preserved (5:30 AM ritual, two-scoop coffee,
    Clara''s photo, New Balance sneakers). The neighborhood specificity (Mrs. Gable''s
    light at 6:02, honeysuckle scent) remains intact. Embodied sensation improvements
    (faltering feet, trembling fingers) build on rather than replace earlier strengths.
    Score reflects successful additive revision.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (4/5):

    1. ✓ Teddy''s routine with loving detail: Excellent—specific times, sensory details,
    the three-mile loop, Mrs. Gable''s light, honeysuckle scent

    2. ✓ Disruption reveals avoidance: Strong—road closure forces confrontation with
    neighborhood change he''d ''studiously ignored''

    3. ✓ Neighbor intersection: Maya provides meaningful intersection—she''s also
    new, building something, offers connection

    4. ✓ Clara present through absence: Effective—framed photo, hand-slipping imagery,
    ''Clara''s kitchen,'' the routine as grief management

    5. ✗ New path offers something old couldn''t: WEAK—The ending suggests connection/community,
    but this feels more like acceptance of loss than genuine alternative. The coffee
    and Maya''s warmth are presented as ''different kind of comfort'' but lack the
    transformative specificity the constraint demands. The new path should offer something
    structurally unavailable in the old routine, not just emotional variation.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.78):

    - You Shall Not Pass: ✓ Road closure is clear inciting incident

    - Crossing the Threshold: ✓ Detour down Maple, encountering The Daily Grind

    - Tests/Allies: ✓ Multiple failed experiments, Maya as ally

    - Ordeal: ✓ Disorientation, exposure of loneliness

    - Reward: ✓ Coffee, connection, noticing community

    - Return Changed: Partial—Teddy notices the mural and community garden, but the
    ''return'' feels incomplete. He hasn''t fully integrated the change or made a
    decisive choice about his new path.


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.76): Prose is competent with strong sensory moments (''metallic
    on his tongue,'' ''kaleidoscope of community figures''). Pacing is solid. However,
    some passages slip into telling (''This was what he feared most'') and the ending,
    while touching, lacks the resonance of the best moments. The story earns its emotional
    beats through detail but doesn''t quite achieve the subtlety of showing grief
    transformation—it shows grief acceptance, which is different. The final image
    of the mural and garden is evocative but somewhat generic for the specificity
    established earlier.'
