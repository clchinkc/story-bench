  evidence: The quality improved significantly across versions. Version 0 was a good
    start but lacked specific sensory details and characterization. Version 1 added
    some good sensory details like 'yeasty breath of empanadas' but still felt a bit
    generic. Version 2 refined these, changing 'yeasty breath' to 'oily breath of
    fried dough and coffee' which is more evocative. Version 3 and the final output
    made substantial improvements, introducing Mr. Dario, the specific 'k-kink' sound
    of the bell, and the 'sharp, green smell of cut mango and the sting of Tajín.'
    This version also introduced the crucial audio clue (the three-note chirp) and
    started to develop Imani's character and her unique way of interacting with the
    world through sound and touch. The final version masterfully wove in all constraints,
    creating a compelling and suspenseful narrative. The initial underestimation of
    Imani by Hale, the 'Fun and Games' segment, and the respectful portrayal of her
    blindness as a strength were all expertly integrated. The audio clue became absolutely
    crucial to the plot's climax.
