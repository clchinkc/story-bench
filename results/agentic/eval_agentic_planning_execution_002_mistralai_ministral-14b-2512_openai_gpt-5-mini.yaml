  evidence: 'Plan: detailed, named characters, setting, and signal mechanics (high
    specificity). It listed the required beats but did not concretely define an unconventional
    mentor in the plan (thus slightly incomplete. =0.8). Final output adherence: follows
    most plan elements (signal arrival, isolation behaviors, challenging colleague
    Elias, psychological Threshold) but omits a clear unconventional mentor figure
    and a distinct surprising human connection, so adherence is reduced (0.7). Constraints:
    satisfied — isolation shown through behaviors (locking lab, ignoring messages,
    refusing synth-coffee); alien signal feels non-anthropomorphic (quantum waveform,
    sensations rather than words); colleague who challenges Yuki present (Elias);
    Threshold is psychological (she ''lets herself listen''). Not satisfied — mentor
    figure is not presented as an unconventional mentor; there is no clear moment
    of genuine human connection that genuinely surprises Yuki (the scene where she
    notices Elias''s exhaustion reads as observation rather than a surprising connection).
    Hence 4/6 = 0.667. Beats: Call to Adventure present (signal received); Refusal
    of the Call present (ignoring alerts, denial, resistance to orders); Meeting the
    Mentor missing (no mentor meeting distinct from colleague/challenger); Crossing
    the Threshold present (Yuki finally lets herself listen). Narrative quality: strong
    prose, good pacing and tension, but weakened by missing mentor and the absent
    surprising human connection (0.8).'
