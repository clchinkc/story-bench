  evidence: The initial versions were very similar, focusing on minor word changes.
    However, the final version shows significant improvement in 'youth_voice' by incorporating
    more authentic 12-year-old phrasing and internal thoughts, directly addressing
    the feedback from the critiques. The core strengths identified in the critiques
    (e.g., 'happy-click thing', 'squirmy fish feeling') were retained and built upon.
    The narrative quality improved by making Zara's voice more distinct and her motivations
    clearer, while also effectively introducing the mentor and the initial dismissal.
    The constraints were all met, with Zara's ingenuity (Mist Sipper), the adult dismissal
    ('just a kid'), the mentor's flaw (leaving people behind), and the real danger
    (old streets making currents like fists) all clearly present.
