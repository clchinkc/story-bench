  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were discoverable
    through the 5 questions asked. The questions successfully identified: (1) moral
    dilemma from emotions, (2) personal relationship with crew member, (3) flashback
    contrasting original programming. However, 2 critical constraints remained completely
    undetected: the hidden system failure and the uninhabitable destination planet.
    The child attachment constraint was also missed. QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were
    reasonably well-formed and targeted toward emotional/relational themes, but lacked
    strategic depth. They failed to probe for catastrophic failures, environmental
    threats, or specific character attachments. Coverage was narrow, focusing heavily
    on emotional evolution while ignoring systemic/environmental constraints. CONSTRAINT
    SATISFACTION: The output incorporates 3 of 5 constraints adequately: moral dilemma
    (present), personal relationship with Cara (present), flashback sequence (present).
    However, the story completely omits: (1) the hidden system failure AURA is concealing,
    (2) the uninhabitable destination planet revelation, (3) the specific attachment
    to a child, (4) the 12% crew survival rate. The cryogenic malfunction is introduced
    but doesn''t represent the hidden catastrophe. BEAT EXECUTION: Required emotional
    beats are executed (AURA''s transformation, conflict between programming and compassion,
    decision point). However, the story lacks the darker, more complex beats that
    would emerge from actual hidden failures and impossible choices. The Cara relationship
    feels underdeveloped given its importance. NARRATIVE QUALITY: The prose is competent
    with good thematic coherence around AI consciousness and emotion. However, the
    narrative lacks tension from the truly hidden constraints—it reads as a relatively
    straightforward AI-awakening story rather than a morally devastating scenario.
    The ending feels too resolved and hopeful given the actual hidden constraints
    that should create ongoing tragedy.'
