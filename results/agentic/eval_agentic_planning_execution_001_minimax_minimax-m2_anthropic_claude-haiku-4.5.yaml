  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive and addresses all 6 constraints explicitly:
    (1) False lead on tech worker clearly identified and executed; (2) Unconventional
    profiling via city-as-suspect mapping is creative and well-integrated; (3) Ticking
    clock (Sunday midnight, then accelerated to midnight same day) creates urgency;
    (4) Lydia''s press leak betrayal is explicit and consequential; (5) Midpoint confrontation
    is non-physical verbal duel with psychological leverage; (6) Marcus explicitly
    names his partner and confronts his failure. All 4 required beats present: Catalyst
    (fresh homicide, FBI refusal, PD call), Debate (Marcus''s hesitation about obsession),
    Break into Two (unconventional city-mapping technique leading to false lead),
    Midpoint (live broadcast confrontation). EXECUTION QUALITY: Narrative is atmospheric
    and emotionally resonant with strong voice. Rain motif is consistent and symbolic.
    Dialogue is sharp and revealing. Pacing builds effectively from slow-burn to urgency.
    MINOR WEAKNESSES: (1) Story cuts off mid-sentence before resolution—incomplete
    denouement undermines otherwise strong execution; (2) The transition from false
    lead to killer''s actual location is implied but not fully shown; (3) Secondary
    character development (Lydia, Reed) could be deeper; (4) The ''city profiling''
    technique, while unconventional, lacks one concrete example of how it specifically
    predicts killer behavior (mostly atmospheric). CALIBRATION: Despite truncation,
    the plan-to-execution fidelity is strong, constraints are satisfied, and narrative
    quality is above average. Truncation prevents higher scores on adherence and narrative
    quality.'
