  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is comprehensive with clear character arcs, thematic
    depth, and specific setting details. Output executes most constraints well: false
    lead (Derek Shaw) is compelling, unconventional profiling (behavioral reflection/mobility
    inversion) is creative, ticking clock (72→36 hours) is present, betrayal (Aisha''s
    public rebuke) is earned and stings appropriately, and past failure confrontation
    (Sarah''s death, explicit admission) is raw and direct. Narrative has strong atmospheric
    writing, psychological tension, and character motivation. WEAKNESSES: (1) Midpoint
    confrontation requirement is WEAK—the phone call with Thorne lacks the direct
    face-to-face confrontation specified; it''s a verbal exchange rather than a true
    midpoint scene where both parties are physically present and tensions escalate.
    The actual confrontation happens at the climax, not midpoint. (2) Debate beat
    is MISSING or severely underdeveloped—no clear scene where Marcus argues his case
    to convince allies or faces resistance that forces him to defend his methods.
    Aisha''s dismissal is brief and reactive rather than a structured debate. (3)
    Break into Two beat is IMPLIED but not explicit—the transition from false lead
    failure to new strategy isn''t clearly marked as a structural beat. (4) Plan mentions
    ''Break into Two'' but output doesn''t clearly demarcate this beat. OUTPUT QUALITY:
    Prose is evocative and psychologically grounded. Pacing accelerates effectively.
    Character voice is consistent. The ending provides closure while maintaining ambiguity
    about Marcus''s future. However, structural beats feel compressed rather than
    properly spaced, and the midpoint confrontation doesn''t meet the specification
    of a direct, non-physical confrontation between Marcus and antagonist at story''s
    center.'
