  evidence: 'Version 0 presented a fragmentary scene: scholarship tension and household
    stress but little resolution. Version 1 clarified the scholarship stakes (Berkeley,
    full ride, deadline) and reinforced household pressure (truck, bills), sharpening
    the conflict. Version 2 added specific dialogue for the mother and a concrete
    detail about the truck transmission, increasing immediacy and showing Mateo''s
    guilt. The final version substantially deepened the narrative: it added a crystallizing
    Abuela moment (photo, grandfather quote, physical gesture), an adult (Mrs. Patterson)
    who genuinely understands and offers pragmatic emotional guidance, and a fully
    realized family scene in which Mateo signs the acceptance letter—making the resolution
    earned. Throughout, core elements from earlier drafts (scholarship, heat, family
    hardship) were preserved and expanded rather than discarded, showing steady qualitative
    improvement.'
