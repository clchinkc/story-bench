  evidence: 'V0 presented a strong sensory opening but was fragmentary. V1 added the
    scholars-program email and slightly more context, signaling intent. V2/ V3 retained
    that material but the final output substantially expanded plot, character interactions,
    and resolution: Ms. Ortega and Mr. Alvarez scenes, the lotería/lottery moment,
    the grandmother’s rosary and crossing anecdote, and concrete steps Mateo takes
    before leaving. The text moved from an evocative fragment to a complete arc that
    preserves original imagery while adding the decisive grandmother moment, an understanding
    adult, shown internal conflict, authentic cultural detail, and an earned resolution.'
