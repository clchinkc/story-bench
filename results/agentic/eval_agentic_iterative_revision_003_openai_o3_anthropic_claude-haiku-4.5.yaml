  evidence: 'VERSION 0 establishes setting but tells conflict (''avoided the bulletin
    board''). VERSION 1 adds specificity (Lantus, Lirio''s Diner, bilingual detail)
    and shows internal flicker/smothering. VERSION 2 sharpens sensory language (''quivered,''
    ''coughed,'' ''Sparks fired...fizzled'') and introduces the cooler as metaphor.
    VERSION 3 adds the electric bill—concrete obstacle—and refines the opening. FINAL
    OUTPUT fully executes all constraints: (1) Internal conflict shown through physical
    manifestations (knee jittering, stomach clench, ''half-terrified, half-alive'')
    rather than exposition. (2) Grandmother scene crystallizes choice—the nopal metaphor
    (''Guarda agua en silencio, pero también crece espinas'') directly addresses his
    dilemma; her permission (''Let your family carry you'') is the earned permission
    he needed. (3) Abuela genuinely understands—she reads his anxiety (''Tienes hormigas
    en los huesos''), validates both responsibility AND growth, and reframes love
    as reciprocal. (4) Cultural elements feel lived-in: specific medications (Lantus),
    food rituals (frijoles, cumin), language code-switching (Spanglish at robotics),
    norteño music, the truck keys as trust gesture—none feel decorative. (5) Resolution
    earned through growth: Mateo doesn''t abandon family; he learns to accept their
    support (''Let your family carry you, too''), which paradoxically frees him to
    pursue robotics. The final image (two bowls, ''ingeniero'' title) shows integration,
    not escape. Narrative quality strengthened through: sensory precision (creosote
    smell, ember-red solder, rain-wet mesquite eyes), metaphorical coherence (cooler/gate/nopal/water),
    dialogue that reveals character, and a climax that resolves internal conflict
    through relational wisdom rather than individual triumph.'
