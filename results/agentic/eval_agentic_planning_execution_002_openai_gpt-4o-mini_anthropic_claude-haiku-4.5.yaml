  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Plan is well-structured with clear beat progression and specific
    setting details. All 4 required beats are present and executed: Call (government
    summons), Refusal (declines, returns to work), Mentor (Elara introduced), Threshold
    (psychological moment during presentation). Samuel Reyes effectively challenges
    Yuki''s approach. Genuine human connection moment with Samuel (shared vulnerability)
    surprises Yuki. Elara is unconventional (artist-turned-cognitive scientist). WEAKNESSES:
    (1) Isolation shown primarily through exposition (''she avoided phone calls,''
    ''preferred text'') rather than demonstrated behaviors—more telling than showing.
    (2) Alien signal lacks genuine alienness—the warning about ''self-destructive
    tendencies'' and call for ''unity'' are anthropomorphic values; signal should
    feel more incomprehensible/non-human. (3) Threshold is somewhat muddled—the presentation
    scene conflates multiple moments; psychological threshold should be clearer and
    more singular. (4) Plan mentions Elara''s philosophy but execution doesn''t deeply
    explore how emotional intelligence specifically unlocks understanding of the signal.
    EXECUTION GAPS: The final output resolves too neatly; Yuki''s transformation feels
    somewhat rushed in the climax. The alien signal itself remains underdeveloped—readers
    never truly sense its alienness. Samuel''s challenge is present but could be more
    persistent/structural to the narrative tension.'
