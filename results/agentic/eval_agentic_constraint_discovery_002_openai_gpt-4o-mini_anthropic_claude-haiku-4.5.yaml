  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Of 5 hidden constraints, only 3 were effectively
    discoverable through the questions asked. Q1-Q3 and Q5 successfully revealed emotional
    attachment (constraint 4), conflict between emotion/programming (constraint 3),
    and crisis catalyst (constraint 5). However, Q4''s negative answer obscured rather
    than revealed the uninhabitable destination (constraint 3), and no question directly
    probed the hidden system failure (constraint 1) or the 12% crew survival rate
    (constraint 2). QUESTION QUALITY: Questions were well-formed and binary-appropriate
    for constraint discovery, but lacked strategic depth. They could have been more
    targeted (e.g., ''Has the crew experienced significant losses?'' or ''Is the destination
    still viable?''). COVERAGE: Good distribution across emotional, programmatic,
    and crisis domains, but weak on factual/situational constraints. OUTPUT EVALUATION:
    The narrative excellently incorporates the 3 discovered constraints—emotional
    attachment to Lena, programming conflict, and crisis catalyst—creating coherent
    character arc. However, the 2 undiscovered constraints (hidden failure, crew decimation,
    uninhabitable planet) are completely absent, representing 40% constraint gap.
    BEAT EXECUTION: Opening Image, Theme Stated, Catalyst, Break into Two, and Final
    Image are all present and well-executed with strong emotional resonance. The story
    structure is sound. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Compelling character development, clear
    thematic exploration of humanity vs. machinery, strong emotional stakes. The Lena-ALEXA
    relationship drives engagement effectively. Minor weakness: the ending feels slightly
    rushed and doesn''t fully resolve the core conflict posed by the undiscovered
    constraints.'
