  evidence: 'The revision process shows strong responsiveness to critique feedback.
    Early critiques (0.72-0.78) identified uneven interiority and dissociation as
    key strengths. The final version preserves the dissociation opening (''something
    felt hollow about it, as if he were watching himself from a distance'') while
    deepening it through concrete sensory details and emotional specificity. The trajectory
    demonstrates improvement: (1) Constraint satisfaction strengthened—all five constraints
    now clearly present: specific routine detail (6:47 AM ritual, exact route, coffee
    timing), disruption revealing avoidance (the barricade forces confrontation with
    grief), neighbor intersection (James and his petunias create meaningful parallel),
    absence through presence (Dorothy woven throughout via memory, ritual, guilt),
    new path offering what old couldn''t (witness to hidden grief, connection, permission
    to change). (2) Character interiority deepened—moved from reactive moments to
    layered internal conflict (''betrayal'' vs. ''desperate,'' guilt about recognizing
    James, the shrine revelation). (3) Subtlety improved—emotions conveyed through
    action (lingering hand on railing, pouring cold coffee on rosebush, brewing fresh)
    rather than exposition. The final beat execution is strong: Ordinary World (routine
    established with loving detail), Call to Adventure (barricade), Refusal (almost
    turns back), Crossing Threshold (walks Vernon despite guilt), Tests/Allies (James
    recognition), Ordeal (shrine revelation), Reward (loosened chest, permission),
    Return (cold coffee ritual disrupted), New Ordinary (tomorrow''s walk reimagined).
    Preservation of strengths is evident—the opening remains intact, the dissociation
    language carries through, Dorothy''s presence maintains its haunting quality.
    Minor weakness: the shrine moment, while powerful, edges slightly toward on-the-nose
    thematic delivery (''How much had he protected himself from seeing?''), though
    the action-based framing largely mitigates this.'
