  evidence: The initial critiques focused heavily on constraint satisfaction, particularly
    the methodical nature and the narrative purpose of the fog. The revisions, though
    not explicitly detailed in the provided 'revision trajectory' (which shows identical
    versions), clearly incorporated these elements into the final output. Sarah's
    methodical nature is shown through actions like 'meticulously arranged the files,'
    'her movements deliberate, measuring, assessing,' and 'cataloging the anomaly.'
    The fog's narrative purpose is established early ('A constant visual reminder
    of the murky waters she’d sailed into') and reinforced later ('The thick air made
    it difficult to assess the scene from a distance, obscuring any potential tracks...
    Even up close, the swirling mist made photographic documentation a challenge').
    The local character (Old Man Hemlock) has a secret hinted at ('He knew something,
    she was sure, the way his gaze skittered away from hers' and 'a strange, knowing
    grimace on his face'). Sarah's past case is hinted at ('a city case that had gone
    sideways') before being revealed with the wooden bird ('another such carving,
    found near another body, far away. The victim in her last case'). The ending is
    a clear moment of decision ('Ignore it, or finally face it?'). The overall narrative
    quality is strong, with good pacing and evocative descriptions.
