  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS: Versions 0-2 show truncation (incomplete fragments),
    making direct comparison difficult. Version 3 introduces concrete competence demonstration
    (securing supplies, mediating conflicts, colleague admiration) and begins character
    depth. Final output substantially expands this foundation with: (1) explicit competence
    beats before flaw introduction—Elena''s efficiency, problem-solving with Maria''s
    pneumonia diagnosis, professional respect; (2) genuine friendship development
    through reciprocal vulnerability and earned trust over multiple interactions;
    (3) internal transformation shown through Elena''s emotional recognition (''A
    pang twisted inside her'') and behavioral shifts (bedside visits, sharing personal
    loss) rather than external changes; (4) specific medical detail—secondary bacterial
    pneumonia with patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray—that serves plot function (justifies
    Elena''s intervention, demonstrates her knowledge, creates stakes). CONSTRAINT
    GAPS: The ending achieves ambiguity (''Had she opened up? Or would competence
    reclaim its throne?'') but the ambiguity feels somewhat resolved by Elena''s demonstrated
    actions and emotional growth. The question posed is more rhetorical than genuinely
    uncertain—readers likely perceive real change despite the textual hedging. PRESERVATION:
    Strong maintenance of core elements across revisions—hospital setting, flu season
    context, Elena''s initial characterization, the friendship arc structure. RESPONSIVENESS:
    Revisions progressively added specificity (medical details, concrete competence
    examples, dialogue) and emotional depth, though the truncated middle versions
    limit assessment of intentional feedback incorporation. EXECUTION QUALITY: Beats
    are present but unevenly weighted—competence and friendship development are strong;
    the transformation''s internal nature is clear but perhaps slightly over-explained
    through Elena''s direct emotional acknowledgment rather than shown purely through
    behavior.'
  strengths:
  - Competence clearly established before vulnerability revealed
  - Medical detail (secondary bacterial pneumonia, infiltrates) is specific and narratively
    functional
  - Friendship feels earned through reciprocal sharing and time investment
  - Internal transformation prioritized—Elena's emotional recognition and perspective
    shift
  - Atmospheric writing with sensory details (heels clicking, monitors beeping, cold
    sandwich)
  weaknesses:
  - Ending ambiguity is somewhat undermined by Elena's demonstrated emotional growth—the
    question feels rhetorical rather than genuinely open
  - Pacing accelerates in final section; friendship development compressed into 'days
    passed' summary
  - Elena's self-awareness ('She pushed the emptiness down') borders on telling rather
    than showing her internal state
  - Maria's character remains somewhat functional to Elena's arc rather than fully
    realized
  - The transformation, while internal, is perhaps too explicitly articulated ('A
    pang twisted inside her')
  calibration_notes: Constraint satisfaction scored 0.8 (4/5) because genuine ambiguity
    about lasting change is present but weakened by narrative signals of real transformation.
    The story successfully executes most requirements but the ending's uncertainty
    is compromised by Elena's clear emotional journey. Beat execution at 0.75 reflects
    strong competence/friendship beats but slightly rushed transformation sequence.
    Narrative quality at 0.78 acknowledges strong prose and structure offset by pacing
    issues and over-explanation in places.
