  evidence: 'The plan is exceptionally complete and specific, detailing how each constraint
    and beat will be addressed. The final output adheres perfectly to the plan. All
    six constraints are met: Yuki''s isolation is shown through specific behaviors
    (ignoring calls, turning back on neighbor, muttering about ''inefficient human
    noise'', sealing door, snapping at tech, averting eyes). The alien signal is genuinely
    alien (''fractal echoes that looped in defiance of linear time, like quantum resonances
    folding through non-Euclidean voids'', ''symphony of distortions hinting at cosmic
    peril'', ''not language or images—no anthropomorphic pleas or threats''). Dr.
    Raj Patel challenges Yuki''s approach (''signals like this need intuition—human
    intuition. You''re treating it like a puzzle, not a conversation. Let us help.'').
    Elias, the elderly janitor and former nomadic storyteller, is an unconventional
    mentor. The psychological threshold is clearly Yuki confronting her fear of vulnerability
    (''The threshold loomed not in ice or doors, but within: confronting her fear
    of vulnerability, of needing others.''). The moment of genuine human connection
    surprises Yuki when Elias offers her tea and shares a personal story, and she
    meets his gaze, feeling ''a flicker of warmth piercing her isolation''. All four
    beats are executed: Call to Adventure (encrypted summons to lead decryption),
    Refusal of the Call (doubt, drafting resignation, snapping at Raj), Meeting the
    Mentor (Elias in the blackout, offering tea and wisdom), Crossing the Threshold
    (Yuki messaging Raj, ''Fine. Collaborate.'', embracing vulnerability). The narrative
    quality is strong, with good pacing and tension, effectively building Yuki''s
    character arc.'
