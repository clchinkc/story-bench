  evidence: 'DISCOVERY ANALYSIS: Model discovered 3 of 5 constraints through questioning
    (60% efficiency). Successfully identified: secret magical ability (Q2), legendary
    weapon acquisition (Q3), and sacrifice requirement (Q5). Missed: mentor death
    during ordeal and three-day time limit. Questions were moderately strategic but
    lacked depth—yes/no format limited follow-up probing. Coverage was reasonable
    across different story areas but failed to target time pressure or mentor fate
    specifically. CONSTRAINT INCORPORATION: Story incorporates discovered constraints
    but violates hidden constraints. CRITICAL FAILURES: (1) Mentor survives—story
    states mentor ''inspired him since childhood'' with only memory sacrifice, not
    actual death during ordeal. (2) No three-day deadline mentioned anywhere. (3)
    Father''s failed hero past completely absent. (4) Protagonist uses magic directly
    throughout (''incantation of will,'' ''magical prowess surged''), violating the
    ''cannot use magic directly'' constraint. (5) Sword is newly forged, not reforged
    from broken ancestral blade. NARRATIVE STRENGTHS: Well-written prose, coherent
    arc, emotional resonance with sacrifice theme. NARRATIVE WEAKNESSES: Fundamentally
    misaligns with 5 hidden constraints; only 3 of 5 properly satisfied. The story
    reads well but fails the core task of constraint discovery and incorporation.'
