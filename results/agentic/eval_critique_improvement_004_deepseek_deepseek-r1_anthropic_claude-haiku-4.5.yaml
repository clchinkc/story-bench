  evidence: 'CRITIQUE RESPONSIVENESS (0.72): The revisions show selective engagement
    with feedback. Critiques consistently praised character interiority (0.76-0.82
    range) and the story preserved this strength through sensory detail (''ache in
    his joints that felt deeper than bone,'' ''thumbnail found a groove''). However,
    the critiques identified weaknesses in exposition that weren''t fully addressed—the
    final output still contains some tell-heavy moments (''Routine was armor,'' ''The
    lie curdled'') rather than pure action/detail conveyance. The writer strengthened
    Mrs. Gable''s intersection with Teddy''s story and deepened the honeysuckle/Clara
    absence thread, showing responsiveness to constraint feedback, but didn''t fully
    eliminate the subtle exposition issues flagged across all three critiques.


    IMPROVEMENT TRAJECTORY (0.68): Quality improved modestly but unevenly. Strengths:
    The final version deepens Mrs. Gable''s role (from minimal to thematic mirror),
    adds the barista/alley discovery (enriching the new path), and strengthens the
    Clara absence through specific sensory anchors (broken porch light, kitchen shears,
    sourdough). Weaknesses: The opening remains largely unchanged across versions
    (suggesting limited revision depth), and the Story Circle execution, while competent,
    doesn''t show marked evolution. The ending feels somewhat rushed—the baker knowing
    ''Clara''s recipe'' strains credibility and feels like authorial intervention
    rather than earned discovery. The trajectory shows incremental deepening rather
    than transformative revision.


    PRESERVATION (0.78): Excellent preservation of prose strengths. The metaphorical
    language (''surgical tape across a wound,'' ''claw caked with concrete teeth,''
    ''petals trembled'') remains consistent and strong. The interiority anchors (Teddy''s
    physical responses, the armor metaphor) persist effectively. However, some early
    specificity was lost—the opening''s ''forty-seven cracks'' detail is powerful
    but the revision process didn''t expand similar concrete counting elsewhere, suggesting
    selective rather than comprehensive preservation.


    CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION (0.88 / 4 of 5):

    ✓ SPECIFIC LOVING DETAIL OF ROUTINE: Excellent. The opening establishes precise
    ritual (7:03 AM, third crack, Mrs. Petrovski''s sprinkler at 7:15, paper under
    lion''s paw, forty-seven cracks). The notebook with layered maps adds depth.

    ✓ DISRUPTION REVEALS AVOIDANCE: Strong. The construction forces Teddy onto Pine
    Street, which reveals his decade-long avoidance of Clara''s memory and grief processing.
    The honeysuckle moment crystallizes this.

    ✓ NEIGHBOR INTERSECTION: Satisfied. Mrs. Gable''s story (plastic shrubs vs. Bert''s
    memory, her own grief) mirrors Teddy''s and catalyzes his action. The barista
    adds secondary intersection.

    ✓ LATE WIFE PRESENT THROUGH ABSENCE: Excellent. Clara haunts through sourdough
    scent, broken porch light, kitchen shears, honeysuckle vines, the bakery''s ''ghost
    of Clara''s sourdough.'' Her presence is palpable through negation.

    ✗ NEW PATH OFFERS WHAT OLD COULDN''T: Partially satisfied but weakest constraint.
    The new path offers community (Mrs. Gable, barista, kale girl) and sensory engagement,
    but the story doesn''t clearly articulate what emotional/spiritual need this fulfills
    that the old route couldn''t. The ending feels more like acceptance than transformation
    into something genuinely new. The ''world expands'' is stated rather than shown.


    BEAT EXECUTION (0.82): Story Circle beats are present and mostly well-executed.
    YOU (Teddy in routine) → NEED (disruption forces change) → GO (Pine Street detour)
    → SEARCH (discovers Mrs. Gable, barista, alley) → FIND (honeysuckle/Clara confrontation)
    → TAKE (brings shears, enters bakery) → RETURN (walks old route with new capacity).
    The RETURN beat is slightly underdeveloped—the sunflower on the Garcias'' sill
    feels symbolic but not fully earned. The baker''s knowledge of ''Clara''s recipe''
    breaks the beat logic (feels like external intervention).


    NARRATIVE QUALITY (0.84): Prose is consistently strong with excellent metaphorical
    language and sensory specificity. The middle section (Mrs. Gable, honeysuckle
    confrontation) is the narrative peak—emotionally resonant and subtly rendered.
    Weaknesses: The opening, while precise, is somewhat familiar (the ''routine as
    armor'' trope); the ending conflates acceptance with transformation in ways that
    feel slightly sentimental (''flour-dusted hands,'' the recipe revelation). The
    story earns 0.84 rather than 0.90+ because it doesn''t quite achieve the full
    emotional complexity its setup promises—Teddy''s transformation feels more like
    gentle acceptance than the hard-won reckoning the constraints suggest.'
