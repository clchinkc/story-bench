  evidence: The critiques highlighted Teddy's interiority, particularly his dissociation
    and alienation. The revisions, especially from V0 to V1 and subsequent versions,
    consistently deepened this by adding phrases like 'something felt hollow about
    it, as if he were watching himself from a distance' and 'The landmark felt like
    visiting a museum of himself.' The final version successfully integrates these
    elements, showing Teddy's internal struggle and gradual shift. Strengths like
    the specific routine and the presence of Dorothy through absence were maintained
    and enhanced. The narrative quality improved significantly, becoming more emotionally
    resonant and detailed.
