  evidence: 'Versions 0–2 are essentially identical (little to no change), so there
    was no early iterative improvement. Version 3 tightened phrasing and established
    Elena''s emotional state more clearly. The final output substantially expanded
    the scene: it adds a concrete crisis (code blue in the ICU), a specific medical
    detail (oxygen saturations rising from 88% to 94%), repeated, believable acts
    of kindness from Marta (bringing broth across multiple nights), and gradual, internal
    shifts in Elena (from feeling indispensable to wondering about her loneliness).
    The core opening competence paragraph was preserved throughout; the later revisions
    layered interpersonal moments and internal reflection, producing a clear qualitative
    jump between v2/v3 and the final version.'
