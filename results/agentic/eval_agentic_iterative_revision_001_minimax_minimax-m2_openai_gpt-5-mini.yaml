  evidence: Version 0 established Elena's clinical competence but cut off mid-paragraph
    and lacked relational development. Version 1 tightened the opening and emphasized
    'Respected. Efficient. Alone.' but still left the emotional arc undeveloped. Version
    2 preserved the competence lines and reintroduced the internal cue ('Her competence
    was a shield...') preparing for expansion. The final version expands the interiority
    and adds concrete events and medical details (teen with viral pneumonia, oseltamivir,
    SpO₂ 92, transport ventilator, prone positioning), introduces Aisha with believable,
    incremental bonding (supply-closet talks, exchanged skills, shared coffee, community
    fair), and leaves the ending ambiguous about whether Elena has truly changed.
    Overall quality improved substantially across iterations while preserving the
    strongest original elements (competence imagery and hospital atmosphere).
