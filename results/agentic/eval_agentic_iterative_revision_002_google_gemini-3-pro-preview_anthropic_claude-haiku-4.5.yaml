  evidence: 'TRAJECTORY: Versions 0→1 added tactile specificity (Braille display,
    server hum) replacing vague ''darkness as canvas.'' V1→2 enriched sensory palette
    (diesel fumes, fermenting citrus) and introduced audio waveform visualization.
    V2→3 elevated language (''velvet silence,'' ''frantic pistons'') and deepened
    Imani''s technical competence. Final output maintains all gains while adding narrative
    momentum and character depth. CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION: (1) Non-visual sensory
    details PROMINENT—humidity descriptions evolve from generic to specific (wet wool,
    fermenting citrus, churro grease); tactile Braille display; olfactory bodega scene;
    auditory waveforms dominate narrative. (2) Blindness as STRENGTH—Imani''s audio
    pattern recognition outperforms sighted detective; her sonic fingerprinting is
    investigative superpower; she navigates independently; no pity framing. (3) AUDIO
    CLUE crucial—''Click-scrape'' heel plate becomes both plot catalyst AND climactic
    threat; it''s the sonic fingerprint that identifies the killer and the sound that
    saves her life through recognition. (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION—Detective Miller
    explicitly condescends (''you didn''t SEE a crime''), dismisses her as ''just
    a podcaster,'' uses slow-paced tone reserved for disabled people; Imani dismantles
    this through demonstration. (5) FUN AND GAMES ENTERTAINING BEFORE DARK—Bodega
    scene is genuinely engaging: witty banter, Imani''s clever verbal sparring, her
    humorous deconstruction of Miller''s tells (pen clicking in 4/4 time), light tone
    maintained through ''I have the truth, Miller. You just have to open your ears.''
    Then immediate tonal shift: ''But the game ended as soon as she left the shop.''
    BEAT EXECUTION: Opening Image (soundproofed closet workspace) ✓; Catalyst (jagged
    waveform spike) ✓; Fun and Games (bodega investigation) ✓; Midpoint transition
    (realization killer is following) ✓; Climax setup (click-scrape approaching) ✓.
    Minor gap: No explicit B-story or relationship subplot, though Miller serves as
    antagonistic mirror. NARRATIVE QUALITY: Prose is sophisticated and precise. Sensory
    language escalates purposefully. Dialogue reveals character through speech patterns.
    Pacing accelerates appropriately. The final paragraph''s tension is earned through
    earlier setup. Imani''s voice is distinctive and authoritative. The twist—that
    the killer recognized her from the recording—adds thematic resonance about visibility
    and vulnerability.'
