  evidence: 'VERSION 1 established strong sensory foundation (humidity, audio frequencies)
    but remained abstract. VERSION 2 added specificity (bakery smell, sweat sensation)
    and introduced Imani''s professional context, grounding her character. FINAL OUTPUT
    synthesizes both while dramatically elevating execution: (1) NON-VISUAL SENSORY
    DETAILS: Exceptional progression from generic ''humidity'' to layered olfactory/tactile
    specificity (asphalt, yeast, sweat-as-insect). Maintained throughout final output.
    (2) BLINDNESS AS STRENGTH: V1-V2 implied this; final version makes it explicit
    and central to narrative—Imani''s audio isolation skills directly outperform sighted
    detective''s visual-dependent methods. This is portrayed as genuine professional
    advantage, not inspiration porn. (3) AUDIO CLUE: V1 introduced ''click-h...''
    fragment; V2-Final developed into sophisticated audio forensics (click-drag pattern,
    ball bearing, deviated septum whistle). The specific audio signature becomes the
    plot engine. (4) CHARACTER UNDERESTIMATION: Miller''s dismissal (''you''re hearing
    what you want to hear because you can''t see'') is direct, respectful, and creates
    genuine tension. His silence after the reveal is earned. (5) FUN AND GAMES ENTERTAINMENT:
    V1 lacked this beat entirely. V2 sketched it. Final version executes brilliantly—the
    layer-by-layer audio isolation is genuinely engaging (technical mastery + personality),
    with Imani''s ''sharp, dangerous expression'' and narrative control creating entertainment
    before the darker implications emerge (perp identification, potential danger).
    BEAT STRUCTURE: Opening Image (strong), Catalyst (clear), Fun and Games (well-executed
    but truncated—Miller''s response cut off). Truncation prevents full assessment
    of tonal shift to darkness. MINOR GAPS: (1) Fun and Games section ends mid-sentence,
    preventing evaluation of dark turn completion. (2) Imani''s vulnerability/stakes
    not yet established—we see competence but not what''s at risk. (3) Respectful
    portrayal is excellent but could deepen beyond ''strength'' to show complexity
    (fatigue mentioned but underdeveloped). STRENGTHS: Sensory writing is sophisticated
    and consistent. Imani''s voice is distinctive and authoritative. The audio forensics
    concept is original and well-researched-feeling. Constraint integration is seamless,
    not forced.'
