output: 'The bitter dregs of black coffee sat cold on Detective Rachel Torres’s desk,
  ignored in favor of the manila folder spread before her. It was a Tuesday morning
  in October, the low hum of a jazz station drifting from the precinct radio, but
  Rachel only had ears for the silence in a twelve-year-old homicide photo. She tapped
  a rhythm on the desk, her mind retracing steps she’d walked a thousand times in
  her career.


  “You’re still chasing the Riverside Strangler,” Detective James Oyelaran said, sliding
  a chair over. He placed a steaming cup on the corner of her desk, well away from
  the paperwork.


  “Someone has to,” she muttered, finally looking up.


  After three years of riding together, James didn''t push; he just sipped his own
  coffee and waited. Theirs was a silent language, built on long nights and shared
  hunches. Rachel glanced at her phone to check the time, pausing on the background
  photo: her calico, Sherlock, draped over the couch in her small Queens apartment.
  She’d rescued the cat from a raid two years ago, pulling him from a drug dealer’s
  closet. He was the only roommate she tolerated since the engagement fell apart.


  “Neighborhood watch reports are up,” James noted, tapping a stack of new files.
  “Property crimes spiking in the wealthy sectors.”


  “Economic pressure,” Rachel dismissed, closing the cold case file. The status quo
  at the Riverside Precinct was stable, but the tension was rising. “What’s the priority
  today?”


  “We have a fresh body.”'
