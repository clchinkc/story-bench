  They took his biometrics in a white alcove that smelled faintly of iodine and machine
  oil, then routed him through a corridor where the gravity wavered like a thought
  trying to settle. Screens along the wall looped the Collective’s one rule—NO EXTRADITION—beneath
  a scrolling list of others that were not called rules at all: resource shares, work
  credits, arbitration queues, the current air debt for Ring Sector Nine. The elevator
  badge at his collar was replaced with a plain polymer tag that read JIN / TEMPORARY
  / SPONSORED: NONE.


  “Unattached,” a clerk said without looking up, as if reading weather. “You can’t
  rent a bunk or access the mesh at full bandwidth. You can apply for sponsorship
  or take a public cot in Dock Commons. Next.”


  Jin’s throat tightened. On Earth, he’d been hunted by governments. Here, he was
  simply unfiled.


  Dock Commons was a long, bright cylinder where people slept in shifts on fabric
  slings. A row of recyclers hummed, breaking down yesterday’s meals into tomorrow’s
  nutrient paste. No one asked why he’d come; everyone watched the tag at his chest
  and calculated what kind of trouble had arrived with him. He tried to pay for water
  and learned his Earth accounts meant nothing. A woman with grease-darkened hands
  laughed softly and slid her own ration chip over the scanner.


  “First day’s free,” she said. “Second costs you pride.”


  He slept badly, waking to announcements about arbitration elections and a public
  hearing on “Earth entanglement risk.” The Collective wasn’t one station; it was
  a quarrel held together by shared vacuum. Syndicates argued with Assemblies argued
  with Mutuals, each claiming to be the real spine of independence. In the mess line,
  he heard his name once, spoken like an inconvenience. Someone had already posted
  the Council’s warrant in a forum thread titled IMPORTED PROBLEM.


  He spent the next day searching for purchase, the way he used to scan a lab bench
  for a missing tool. He needed a terminal, an account, a place to work. He needed,
  if not allies, at least a corner that would not shove him back down the tether.


  At a public kiosk, he queued behind a courier and a child spinning in microgravity.
  When it was his turn, the screen refused him half the functions.


  “Unattached,” it flashed again.


  “Temporary access,” he tried, and a new window opened: APPLY FOR SPONSORSHIP. LIST
  YOUR CONTRIBUTION.


  Contribution. The Collective’s currency was usefulness, and usefulness was politics.


  He found the Open Works bay by following the smell of coolant and the sound of arguments.
  A ring of fabrication benches surrounded a mesh of improvised desks. Posters on
  the bulkheads declared DATA IS AIR and NOTHING IS FREE IN A CLOSED SYSTEM. A man
  with silver hair pulled back in a loop sat at a terminal that looked older than
  most of the station. He was watching a vote tally crawl across the screen, expression
  unreadable.


  Jin hovered until the man glanced up.


  “You’re the leak,” the man said, not accusing, just naming. “I’m Sato. I keep the
  Archive and teach newcomers how not to suffocate on procedure.”


  “Sato,” Jin repeated, relief and caution arriving together. “I need a platform.
  I need to keep the evidence alive.”


  Sato nodded toward the benches. “Platform is a word Earth people love. Here it’s
  ‘slot.’ You want a slot, you trade something. You can trade labor, patents, or a
  story that makes someone look righteous.”


  “I don’t want to make anyone—”


  “You already did,” Sato said gently. “The Council made you a symbol. The Collective
  will do the same, unless you learn to steer.”


  Over hours, Sato translated the station’s etiquette the way one might translate
  a dangerous poem. The Mutuals would shelter him if he agreed to publish through
  their channels and submit to their review board. The Syndicates would give him mesh
  bandwidth if he took a public stance against “Earth pollution,” which sometimes
  meant refusing to share anything that could benefit the planet. The Assembly would
  offer him legitimacy but only after a months-long citizenship audit that would freeze
  his access in the meantime.


  Jin’s instincts kept reaching for the old straightforward line: truth out, pressure
  on, change inevitable. Sato kept interrupting with small, unforgiving questions.
  Who pays for the servers that host truth? Who breathes the air while you wait for
  inevitable? How much bandwidth does conscience require?


  Late in the cycle, Sato pulled up the suppressed carbon capture files Jin had carried
  in fragments, cached in redundant blocks. “Show me what they were afraid of,” he
  said.


  Jin walked him through the mechanism—electrochemical lattices that could bind CO₂
  at scale, then release it for sequestration with minimal energy input. Sato listened,
  then leaned closer, eyes narrowing at a materials table embedded in the appendices.


  “This catalyst,” Sato murmured. “You thought it was standard?”


  “It’s listed as a ‘stabilized iridium composite,’” Jin said. “Expensive, but—”


  “It isn’t iridium,” Sato said, fingers moving fast, cross-referencing with a mining
  manifest. “It’s doped with helium-3 residues. That means it’s processed off-world.
  Lunar, maybe. Or from the same asteroids the Council’s partners have contracts on.”


  Jin stared at the lines until they blurred into something colder than numbers. The
  breakthrough hadn’t been suppressed only to protect fossil interests; it was also
  a gate. Anyone who controlled the catalyst supply controlled the cure.


  “Even if Earth had the design,” Jin whispered, “they’d still be dependent.”


  “Dependence is policy,” Sato said. “Not an accident.”


  The next day, Sato brought him to a Mutuals hearing chamber—a curved room where
  representatives sat in a semi-circle, each with a breathing mask clipped to their
  collar like a reminder. They offered Jin sponsorship: a bunk, full mesh access,
  lab time in Open Works, and a channel to broadcast his findings across the Collective.
  In exchange, they wanted exclusive first release of any new analyses, and they wanted
  the catalyst section framed as proof of Earth’s corruption rather than a problem
  of supply chains the Collective might also exploit.


  Jin felt the room’s sealed atmosphere, the way every inhale belonged partly to others.
  He could refuse and remain unattached, his data rotting in partial access while
  the Council rewrote the narrative on Earth. He could accept and become, immediately,
  someone else’s instrument.


  He looked at Sato, hoping for permission to stay pure. Sato only watched him, as
  if teaching by withholding.


  Jin made his choice with a dryness in his mouth that felt like grief. “I’ll sign,”
  he said. “But I keep the raw data in the Archive under shared keys. No edits. No
  deletions.”


  Murmurs. A compromise inside a compromise.


  They agreed, after an hour of bargaining that left Jin sweating in recycled air.
  His tag updated on the spot: SPONSORED: MUTUALS / PROBATIONARY. The mesh unfurled,
  suddenly wide enough to breathe in. Messages queued for him—requests, accusations,
  invitations to panels he hadn’t earned. A bunk assignment pinged. A lab slot opened
  in Open Works.


  That night, alone in a narrow berth that was finally his, Jin drafted the first
  Mutuals bulletin. He wrote the truth as far as he could, and then—because he had
  promised sponsorship, because he needed the channel—he trimmed the catalyst revelation
  into a pointed insinuation rather than a full map of off-world dependence. He told
  himself it was temporary, a way to get footing, to keep the larger story alive.


  When he hit send, the bulletin propagated through the Collective’s feeds, his name
  attached to a cause that would now carry him.


  He had gained air, bandwidth, and a place to work.


  He had paid with the shape of his own honesty, and the knowledge that the first
  lie he told in orbit was to people who had offered him sanctuary.'
