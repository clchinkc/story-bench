output: "The roar of Formula One engines masked the click of Miri's lockpicks perfectly.\
  \ She knelt before the mahogany panel in Sorokin's private gallery, her scarlet\
  \ cocktail dress pooling around her knees while Monaco's elite clinked champagne\
  \ glasses one deck above. Through her earpiece, Jules—her tech specialist and the\
  \ closest thing she had to a friend—narrated the Grand Prix's final laps with timing\
  \ precision.\n\n\"Verstappen's got twelve seconds on the field. You've got four\
  \ minutes before yacht security does their rotation.\"\n\n\"More than enough.\"\
  \ The panel swung open. Behind climate-controlled glass hung \"The Musician's Daughter\"\
  —a Vermeer study that had vanished from Amsterdam in 1943. The daughter in question\
  \ had been Sarah Liebermann, age eight, who'd watched the Nazis carry it away. Sarah\
  \ was seventy-nine now, and Miri had promised her grandson they'd bring it home.\n\
  \nAbove deck, her crew played their parts beautifully. Dmitri, her charming forger,\
  \ had the yacht's first officer engrossed in a debate about maritime law. Chen,\
  \ posing as a caterer, had mapped every guard rotation. Even the Grand Prix itself\
  \ was part of the plan—who monitored security cameras when Ferrari and Mercedes\
  \ battled meters from your stern?\n\nMiri photographed the frame's alarm contacts,\
  \ then texted Jules. Ninety seconds later, the system showed green. \"Clean loop\
  \ running,\" Jules confirmed. \"But Miri, the yacht's manifest shows they upgraded\
  \ the fire suppression system last week. Halon gas in all sealed rooms. If someone\
  \ triggers it manually—\"\n\n\"Why would they? We're ghosts.\" Miri lifted the painting\
  \ free. Lighter than expected. Behind it, the wall safe beckoned.\n\n\"Company,\"\
  \ Chen's voice crackled. \"New player. Fifties, French accent, very interested in\
  \ the lower decks.\"\n\nMiri's blood went cold, but she kept working. Probably nothing.\
  \ Probably.\n\nThe safe opened with practiced ease. Inside: documentation, provenance,\
  \ Sorokin's insurance files. And a photograph paperclipped to a recent appraisal—showing\
  \ Vivienne Archambault examining this very painting. Miri's former mentor. The woman\
  \ who'd destroyed her career while building her own on stolen credibility. \n\n\
  Her hands shook as she photographed everything. The appraisal was dated three days\
  \ ago.\n\n\"Got it,\" she whispered. \"Coming out.\"\n\n\"Wait.\" Jules's voice\
  \ sharpened. \"That French woman Chen spotted? Security's escorting her to the gallery\
  \ deck. High priority. Miri, she's—\"\n\n\"I know who she is.\" Miri sealed the\
  \ painting in the catering bag Chen had positioned by the service entrance. The\
  \ Grand Prix engines screamed toward the finish line, the crowd's roar shaking the\
  \ harbor. In that chaos, Miri slipped back toward the party, glass of champagne\
  \ materializing in her hand as if she'd never left.\n\nThen she saw her. Vivienne\
  \ Archambault, elegant in navy silk, speaking with Viktor Sorokin at the gallery\
  \ entrance. Even across the deck, Miri felt the weight of that gaze sweeping the\
  \ crowd. Calculating. Searching.\n\nTheir eyes met.\n\nVivienne smiled—that same\
  \ warm smile Miri remembered from university lectures, from late nights cataloging\
  \ Renaissance prints, from the day the police came. She leaned toward Sorokin, whispered\
  \ something. He nodded, touched his earpiece.\n\n\"All teams, we're blown.\" Miri\
  \ kept her voice level. \"She knows.\"\n\n\"How?\" Dmitri demanded.\n\n\"Because\
  \ she taught me everything I know. Exit protocol: scatter and surface. Chen, the\
  \ painting—\"\n\n\"Security's sealing the gangways,\" Jules interrupted. \"She told\
  \ them to lock down. Miri, they're coming for you specifically.\"\n\nThe yacht shuddered\
  \ as its engines engaged, pulling away from dock. Through the windows, Monaco receded.\
  \ They were heading for international waters.\n\n\"The halon system,\" Miri said.\
  \ \"Can you trigger it remotely?\"\n\n\"From environmental controls, yes, but—Miri,\
  \ that'll evacuate the whole deck. People could panic, get hurt.\"\n\n\"Can you\
  \ isolate the gallery and stateroom levels?\"\n\nJules hesitated. \"Maybe. Why?\"\
  \n\n\"Because Vivienne won't evacuate. She'll go for the painting.\" Miri watched\
  \ guards converging through the crowd. Chen was boxed in near the catering station,\
  \ the bag with the Vermeer at his feet. \"Do it. Thirty seconds.\"\n\n\"This isn't\
  \ the plan—\"\n\n\"The plan died when she showed up. Please, Jules.\"\n\nSilence.\
  \ Then: \"I want a raise. Twenty seconds.\"\n\nVivienne was moving now, cutting\
  \ through the party with three security officers. She'd go for Chen first, the obvious\
  \ suspect with his catering access.\n\nAlarms shrieked. Halon gas hissed from vents,\
  \ white fog rolling across the gallery deck. Guests screamed, stampeding toward\
  \ upper levels. In the chaos, Miri ran not away but toward—sliding past guards,\
  \ grabbing the bag as Chen created a distraction by stumbling into a champagne tower.\n\
  \nBut Vivienne had anticipated that too. She stood blocking the service stairs,\
  \ alone, the gas swirling around them both as the deck cleared.\n\n\"Hello, Miriam.\
  \ Still predictable, I see.\"\n\nThe painting was in Miri's hands. The emergency\
  \ exit was fifteen feet away. Jules was screaming warnings about oxygen levels.\
  \ And Vivienne—the woman who'd framed her, who'd stolen her life—stood between Miri\
  \ and everything.\n\n\"You can't have it,\" Miri said.\n\n\"Oh, darling.\" Vivienne's\
  \ smile turned sad. \"I already do. Security has your team. The yacht's in international\
  \ waters. You give me that painting, or Jules goes to prison for the rest of her\
  \ life. I have her room in Paris staked out right now.\"\n\nThe choice crystallized\
  \ with perfect, terrible clarity: the painting or her friend. Justice or revenge.\
  \ \n\nSarah Liebermann's granddaughter's face flashed through her mind. Then Jules's\
  \ voice: \"I trusted you.\"\n\nMiri made her decision."
