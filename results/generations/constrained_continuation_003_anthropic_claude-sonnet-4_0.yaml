output: 'The processing station buzzed with controlled chaos—refugees from corporate
  wars, scientists fleeing government crackdowns, entrepreneurs seeking regulatory
  freedom. Jin felt utterly lost among the polyglot conversations and unfamiliar customs
  until a weathered woman with graying temples approached him.


  "Fresh exile?" Dr. Kala Okafor extended a calloused hand. "I came up here five years
  ago when Lagos tried to disappear me for publishing real sea-level projections.
  You look like the academic type."


  Jin nodded gratefully. "Climate researcher. Well, former researcher."


  "Nothing former about it up here, son. Come on, let me show you how things work."


  Kala guided him through the station''s labyrinthine corridors, explaining the Collective''s
  complex web of allegiances. "Each habitat operates autonomously, but we share resources
  and information freely. No patents, no corporate ownership of discoveries. Your
  carbon capture research? It belongs to humanity now, not some boardroom."


  As they toured the research sectors, Jin discovered something that made his breath
  catch. In Lab Seven, teams were already building on his leaked data—but they''d
  uncovered something he''d missed. The technology didn''t just capture carbon; it
  could transmute atmospheric composition in ways that would make terraforming viable.


  "My God," Jin whispered, staring at the molecular diagrams. "This could transform
  dead worlds into gardens."


  "Or weapons," Kala said quietly. "Atmospheric engineering cuts both ways. That''s
  why we keep it contained here, away from Earth''s war machines."


  Jin spent weeks immersing himself in the Collective''s research protocols, gradually
  finding his footing. The work was exhilarating—unrestricted, collaborative, purposeful.
  Here was exactly what he''d dreamed of: a platform to develop technology that could
  save worlds rather than serve profits.


  But safety demanded silence.


  The revelation came during a late-night conversation with Kala over recycled coffee.
  "The Council knows about the terraforming applications," she admitted. "They''ve
  been negotiating with us for months, offering full amnesty and research funding
  if we''ll share the enhanced data."


  "You''re considering it?" Jin felt betrayed.


  "Some habitats are. The children up here deserve to visit their grandparents'' graves.
  Exile gets lonely, Jin. And Earth needs this technology before the climate tipping
  points render it uninhabitable."


  Jin stared out at Earth''s swirled blue surface, wrestling with impossible mathematics.
  Keep the technology safe in the Collective and watch billions suffer while politicians
  played games. Or release it and risk atmospheric weapons that could snuff out life
  on any world.


  The choice crystallized when he received an encrypted message from Yuna: *The Council
  arrested Mom and Dad. Leveraging their freedom for your return and data. I''m sorry.*


  Jin found himself in the communications bay at 0300, his finger hovering over the
  transmission key. He''d prepared a complete data package—not just the terraforming
  technology, but everything the Collective had discovered. In exchange, his parents
  would walk free, and Earth would have tools to address the climate crisis.


  But he''d also be feeding potential weapons to the same power structures he''d fought
  to expose.


  The transmission went through.


  As confirmation arrived—his parents released, Earth governments already mobilizing
  atmospheric research divisions—Jin felt the complex weight of his choice. He''d
  gained his family''s freedom and given his dying planet a lifeline. But he''d also
  compromised the Collective''s carefully guarded principles and potentially armed
  authoritarian regimes with world-shaping technology.


  Kala found him still sitting in the communications bay hours later, staring at Earth
  through the viewport.


  "Heavy is the hand that reshapes worlds," she said softly, settling beside him.


  Jin nodded, understanding finally that some victories carried the seeds of future
  defeats, and that moral clarity was a luxury refugees couldn''t always afford.'
