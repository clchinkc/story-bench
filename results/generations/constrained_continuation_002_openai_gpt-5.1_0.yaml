output: 'Priya tapped the screen, eyes gleaming. “Two hundred thousand people just
  saw our bus called a disaster. That’s… branding.”


  “Pretty sure that’s slander,” Dev said, but he watched her thumbs fly across the
  cracked screen.


  She quote-tweeted the post: “Disaster? Come taste the train wreck. Show this tweet
  for a free mango lassi with any paneer taco. #PaneerOrNever”


  Dev blinked. “We’re bribing people with yogurt smoothies.”


  “Weapons of mass digestion,” Priya said. “Now flip the parathas. Disaster’s gotta
  be hot.”


  For ten long minutes, nothing happened.


  Then a girl in neon roller skates rolled up, phone held high. “Are you the disaster
  truck?”


  “That’s us,” Priya said, leaning out the window like a carnival barker. “You want
  the Train Wreck Special or the Full Catastrophe Combo?”


  The girl cackled. “Full Catastrophe, obviously.” She kept her camera trained on
  Priya, narrating. “Y’all, I’m at this new food truck that Twitter just dragged,
  and they’re literally making fun of themselves—”


  “Wait till you taste the paneer,” Priya cut in. “Drag us with facts only.”


  The girl posted it as a live. Two skaters became four college kids, then a couple
  in business casual who should have been back at their desks. A guy with a camera
  rig the size of a small child appeared, breathing heavily.


  “Hey, I run the ‘Austin Bites Back’ TikTok,” he said. “Mind if I film?”


  “Only if you tag us,” Dev said, surprising himself. “Handle’s @PaneerPressure.”


  The guy laughed like that was the best thing he’d heard all week. He stationed himself
  where he could catch both the sizzling grill and Priya’s running commentary.


  The orders hit all at once.


  “Three Full Catastrophes, one Train Wreck, six single tacos—”


  “We don’t have a Train Wreck recipe,” Dev hissed.


  “We do now,” Priya said. “It’s the sampler with extra pickled onions and the spicy
  chutney that almost killed your cousin.”


  “That was a medical condition.”


  “Exactly. Memorable.”


  They moved.


  Priya manned the flat-top, shoving marinated paneer cubes into hot cast iron, the
  air blooming with cumin and smoke. Dev handled the tortillas and finishing, hands
  working faster than his brain could complain.


  “Order in! Influencer wants something ‘insane’ for the camera,” Dev called.


  Priya grabbed a tortilla the size of a steering wheel, loaded it with charred paneer,
  brisket ends, slaw, and a dangerous streak of green chutney. She balanced it on
  her forearm like a pizza.


  “Behold,” she announced to the camera, “the Algorithm Destroyer.”


  The TikTok guy nearly screamed. “Do that again, slower.”


  By three o’clock, the line snaked down the block. Priya’s shirt was soaked; Dev’s
  hair had surrendered and curled against his forehead.


  “You good?” she asked quietly as he slammed the window shut long enough to chug
  water.


  He swallowed, breathless, eyes wild and bright. “This is insane. I can’t feel my
  fingers.”


  “Same.” She bumped his shoulder with hers. “But if I have to die under a mountain
  of paneer, there’s no one else I’d rather be crushed with.”


  He snorted, a short, genuine laugh. “We really did this, huh?”


  “We’re doing it,” she corrected, wiping a smear of tikka sauce off his cheek with
  the edge of her apron. “Now open up. The mob hungers.”


  When the last customer finally left, twilight was bruising the sky. The lot buzzed
  with a leftover electricity, the ghost of a crowd.


  Dev slumped onto the cooler. “We sold out. We actually sold out.”


  Priya fanned out a stack of crumpled bills like a winning poker hand. “And we trended.
  Look.” She held up her phone: the roller girl’s video had half a million views.
  The blogger who’d called them a disaster had posted again: “Okay, I might’ve been
  wrong. Disaster Bus is… kind of genius?”


  A honk cut through her victory lap. Headlights swept across the lot as a massive
  matte-black trailer backed into the far corner, guided by a guy in a branded Snapback.


  The side of the trailer gleamed with perfect hand-painted letters: MASALA & MESQUITE.


  Dev read it twice. “You’ve gotta be kidding me.”


  The truck’s serving window flipped open to reveal a spotless stainless-steel kitchen
  and a woman about their age with an undercut and a serious expression. She wore
  a crisp black apron with the Masala & Mesquite logo and a tiny gold nose ring that
  caught the light.


  “Hey, neighbors.” Her voice carried easily. “Heard this lot was popping off. Hope
  you don’t mind the competition.”


  Priya’s smile faltered for the first time all day. “Competition’s good,” she called
  back. “Keeps us spicy.”


  The woman grinned, sharp and professional. “Name’s Anaya. We do Indian-Texas fusion
  too. Brisket biryani, saag enchiladas, that kind of thing. See you at the Championship?”


  She said it like it was already decided they’d all be there.


  After Masala & Mesquite’s lights snapped off for the night, Priya and Dev sat on
  the bus steps, legs dangling, the smell of smoke and ghee still clinging to their
  clothes.


  “Her truck is… really nice,” Dev said quietly.


  “We have charm,” Priya replied, but her voice held a thread of uncertainty. “And
  pink paint.”


  His phone buzzed in his hand. “You should see this.”


  He showed her the screen: a notification from the Austin Food Truck Championship.


  CONGRATS, DISASTER BUS! it read. THANKS TO TODAY’S VIRAL FRENZY, YOU’VE BEEN BUMPED
  TO THE PRO DIVISION. NEW RULES ATTACHED. REMINDER: PRO DIVISION WINNER CLAIMS EXCLUSIVE
  RIGHTS TO THIS LOT FOR ONE YEAR. ALL OTHER TRUCKS WILL BE RELOCATED.


  Beneath it, the attachment loaded: pages of regulations. One line glared up at them.


  ALL PRO DIVISION MENUS MUST OFFER FULL DAIRY-FREE OPTIONS OR FACE DISQUALIFICATION.


  Priya stared at the words, feeling the day’s triumph tilt under her feet. Around
  them, the empty lot hummed with possibility and the distant sound of a rival’s smoker
  coming to life.'
