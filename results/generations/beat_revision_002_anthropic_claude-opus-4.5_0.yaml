output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  Marcus didn''t answer. He was staring at the second page—the one listing creditors
  who''d agreed to the sale. Denise''s husband''s construction company. Third name
  down.


  She followed his gaze. Her silence told him everything.


  "You knew," he said. "How long?"


  "Marcus, I—" She grabbed her purse from the desk. "I''m sorry. I really am. But
  we have kids too. College tuition. You understand."


  The door clicked shut behind her.


  He rubbed his temples. The grant rejection had come yesterday. The fundraiser account
  showed $847—not even enough to cover next month''s utilities, let alone a new location.
  He''d burned through his own savings six months ago keeping the lights on.


  His phone buzzed. His wife: "We need to talk tonight. About the house. The bank
  called again."


  He set the phone face-down.


  On his desk sat fifteen years of photographs. Kids who''d come through these doors
  with nothing and left with scholarships, trade certifications, futures. Devon, now
  an electrician. Maria, nursing school. Jaylen, who''d be dead or in prison without
  this place.


  And now? Twenty-three kids currently enrolled. Twenty-three kids who''d show up
  Monday to locked doors and a sign that said the adults had failed them. Again.


  Marcus looked around the empty room. The water-stained ceiling tiles. The ancient
  basketball hoop missing its net. The mural the kids had painted last summer—bright
  colors spelling out "COMMUNITY" in letters three feet tall.


  He had nothing left. No money. No allies. No plan.


  Just thirty days to watch everything he''d built disappear.'
