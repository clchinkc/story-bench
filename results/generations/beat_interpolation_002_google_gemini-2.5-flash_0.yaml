output: 'The dead line hummed with the ghost of the distorted voice. Sarah Chen stared
  at the photo, Amy’s terrified eyes accusing her. Recant. The word echoed, a tempting,
  poisonous whisper. Marchetti would walk, a monster unleashed, but Amy would live.
  It was the easy way, the craven way, and it made her stomach churn. Her badge felt
  heavy, a condemnation. She couldn''t sacrifice everything she stood for.


  Her first, truest instinct was to call Captain Morrison, to raise the alarm, to
  unleash the full force of the NYPD. They had resources, intelligence, tactical teams.
  She could bring in Marcus. Detective Marcus Webb, her partner, found her hunched
  over her desk an hour later, the picture of Amy hidden beneath a stack of cold cases.


  "You look like hell, Chen. What’s going on?" Marcus''s voice was gruff, solicitous.


  Sarah hesitated, then slid the photo across the desk. His face blanched. "Jesus,
  Sarah. Who…?"


  She recounted the call, the impossible ultimatum. "We go to Morrison," Marcus insisted,
  his jaw tight. "We lock down the precinct, bring in the feds if we have to. This
  is kidnapping, blackmail. They just declared war on the department."


  "And while the department mobilizes, while the paperwork clears, while they try
  to find a ghost in the system, Amy dies," Sarah countered, her voice raw. "Marchetti''s
  family has eyes and ears everywhere, Marcus. You know it. We can''t trust anyone
  inside, not with a timeline this tight. The blackmailer knows that too. They *expect*
  me to go to official channels, to waste precious hours."


  The thought of relying on bureaucracy, of navigating internal politics when Amy''s
  life hung by a thread, sent a cold dread through her. Her duty as a cop demanded
  justice, demanded Marchetti stay behind bars. Her duty as a sister screamed for
  Amy''s survival, no matter the cost. Neither path they expected – recanting or reporting
  – would save Amy *and* keep Marchetti incarcerated. A third option, a darker, riskier
  path, began to solidify. It was the only way.'
