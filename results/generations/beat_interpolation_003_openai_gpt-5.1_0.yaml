output: 'The crew quarters were wrong in all the quiet ways.


  Bunks unmade mid-shift. A tablet still playing an ancient sitcom looped into static.
  Two mugs of coffee—one dried to a dark ring, the other half-full and cold enough
  to have filmed over with ice. No bodies. No blood. Just absence arranged like a
  crime scene.


  Yuki swept her scanner in slow arcs. Life signs: negative. Environmental: nominal.
  But the EM field graph jittered, a sawtooth pattern that made no sense in a closed
  system.


  She caught it in peripheral vision first—a flicker, like heat above asphalt. When
  she turned, nothing. The scanner, however, hiccupped, its display smearing into
  nonsense characters for a heartbeat before stabilizing.


  “Instrument artifact,” she muttered, but she logged the anomaly anyway.


  The med bay was worse.


  Discipline lived here: labeled drawers, numbered cultures, a Kronin’s Disease patient
  simulator still running through lung-degeneration models. On a central bed lay a
  restraint harness, straps buckled but empty, the mattress indented as if someone
  invisible still pressed upon it.


  Her tablet pinged. She opened the last recorded log, Reyes’s voice fractured by
  static.


  “—promising results with dimensional—” crackle “—core isolated in Lab Sev—” a metallic
  screech overrode the rest, spiking her audio filters.


  “Dimensional what?” Yuki whispered.


  Temperature dropped three degrees in as many seconds. Her breath fogged. Lights
  along the far wall strobed, triggered by motion sensors that should have been seeing
  nothing.


  Something moved between the beds, a ripple in the air refracting metal into wavering
  lines. Cabinets rattled as it passed. One slammed open, spilling vials that cracked
  on the floor, releasing a sharp antiseptic tang.


  Yuki backed toward the exit, pulse racing. “If you’re there, identify yourself.”


  The thing surged toward her, a distortion field compressing the air, her skin prickling
  as though her molecules wanted to misalign. Her scanner spiked into overload, then
  died with a pop, the casing hot in her palm.


  She hit the emergency bulkhead control. For a sick second, the door hesitated, its
  motor fighting some invisible drag. Then it slammed down, cutting off the cold and
  the pressure, leaving her in the humming quiet of the corridor, heart pounding.


  Hostile, she categorized, forcing her breathing to slow. Unknown entity. Possibly
  multiple.


  She rerouted around the sealed med bay, following the spine of the station toward
  the labs. Twice more, her remaining instruments recorded brief gravitational blips,
  like the station shrugging. In the hydroponics module, plants had burst their trays,
  vines fused through metal mesh as if grown in fast-forward, tagged with handwritten
  notes: “Trial C – field exposure + serum.”


  Everywhere, the same pattern: work interrupted at the moment of breakthrough. References
  in scattered logs to “field harmonics,” “overlap,” “transit window.” And one phrase,
  repeated in Reyes’s terse, encrypted orders Yuki finally coaxed from a stubborn
  terminal in Operations:


  “If containment fails, the data core is priority. Lab Seven. Secure it. Get it off-station.”


  Yuki straightened from the console, jaw set. Whatever prowled these corridors, whatever
  had happened to Prometheus, the answer—and the cure—waited in Lab Seven.


  She adjusted the teleporter recall beacon at her belt, now set to lock onto her
  biometrics and the largest adjacent mass. A crude safeguard, but better than nothing
  if the distortions tried to tear her apart.


  Then she walked toward the lab sector, deeper into the storm inside the station,
  determined to reach the core or vanish trying.'
