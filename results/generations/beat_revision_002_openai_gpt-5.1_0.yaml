output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community

  center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property developer
  had

  won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  He let the paper sag in his grip. "We already did it," he said, voice flat. "The
  appeal,

  the petition, the town hall. The judge signed off this morning. It''s over."


  Denise shifted, avoiding his eyes. "The fundraiser—"


  "Got canceled," he cut in. "Remember? Once Keller bought the old high school, the
  donors

  pulled out. No one wants their name on a sinking ship."


  She swallowed. "The grant application—"


  He rubbed his temples. "Rejected. Came in an hour ago. I just didn''t know how to
  tell

  everyone yet."


  Silence pressed in. From the gym down the hall came the faint echo of a basketball

  thudding, kids shouting his name like it still meant something.


  Denise set a folder on his desk without meeting his gaze. "The board voted this

  afternoon," she murmured. "Unanimous. They signed the agreement with Keller. I…
  helped

  draft it. They offered me a position running his new ''youth initiative.'' It''s
  the only

  way I could stay in the field."


  The words hit harder than the notice.


  His phone buzzed. A new message from his wife lit the screen: a photo of their kids

  asleep on the couch, followed by, We can''t afford to lose the house too, Marcus.
  Please

  let it go.


  He turned the phone facedown.


  For fifteen years, this place had been his answer to every bad thing he''d seen
  in the

  world. Now there was nowhere to move it, no money to save it, no one left willing
  to

  stand next to him.


  The shouts from the gym faded as the custodian killed the lights, one by one, until
  the

  hallway outside his office went dark.'
