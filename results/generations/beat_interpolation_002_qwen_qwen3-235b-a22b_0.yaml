output: "Sarah stared at the photo, Amy’s face pale against the warehouse shadows.\
  \ Recanting would be simplest. Marchetti walks, Amy lives. Her fingers brushed the\
  \ desk where her badge lay beside her gun. Could she live with that? Marchetti’s\
  \ smirk in the courtroom replayed—*he knew* she’d seen him shoot. Letting him go\
  \ would poison her faster than any bullet.  \n\nAt the precinct, Marcus Webb caught\
  \ her hovering near his desk. “You look like hell,” he said, squinting at her unblinking.\
  \ She handed him the photo. His jaw tightened. “We’ll call in a tactical team. FBI,\
  \ even. They’ve got resources—”  \n\n“They’ve got leaks,” Sarah countered, arms\
  \ crossed. “The Marchettis’ money seeps everywhere. Who here’s on their payroll?\
  \ Morrison? Your buddy Ruiz?”  \n\nMarcus leaned forward, voice low. “Don’t do this\
  \ alone. Let us help.”  \n\n“*Us*?” She gestured to the bustling squad room, where\
  \ Lieutenant Ruiz laughed too loudly at a joke. The same Ruiz who’d asked too many\
  \ questions about her sister last month. She swallowed bile. “If I go to Internal\
  \ Affairs, how long before Marchetti’s men hear about it?”  \n\n“Not everyone’s\
  \ corrupt,” Marcus pleaded.  \n\nShe stared at his computer screen—his email open,\
  \ a message from an untraceable account flagged in red. *His account too?* Her stomach\
  \ dropped. “You’re right,” she murmured. “But I can’t gamble with Amy’s life on\
  \ what-ifs.”  \n\nThat night, she copied case files onto her laptop, each click\
  \ echoing in the dark. Marcus’s offer had been earnest, but Marchetti’s web reached\
  \ too far. She couldn’t trust the system she’d once believed in, and she refused\
  \ to become another cautionary tale.  \n\nThe resignation letter, crisp in her hand,\
  \ felt less like defeat than a scalpel cutting through rot. She’d play the system’s\
  \ game—then bury it.  \n\nOutside, the Marchetti compound loomed. Seventy hours\
  \ to dismantle a dynasty. She’d start by becoming a ghost."
