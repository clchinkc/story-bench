output: 'Rosa’s body had been taken out through the Buckingham’s service door like
  contraband, wrapped and anonymous, but the hotel kept her anyway. Grief clung to
  the banister where they’d steadied the gurney: a slow violet haze, pulsing like
  a bruise. Dante stood in the lobby with his hands jammed in his jacket pockets,
  staring at residue only he could see, trying not to taste the old familiar urge
  that came with helplessness. Three years clean and still his brain offered him shortcuts—one
  little chemical apology, one clean wipe of the slate.


  “Don’t move.” The voice came from the mezzanine, sharp as broken glass. A woman
  descended the stairs two at a time, hood up, dark hair tied back. Her eyes weren’t
  just watchful; they were armed. “You’re Rosa’s stray, right? The one she pulled
  off the alleys.”


  Dante lifted his palms. “Dante Reyes. I wasn’t stray.”


  “Addict, then.” She said it like a diagnosis that explained everything. “I’m Mina
  Park. Rosa said if she ever went quiet, you’d come nosing around and make it worse.”


  The lobby’s air shifted, a ripple of anxious green—Resonants gathering in the back
  hall, whispering about a killer that didn’t just murder, but emptied people out.
  Mina watched him like she expected him to crack and run to the nearest bottle.


  A door banged somewhere deeper in the hotel. Footsteps. Then a hissed, panicked
  voice: “He’s here—”


  Panic spiked, and the residue reacted: jagged red shards flared along the walls,
  sharp enough to make Dante’s teeth ache. Under pressure his gift always tried to
  drown him, every feeling in the room screaming for shape. He forced himself into
  the anchor Rosa had taught him: inhale, name five real things, exhale. The floor
  under his boots was real. The cold brass of the stair rail was real. The chip in
  the lobby’s marble was real.


  Mina grabbed his sleeve. “We don’t have time for your meditation.”


  “It’s not meditation,” he said, and pushed past her toward the sound. The back hall
  smelled of old carpet and rain. A man—Nico, the hotel’s caretaker—stood by the service
  elevator, insisting too loudly that everyone should leave, that the Buckingham wasn’t
  safe, that he’d seen something. His words painted the air with pale blue sincerity,
  but around his left hand Dante saw a different residue clinging like oil: a thin,
  metallic gold thread, taut with calculation.


  Gold wasn’t fear. Gold was profit.


  Dante’s gaze snagged on a small object half-hidden in the ashtray by the elevator:
  a sliver of glass, like a broken compact mirror, its edge coated with prismatic
  film. Rosa’s. He picked it up without thinking and the hallway’s colors split through
  it—red fear into separate bands, green envy, black shame. Nico’s gold thread brightened,
  unmistakable.


  “Someone’s been selling our locations,” Dante said. “It’s him.”


  Nico’s face tightened. “You don’t know what you’re seeing, junkie.”


  The word hit like a match to gasoline. Dante’s hands trembled, not from craving
  but from the old shame that always accompanied it, the same shame that had kept
  him from answering his sister’s late-night calls because he’d been too busy chasing
  his own oblivion. He swallowed hard, kept his voice steady. “I know residue. And
  I know a lie.”


  Mina’s eyes narrowed. She stepped closer to Nico and, for a second, her attention
  went distant—her own gift working, tasting the room’s mood. “He’s…wrong,” she said,
  surprised by her own certainty.


  Nico reached into his coat. Mina reacted first, shoulder-checking Dante aside as
  a blade flashed. Dante stumbled, saw the knife’s arc leave a streak of hot orange
  aggression, and he moved without thinking—grabbed the elevator’s fire extinguisher
  and slammed it into Nico’s wrist. The knife clattered. Nico bolted down the corridor,
  leaving behind a trail of gold.


  Mina stared at Dante, breath quick. “Rosa really taught you,” she said, like she
  hated admitting it.


  “She taught me how not to disappear,” Dante answered. He held up the prismatic shard.
  “She also left this.”


  Mina’s expression softened for one beat, then hardened again into purpose. “If he’s
  the leak, then the killer has a map. And if Rosa’s dead, we’re next.”


  They made their plan in the Buckingham’s old lounge, where cigarette smoke had once
  layered the air and now only residue lingered—ghostly rings of longing and laughter
  drifting near the ceiling. Mina spread a city map on the cracked bar and marked
  the last three attacks: places that had once been safe for Resonants. Dante watched
  the lines form a spiral tightening toward the hotel.


  “He’s not hunting randomly,” Mina said. “He’s herding.”


  Dante turned Rosa’s shard over in his fingers. In its surface the lounge’s melancholy
  fractured into softer shades. “He knew where she’d be,” he murmured. “And he knows
  me. That’s what scares me.”


  Mina studied him. “Rosa said you had a sister.”


  The question opened a trapdoor in Dante’s chest. He saw his sister, Marisol, sixteen
  and bright, leaning in a doorway with a desperate smile, asking him to come home,
  to be her brother again. He’d told her later. He’d told her tomorrow. Tomorrow had
  arrived with a paramedic’s voice and a bag of belongings that smelled like cold
  metal. The guilt had never stopped coloring the world.


  “She died,” he said. “Overdose. I was…around, but not present. If this killer is
  draining Resonants—taking what makes us feel—maybe he’s been around longer than
  we think.”


  Mina’s jaw worked, anger and pity warring. “Then your guilt is going to be the door
  he walks through. He’ll use it.”


  “I know.” Dante rubbed his thumb along the shard’s edge until it bit him, a clean
  sting. “That’s why we don’t let him choose the room. We choose it.”


  They gathered what they could: Mina’s notebook full of names and moods, a small
  flashlight, salt packets from the hotel’s emergency kit—old Resonant folklore that
  sometimes helped break a charge in a saturated space. Dante tucked Rosa’s shard
  into his wallet like a relic. They cornered another Resonant and got a trembling
  confession: Nico had been paid, not by cash, but by the promise of emptiness—no
  more unbearable feelings. That promise felt like the killer’s signature.


  When it was time, Dante’s confidence thinned. At the threshold of the Buckingham’s
  sealed ballroom, the air was colder, heavy with decades of weddings and betrayals
  and last dances. The door itself wore a crust of residue, layered so thick it looked
  almost physical, like frost in rainbow. Beyond it, the spiral on Mina’s map ended.


  Mina gripped the doorknob. “You don’t have to do this.”


  Dante heard his own heartbeat, loud as footsteps in an empty stairwell. “Yes,” he
  said, and hated how much his voice shook. “If I keep running from what I did—what
  I didn’t do—he’ll keep finding me anyway.”


  They pushed inside, and the ballroom swallowed them.


  The killer didn’t step from the shadows; he was already in the room’s center, as
  if he’d been waiting in the residue itself. Tall, coat neat, face indistinct in
  the dim, like someone had erased his features with a careful hand. Around him the
  air was wrong—washed-out, gray, as if feelings had been wrung dry. On the floor
  lay a circle of objects: tokens taken from Resonants, each one faintly humming with
  stolen color.


  “You brought her mirror,” the killer said softly, and Dante’s stomach dropped. “Rosa’s
  little trick.”


  Mina shifted beside Dante, trying to place herself between him and the man. “Stay
  back,” she warned, voice hard. But fear tinged her aura a thin, bright yellow. The
  killer’s head tilted toward it like a hungry animal.


  Dante saw the trap an instant too late. The ballroom’s residue surged—black shame
  rising off the floorboards in waves, thick as tar. It wasn’t the room’s history;
  it was curated, concentrated, aimed. It slammed into Dante’s chest and detonated
  every memory he’d ever tried to lock away. Marisol on a bathroom tile, lips blue.
  Marisol’s last text, unanswered. His own reflection in a bar mirror, pupils blown
  wide, promising himself he’d fix it after one more.


  He dropped to his knees. The world narrowed to guilt, and in that narrowing he felt
  himself hollowing, like the killer’s victims. A grayness crept along his arms, draining
  the colors he could see until even the ballroom’s ghosts faded.


  “This is what you are,” the killer murmured. “A door made of regret.”


  Mina shouted his name, distant. Then the killer’s hand touched her wrist and Dante
  saw her aura flare and begin to bleach. She gasped, knees buckling.


  All seemed lost with the simplicity of it: he couldn’t fight memory. He couldn’t
  punch his way out of what he’d done.


  Rosa’s voice returned, not as sound but as the steadiness she’d pressed into him:
  Feel it. Don’t let it own you.


  Dante forced his fingers to his wallet, to the shard. He held it up, and through
  the prism the black shame split into components: not one monolith, but layers—his
  grief, his anger, his love, his fear. Beneath it all, a thin thread of something
  else that didn’t belong to him, braided into the shame like wire. The killer’s residue.
  Not profit-gold like Nico’s, but a starving, pale silver: self-loathing disguised
  as appetite.


  Dante looked at the killer through the shard and, for the first time, saw him—not
  faceless, but a man caged by his own emptiness. The killer recoiled as if exposed.


  “You’re not feeding,” Dante rasped. “You’re trying to disappear.”


  The killer’s hand faltered on Mina’s wrist. His gray field wavered.


  Dante’s guilt rose again, but this time he let it stand beside him instead of on
  top of him. “Marisol is dead,” he said, voice breaking cleanly, honestly, without
  bargaining. “I didn’t save her. I will carry that. But I won’t use it to destroy
  other people.”


  He dragged a salt packet from his pocket and tore it open with shaking teeth, spilling
  it in a line across the ballroom floor. Not magic, not really—just a boundary, a
  signal to his own mind as much as anything. Mina, half-drained, understood and crawled
  to extend the line, her hands leaving faint trails of stubborn green. Together they
  closed the circle around the tokens on the floor.


  Dante held the shard over the circle and angled it so the room’s remaining colors
  refracted, scattering back into the stolen objects. The killer lunged, but when
  he crossed the salt line his own silver self-loathing flared bright through the
  prism, blinding him with what he’d tried not to feel. He staggered, choking on his
  own residue.


  Mina yanked her wrist free and shoved him back into the gray he’d made. “Now,” she
  hissed.


  Dante didn’t strike. He spoke, because understanding was the only weapon that fit.
  “You’re not the only one who wants numbness,” he said. “But you don’t get to take
  it from us.”


  The killer’s posture collapsed, the gray field thinning. For a heartbeat the ballroom’s
  ghosts breathed again—faint laughter, a soft blue wistfulness—colors returning like
  a tide. The killer retreated into the shadows, wounded not by force but by recognition,
  leaving the circle of tokens trembling with reawakened hues.


  Dante sat back on his heels, shaking, tears hot on his face. The guilt was still
  there, heavy as ever, but it wasn’t a tide pulling him under anymore. It was a stone
  in his pocket—real, carried, not worshiped.


  Mina sank beside him, exhausted, color slowly returning to her cheeks. She looked
  at him with something like trust, earned in the ugliest light. “He’ll come back,”
  she said.


  Dante closed his fist around Rosa’s shard until its edge pressed into his skin,
  a reminder. “Then next time,” he answered, staring into the ballroom’s returning
  colors, “we’ll be ready to see him clearly.”'
