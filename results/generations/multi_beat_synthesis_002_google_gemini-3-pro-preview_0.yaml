output: 'The red laterite dust of the Cape Coast road coated Amara’s bare feet, a
  physical reminder of the soil she was trying to save. She adjusted the heavy basket
  of yams atop her head, not because of the weight, but to hide the trembling of her
  hands. Inside the folds of her wrapped cloth, pressed against the small of her back,
  the stolen letter burned like a coal. It detailed the hanging of her father and
  three other elders, scheduled for the next new moon.


  At the colony’s perimeter, the architecture of empire gave way to the unruly bush.
  A checkpoint manned by two Hausa soldiers and a sweating British corporal blocked
  the road. This was the threshold. Behind her lay the Governor’s library, where she
  was merely a shadow who dusted books and silently absorbed the King’s English, German,
  and the strategic maps of the interior. Ahead lay the unknown.


  "Halt," the corporal barked, swatting a tsetse fly. "Papers."


  Amara slumped her shoulders, extinguishing the intelligence in her eyes to become
  the dull-witted servant they expected. She produced the travel pass she had forged
  the night before by tracing the Governor’s hand. She held her breath as the corporal
  squinted at the signature.


  "Governor’s kitchen staff," the corporal muttered, bored. He gestured to a stack
  of crates behind him, awaiting transport. "Move along. And mind the surveyors up
  road. If you see trees marked with the Broad Arrow, stay clear. That’s Crown property
  now."


  Amara glanced at the crates. Burnt into the wood was the Broad Arrow—the three-pronged
  symbol of British government property. It was a mark of ownership, of seizure. She
  nodded rapidly, feigning ignorance, and hurried past. As the sounds of the garrison
  faded, she straightened her spine. The servant girl had dissolved into the dust;
  only the messenger remained. There was no turning back.


  The jungle canopy swallowed the light, turning the world into a humid twilight of
  green and grey. Two days into the trek, the silence of the forest was broken by
  the snap of a twig. Amara froze, her hand slipping to the knife concealed in her
  wrap.


  A man stepped from the undergrowth, clad in the worn tunic of a coastal trader.
  He raised his hands, palms open. "Peace, sister. The road is not safe for a woman
  alone."


  "Nor for a man with no goods to trade," Amara replied in Fante, her eyes scanning
  him. He carried no pack, and his sandals were too clean for a long journey.


  "I lost my wares to a patrol," he claimed, stepping closer. "I am Kwesi. I can guide
  you to the next village."


  Amara studied him. His Fante was fluent, but his cadence was wrong—too clipped,
  too precise. It was the rhythm of a man who learned the language from books, not
  from a mother. She decided to gamble.


  "Sie lügen," she said softly in German. *You are lying.*


  The man flinched, his eyes widening in shock before he could mask the reaction.
  He was a spy for the Basel Mission or perhaps the Germans in Togoland, looking for
  advantages against the British.


  "Who are you?" he whispered, dropping the trader persona.


  "Someone who knows that a ''trader'' without calluses is a liability," she snapped.
  Before he could respond, the distant, rhythmic tramp of boots echoed through the
  trees. A British patrol.


  "Quiet," she commanded. The fear that had plagued her in Cape Coast was gone, replaced
  by a cold, sharp clarity. She grabbed the spy’s arm and dragged him into the hollow
  of a silk-cotton tree. As the red-coated soldiers marched past, oblivious to the
  eyes watching them, Amara realized she was no longer just carrying a message. She
  was the resistance. She possessed the weapons her father lacked: the enemy’s tongue
  and the ability to see what was hidden.


  By the fourth day, the air grew thinner as the elevation rose toward the hidden
  caves of the Ashanti stronghold. Amara’s legs burned, and the water in her gourd
  was long gone, but the adrenaline of the final approach pushed her forward. This
  was the sanctuary where her father was meant to be hiding, the "Inmost Cave" where
  the resistance planned their next strike.


  She paused at the edge of the clearing that led to the cave mouth. It was quiet—too
  quiet. The birds, usually raucous at this hour, were silent.


  She prepared to step into the clearing, to shout the greeting her father had taught
  her, but her gaze snagged on a mahogany tree five yards to her left. The bark had
  been freshly hacked away near the roots, obscured by ferns.


  Amara crept closer, her heart hammering against her ribs. There, carved into the
  pale, exposed wood, was a symbol: the three-pronged Broad Arrow.


  The image of the crates at the checkpoint flashed in her mind. *Crown property.*


  The British weren’t just pursuing her; they were already here. The silence wasn’t
  peace; it was an ambush. The surveyors the corporal mentioned hadn''t been marking
  timber; they had been marking a kill zone. If she walked into that cave, she wouldn''t
  be greeting her father; she would be joining him in chains.


  Amara sank into the ferns, the intercepted letter heavy against her skin. She could
  not deliver the warning to the cave. She had to become the warning. Taking a deep
  breath, she turned away from the trap, moving silently into the deep bush to find
  the secondary outpost, knowing that the war had truly begun.'
