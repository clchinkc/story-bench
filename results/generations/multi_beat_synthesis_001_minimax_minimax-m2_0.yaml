output: 'The abandoned Buckingham Hotel exhaled a winter that had not yet arrived,
  its lobby an ocean of dust and the ghost of velvet. I stood where the front desk
  had been, watching the air thicken with colors from the city''s bleeding hearts—yellows
  of relief from the subway, a smear of crimson grief from a funeral home two blocks
  away. My gift felt like a bruise that never healed. Rosa had taught me to read the
  residue and not be swallowed by it, to take the shape of a feeling and step out
  the other side. Three years clean, I still carried the tremor of old cravings like
  a second heartbeat, and when I closed my eyes, the cravings flickered silver-blue
  at the edges of my vision.


  A woman stepped out of the stairwell, black hair in a knot, a scarf wrapped twice
  around her throat. Her eyes were the color of old pennies and she looked at me like
  I was a liar who had already been caught. "You''re the one who sees the colors,"
  she said. "Dante. Rosa talked about you. She also said you used to chase the high
  harder than most chase the light."


  I swallowed the sting. "Three years. The rest is still there, just quieter."


  She didn''t nod. "I''m Marin. I taste emotions on my tongue. Sweet, bitter, metallic.
  Right now, yours tastes like copper and panic. If you''re working with us, you better
  not be carrying poison."


  The room shifted as more Resonants arrived, their gifts a chorus of whispers—sound
  that smelled like rain, memories that tasted like citrus, shadows that tasted like
  ash. They gathered around a circle chalked on the floor, the chalk made from powdered
  marble and bone and something older. Rosa had used the chalk to anchor the room,
  to keep the residue from rising and drowning us. I knelt and pressed my palm to
  the circle and felt the chalk vibrate. The air bloomed, and the colors steadied
  into shapes: a jagged ribbon of fear, a bruised circle of rage, a thin thread of
  sorrow that seemed to be reaching toward the door.


  Marin crouched beside me, her voice low. "Show me you can read it under pressure."


  A man in a gray coat stepped into the circle, his face unmarked by emotion, his
  smile too practiced. He was one of us, or claimed to be—his name was Eamon Vale,
  a resonant who specialized in smoothing the sharp edges of feeling, turning a scream
  into a hum. He said, "The killer''s latest victim is in the west wing. We need someone
  to trace the residue left behind."


  The chalk vibrated harder, and the ribbon of fear thickened, turning black at its
  center. I closed my eyes and let the colors pull me along. The thread of sorrow
  wove into the ribbon of fear, and something else slipped through, a thin silver
  that tasted like the inside of a needle. My heart stuttered, and I saw the room
  tilt. I had to hold steady. The cravings flickered silver-blue, and I pushed them
  down, counting breaths, one, two, three. The silver thread thinned and snapped.


  "I can see it," I said, and opened my eyes. "It goes down. Basement. And there''s
  a taste like metal. A siphon."


  Eamon''s smile sharpened. "A siphon. Interesting. Rosa always said you were sensitive."
  He stepped out of the circle and moved toward the door, the chalk dust settling
  on his coat like snow. Marin gripped my wrist, her fingers cold. "Wait," she said.
  "Look at the chalk."


  I looked down. In the chalk circle, the shapes had rearranged themselves. The silver
  thread had braided with the fear, and where Eamon had stood, the chalk had burned
  a dark bruise. The bruise spelled a name, faint and backward, as if the chalk had
  tried to spit it out and failed. I felt the name in my bones, a weight I had carried
  and never named. Eamon Vale.


  "He''s the siphon," Marin said, her voice barely a whisper. "He''s the one feeding
  on us, turning us into hollows."


  Eamon paused at the door and turned back, his eyes flat and bright. "You''re wrong,"
  he said, and the words tasted like poison. "But it''s sweet that you think you can
  see me." He lifted his hand, and the chalk circle flared, then dimmed, the colors
  folding inward like a closing fist. The room went quiet. Marin squeezed my wrist
  hard enough to leave a bruise. "Prove me right," she said. "Prove you''re not poison."


  We went to the west wing, the hotel''s corridors a spine of broken glass and rotted
  wallpaper. The residue grew thicker the further we went, until the air felt like
  wet cement. The basement door was chained and locked, the metal cold and slick.
  I pressed my palm to the chain and felt the silver thread again, a low hum beneath
  the metal. "It''s not just a chain," I said. "It''s keyed to grief. His grief. Or
  ours."


  Marin pulled a copper tuning fork from her pocket, the handle etched with lines
  so fine they looked like veins. "Rosa gave me this," she said. "She said if you
  ever needed to tune the room to your own frequency, this would sing." She struck
  the fork against the chain and it rang, a pure note that cut through the hum. The
  chain shivered, and the silver thread thinned. I pressed harder, and the chain broke
  with a sigh. We stepped into the dark.


  The basement was a throat of stone, the air thick with the smell of old blood and
  cleaner. A woman hung from the ceiling, her eyes blank, her skin pale as paper.
  Rosa''s student, a girl whose name I had never learned. She was alive, barely. Eamon
  stood in the center of the room, a vial in his hand, the liquid inside moving like
  a living thing. "You came," he said. "Good. Rosa told me you''d be stubborn. She
  told me you were carrying something heavy. Guilt. Your sister''s overdose. Mine
  too. I fed her once. She asked for it. She wanted the quiet."


  The words hit like a slap. My vision narrowed, and the silver thread swelled, filling
  my throat. I tasted metal, and the cravings flickered silver-blue, bright and hungry.
  I wanted to run. I wanted to crawl into a corner and disappear. The room tilted,
  and I felt the chalk under my feet like a grave. Marin reached for me, but I pulled
  away, my hands shaking. "I can''t," I whispered. "I can''t face this."


  Eamon smiled, and the vial''s liquid pulsed. "You don''t have to face it," he said.
  "You can let me take it. Let me drain the noise. Let me make you clean."


  The silver thread tightened around my ribs, and I felt myself begin to fall. The
  basement stretched and bent, and the woman on the ceiling swayed like a pendulum.
  I was drowning, not in water, but in the shape of my own failure. My sister, the
  night she died, the way I had stood in the doorway and done nothing because I was
  high and afraid and angry and selfish. I had wanted to save her, but I had saved
  myself instead, and she had paid the price. The guilt was a weight, a stone, a truth.
  It was mine.


  I stopped fighting it. I let it sit inside me, heavy and sharp and mine. I stopped
  running from it, stopped feeding it with more poison. I let it be what it was, and
  the silver thread loosened. I opened my eyes. The basement came back into focus.
  The woman on the ceiling was still, but her chest rose and fell. Eamon''s vial slowed,
  the liquid settling like dust. Marin stood beside me, her hand on my shoulder, her
  face pale but steady.


  I reached into my pocket and pulled out the copper tuning fork. Rosa had given it
  to me the day she taught me how to anchor a room, how to hold a feeling without
  being swallowed by it. It was simple, a tool, a thing. But it was also a key. I
  struck it against the stone floor and let it ring. The note filled the room, and
  the chalk dust rose, and the residue sang. The note found Eamon''s name, the one
  the chalk had tried to spit out, and held it. The room shook, and the shapes rearranged
  themselves again. The fear ribbon turned back into a thread, the rage bruise smoothed
  into a line, the sorrow thread grew thin and faded. Eamon''s smile cracked. The
  vial slipped from his fingers and shattered, the liquid spilling into the floor,
  soaking into the chalk, vanishing like a bad dream.


  "You can''t," he said, but his voice was smaller now. "You can''t hold this."


  "I can," I said. "And I will." I stepped toward him, the tuning fork in my hand,
  the note steady and true. "You''re not quiet," I told him. "You''re empty. And emptiness
  is hungry. It eats what it can, and when it can''t, it lies."


  The woman on the ceiling stirred, her eyes blinking. She took a breath, and another.
  Marin moved to her side and cut her down, her hands gentle. Eamon tried to step
  back, but the note held him, and the room held him, and the chalk held him. He looked
  at me and saw something he hadn''t expected. Not a hollow. Not a void. A man carrying
  a weight he had finally decided to carry with him.


  The vial''s liquid had left a stain on the floor, and the stain spelled a name in
  chalk dust, faint but clear. Eamon Vale. It was the last thing he tried to hide.
  I had seen it in the lobby, in the way the chalk bruised where he stood. I had seen
  it now in the way the room refused to bend to his hunger. He was not the quiet he
  claimed to be. He was the noise that ate other people''s noise.


  The woman on the floor opened her eyes and looked at me like she was waking from
  a long dream. "Rosa," she whispered. "She said you''d come."


  "We came," I said. "We''re here."


  Marin took my hand and squeezed it. "You did it," she said. "You faced it."


  I didn''t answer with words. I answered with the note. The tuning fork rang, and
  the room breathed. The chalk settled. The residue quieted. We climbed the stairs
  and left the basement behind. The hotel was still an ocean of dust, but the air
  felt lighter. The cravings were still there, silver-blue at the edges, but they
  were quiet now. I had carried my guilt and not been swallowed by it. I had faced
  the truth and not let it become a weapon against me. I had won not by strength,
  but by understanding. And the understanding was mine, and it was heavy, and it was
  honest, and it was enough.'
