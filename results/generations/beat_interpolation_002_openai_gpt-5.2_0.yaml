output: 'Sarah set the photograph on her kitchen table like evidence, squared to the
  edge. Amy’s wrists were bound with plastic ties; the chair legs were bolted to concrete.
  Warehouse light, sodium-orange, and a shadow in the corner that could have been
  a pallet jack or a man. Sarah cataloged details until her eyes burned, then forced
  herself to look at the red phone number again.


  Recanting was an option. The simplest lever to pull. Walk into court, say she’d
  been mistaken, that stress and distance and bad lighting had filled in Vincent Marchetti’s
  face. Her mouth could form the words. The law would even give her room to. But her
  stomach twisted at the thought of Amy living because Sarah had helped a murderer
  walk—and of Amy dying anyway, because extortionists didn’t honor agreements. Seventy-two
  hours was a deadline, not a promise.


  Official channels were what she’d been trained to trust. She could go straight to
  Morrison, file a kidnapping report, request an emergency task force, pull phone
  records, get the tech unit to work the call. She could put a protective detail on
  herself, on Amy’s apartment—except Amy wasn’t at her apartment. Time mattered, and
  bureaucracy ate time.


  She texted Marcus Webb anyway: Need you. Now.


  He arrived in ten minutes, coat half-buttoned, eyes sharp the moment he saw the
  photo. He didn’t ask why Sarah’s hands shook; he just slid into the chair opposite
  her and leaned in.


  “We take this upstairs,” Marcus said. “Morrison, DA, FBI liaison. We lock this down.
  We trace the number, we hit warrants. We don’t freelance.”


  Sarah wanted to believe him. She wanted a clean chain of custody and a cavalry that
  showed up on time. “What if someone hears,” she said, keeping her voice flat. “What
  if someone makes a call before we get out of the building?”


  Marcus hesitated—just a fraction. “You think we’ve got a leak.”


  She opened her laptop, pulled up the case management system, and turned the screen
  toward him. Someone had accessed the Marchetti witness file after midnight. Not
  her. Not Marcus. A supervisor login. She didn’t need a name; the implication was
  enough.


  Marcus exhaled through his nose. “We can still—”


  “If I go through the department and Amy dies, I’ll never forgive myself,” Sarah
  said. “If I recant and Amy lives, I’ll never forgive myself. Either way, staying
  inside the lines makes me predictable.”


  Marcus’s gaze held hers, worry and anger braided together. “So what are you saying?”


  Sarah stared at her badge on the counter, at the weight of it. Duty had always been
  a shield. Tonight it felt like a tether. “I’m saying they’re watching the lines,”
  she said. “And I need to move where they can’t.”'
