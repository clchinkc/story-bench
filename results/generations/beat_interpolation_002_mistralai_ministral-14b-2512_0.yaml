output: 'The photograph burned against Sarah’s palm as she paced her apartment, the
  distorted voice still echoing in her skull. *Seventy-two hours.* The clock was already
  ticking. She could still call the number, agree to recant, and walk away—no blood
  on her hands, no risk to herself. But Amy’s face in that warehouse, the terror in
  her sister’s wide eyes, made her stomach twist. *Easy. Coward’s way.* She crushed
  the photo in her fist.


  Next, the badge. She could go to Internal Affairs, blow the whistle on the Marchetti
  corruption in the department, let the system handle it. But the system was the problem.
  Captain Morrison’s office was a maze of red tape and compromised officers. The Marchetti
  name alone would bury any investigation before it started. And even if she did clear
  Amy’s name, how long would it take? Weeks? Months? By then, Amy might already be—


  A knock at the door jolted her. Marcus Webb stood there, his usual smirk replaced
  by grim concern. “Heard you got a package,” he said, stepping inside. “You look
  like you’re about to throw up.”


  Sarah exhaled sharply. “I need your help.”


  Marcus crossed his arms. “Then take it. We go to the DA, we leak the full case file,
  we—”


  “And what happens when the judge gets a call from some ‘concerned citizen’ about
  ‘new evidence’?” Sarah snapped. “Or when the prosecution’s star witness suddenly
  ‘changes her story’ because of a little pressure?” She paced again, voice low. “You
  know how this ends, Marcus. It ends with Marchetti walking, and Amy…” She trailed
  off, gripping the counter.


  Marcus studied her, then pulled out his phone. “Then we go to the press. Anonymous
  tip, leaked files, public pressure—”


  “And then what?” Sarah’s laugh was bitter. “They’ll discredit me, call me a liar,
  a vengeful ex-cop. Meanwhile, Marchetti’s lawyers drag this out for years. Amy’s
  still in that warehouse, and I’m stuck watching it on the news.” She met his gaze.
  “I need to move faster than the system can stop me.”


  Marcus’s jaw tightened. “Sarah, you’re talking about going off-grid. One wrong move,
  and you’re dead.”


  “Then I’d better not make any.” She turned away, the weight of the badge in her
  pocket suddenly unbearable. The only way out was to become the one thing the Marchetti
  family feared most: a ghost.'
