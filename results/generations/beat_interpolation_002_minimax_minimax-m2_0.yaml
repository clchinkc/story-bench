output: 'Sarah stared at the photograph pinned to her corkboard—Amy’s face calm and
  alert, despite the rope around her wrists. She traced the outline with her finger,
  then pulled it down. In the quiet of her apartment, options sorted themselves like
  evidence in a case file.


  Option one: Recant. Say she’d misidentified Vincent Marchetti, that the shooting
  was staged, that she’d been wrong. Marchetti walks, Marchetti goes back to running
  the family, and the city gets one more cancer. But Amy lives. The thought tasted
  like copper pennies. Sarah knew the weight of her testimony. Recanting didn’t just
  betray the case; it betrayed the dead men in the warehouse who’d given their names
  to a city that never asked for them.


  Option two: The official channel. Call Morrison. Call the FBI. Request a federal
  protective detail, a relocation, a swap. Ask Marcus to pull strings. She thought
  about her partner’s steadiness and his certainty that rules could be bent around
  the edges when lives were at stake. She dialed him and walked the logic down the
  steps—how fast could a safe house be set up? Would they even believe her without
  evidence? Where would Amy be moved, and who would carry her there? How many people
  would need to be briefed, how many calls logged, how many names typed into a database
  that the Marchettis could access if the mole was the right one? The numbers stacked
  against her. The trial was Monday. Seventy-two hours. The system had beautiful safeguards
  against panic. Sarah was out of time.


  She imagined the conversation with Morrison. The captain would argue for procedure,
  the DA would argue for the case, the bureau would argue for jurisdiction. Somewhere
  in the crossfire, Amy would become a file, and a file was a vulnerable thing. The
  Marchetti family had never been stopped by a warrant or a subpoena. They’d been
  stopped by eyewitnesses and bullet casings. She’d seen how fast the machine ground
  people into dust when the machine didn’t understand urgency.


  Marcus arrived with coffee and his usual easy grin, which faltered when he saw the
  photograph. “We’ll get her back,” he said. “We’ll go to the DA, the feds. We’ll—”


  “They have someone in the department,” Sarah interrupted. “We both know it. We’ve
  been circling it for months and getting nowhere. The minute we put Amy into any
  official channel, we signal our play and get countered. They’ve already shown they
  know when we blink. If I put this in a system that leaks, Amy dies.”


  He stared at the photo. “Then what are you saying? That we do nothing?”


  She didn’t have to say the third option out loud. She saw it forming behind her
  eyes, a parallel track that didn’t intersect with official corridors. A path with
  no forms, no permissions, no time limits but the one she imposed. “I’m saying the
  official channel isn’t going to be fast enough or clean enough for this. And if
  I go through it and it fails, I’m going to have to live with that.”


  Marcus leaned forward. “We don’t leave people behind. That’s not us.”


  “I’m not leaving her,” Sarah said. “I’m changing the game so I can save her without
  breaking the city.”


  He frowned. “You’re talking about going off the rails. You know what that looks
  like.”


  “I know what it looks like to stand up in a courtroom and say a man pulled a trigger
  and have that mean something,” Sarah said. “And I know what it looks like to let
  fear pick the answer for me.” She turned the photograph face-down. “I’m not recanting.
  I’m not waiting for the machine to grind forward and hope Amy is in the hopper at
  the right moment. I’m going to find her. And I’ll do whatever I have to do to make
  sure I can.”


  Marcus nodded, slow. “If you do this alone, it’s dangerous.”


  “It’s already dangerous,” she said. “The question is whether I’m going to be dangerous
  to the right people.”


  He stared at the badge on her belt for a long moment. “What do you need from me?”


  “Cover,” she said. “Until I decide how I’m going to play it. And if you can’t give
  me that without breaking the rules, then I’m going to play it without the rules.”


  He let out a breath. “You’re going to resign.”


  “Not yet,” she said. “I’m going to decide how to save my sister. And if that requires
  me to be something other than a cop, then I’ll be something other than a cop.”


  Marcus put his hand on the table, fingers splayed. “All right,” he said. “But we
  do this by the book as long as we can.”


  Sarah met his gaze. “We’ll see what book we end up in.”


  After he left, she sat with the silence of the apartment. The letter to Morrison
  wasn’t typed yet, but the words were already there, lined up like suspects she’d
  yet to name. She reached for paper and pen, knowing she wasn’t about to quit the
  job. She was about to find a way to save Amy that didn’t require permission.'
