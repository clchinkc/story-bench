  Yuki moved through the station with clinical precision, her scanner sweeping every
  surface like a surgeon''s scalpel. The crew quarters stretched before her in orderly
  rows of identical doors—seven sections, forty-seven crew members, each one assigned.
  She tried the first handle. Locked. All of them locked.


  But the common area told a different story. Coffee cups sat half-finished on tables.
  Data pads lay scattered near comfortable chairs. A game of three-dimensional chess
  remained in progress, white piece mid-move against black. Whatever had happened,
  these people hadn''t expected it.


  She found the first clue in Commander Reyes''s office: research notes dense with
  quantum equations and references to "phase transitions" and "dimensional boundaries."
  The words meant nothing to Yuki yet, but the urgency in Reyes''s handwriting was
  unmistakable. Something had gone wrong with an experiment. Something dangerous.


  The medical bay offered more answers—and its first chill of dread.


  Emergency reports filled the display screens. Patients exhibiting "anomalous neurological
  patterns." Three crew members "no longer responding to standard physical parameters."
  A nurse''s final entry cut off mid-sentence: "They''re still here but they''re not—"
  The screen went blank.


  Yuki''s breath fogged in the dim red light. Her scanner detected life signs—heat
  signatures moving through the ventilation system, too large to be equipment, too
  numerous to be survivors. Forty-seven signatures. All present. All moving.


  A shimmer caught her eye at the corridor''s edge. She turned, raising her scanner
  like a weapon, but the tool registered only interference. The air itself seemed
  to bend, revealing glimpses of something that shouldn''t exist—a human shape stretched
  wrong, eyes that reflected light from angles that didn''t make sense.


  "Not dead," a voice whispered from everywhere and nowhere. "Not gone."


  Yuki ran.


  She sprinted through the station, her scientific mind cataloging the impossibility:
  dimensional echoes, physical manifestations of beings existing between states of
  reality. The transformed crew weren''t ghosts. They were something the research
  had created—something the data core had made possible.


  Her legs burned as she dove through sealing blast doors, cutting herself off from
  the Things that pursued in waves of heat-haze distortion. Lab Seven lay ahead. The
  data core waited.


  She had found what she came for—or at least, the path toward it. Now she only needed
  to survive long enough to take it.'
