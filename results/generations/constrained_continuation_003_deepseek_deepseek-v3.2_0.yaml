output: 'The Collective’s central hub was a pressurized maze of grafted-together modules,
  humming with recycled air and low-grade tension. Jin moved through it, a ghost trailed
  by wary glances and murmured assessments. His notoriety was a currency he didn’t
  know how to spend. The Collectivists weren’t a united front; they were miners, engineers,
  and dissident scientists, each faction orbiting its own interests. Safety here wasn’t
  given; it was negotiated, and Jin was a terrible negotiator.


  His guide was Kael, a gaunt orbital-born with eyes that held the cold, constant
  light of the stars. Kael spoke in pragmatic truths. “They granted you asylum because
  your presence embarrasses Earth,” he explained, leading Jin through a hydroponics
  ring. “But embarrassment has a short half-life. You need to become useful, or you’ll
  become ballast.”


  Jin’s search was twofold: for a place to belong, and for a way to resurrect his
  cause. He offered his expertise, but the Collective’s priorities were immediate—life
  support efficiency, asteroid mineral yields. His grand, planet-saving truth was
  a distant luxury. The familiar situation he’d imagined—a podium among allies—dissolved
  into a grinding struggle for relevance.


  The find came weeks later, not in a lab, but in a forgotten server archive Kael
  accessed with a smirk. “Everything Earth tries to bury washes up here eventually.”
  It was the complete, unredacted dataset behind the suppressed carbon capture tech.
  Jin pored over it, his initial triumph curdling into cold unease. The technology
  worked, brilliantly. But the core catalyst required a rare-earth mineral, Lanthanum-9,
  whose only known large-scale deposit lay beneath a sovereign ocean trench. Full
  deployment would have triggered a global resource war, a scramble that would have
  made the carbon crisis look orderly. The Council hadn’t just suppressed it for profit;
  they’d buried it to prevent a more immediate, violent collapse.


  He found what he thought he wanted when the station’s largest faction, the Pragmatists,
  offered him a deal. They would give him a broadcast platform, a channel to the Free
  Orbitals and any terrestrial listeners brave enough to pirate the signal. He could
  expose the Council’s moral bankruptcy in hiding the tech’s true cost. In return,
  he would publicly endorse the Pragmatists’ vision for the Collective: not as a beacon
  for Earth, but as its detached, independent successor. “We are the future,” their
  leader said. “Help us make that case.”


  It was the platform he’d craved. But the cost was a moral suture, stitching his
  truth to their separatism. He would have to frame Earth’s tragedy as inevitable,
  the Collective’s survival as the only worthy goal. It meant leveraging Yuna’s sacrifice
  and his parents’ peril not to save a world, but to abandon it rhetorically.


  Jin took the deal. He sat before the glowing lens, the script of his amended truth
  on a screen. The first words felt like ash in his mouth, a compromise that tasted
  of betrayal. But the broadcast went live, his voice traveling across the silent
  void. He gained a voice, but paid with a piece of his purpose, now forever entangled
  with a colder, harder hope.'
