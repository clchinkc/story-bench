output: 'The Buckingham''s basement smelled of rust and old concrete. Dante descended
  the crumbling stairs behind Marcus, a Resonant whose gift let him sense the emotional
  weight of spaces. Marcus had made his distrust clear from the moment they met—the
  way his jaw tightened when Dante entered the safe house, the way he kept his back
  deliberately turned.


  "Prove it," Marcus said, gesturing to the darkened corridor. "Show me you can see
  what I see. Show me you''re not here to find us for him."


  The killer. The one who''d hollowed Rosa out.


  Dante closed his eyes and let the colors bloom. Pink streaks of fear clung to the
  walls where Resonants had huddled. Deeper reds—anger, desperation. But there, threading
  through everything: oily black residue that didn''t belong. Corruption. A trail
  of it leading back up the stairs.


  "Someone''s been reporting to him," Dante said quietly. "One of us. That stain—it''s
  the emotional signature of betrayal. Someone who knew we''d be here."


  Marcus spun, and for a moment Dante thought he''d made a terrible mistake. Then
  Marcus''s face hardened with recognition, with anger at his own blindness.


  "That''s how he keeps finding us," Marcus breathed.


  Dante had spent three years rebuilding himself from the wreckage of addiction, learning
  that every craving was just a feeling that would pass, that he could sit with discomfort
  without drowning in it. He used that skill now, holding Marcus''s suspicion steady,
  not flinching from it.


  "I failed someone I loved," Dante said. "My sister. I was too high to see it coming.
  That''s why I know exactly what that black stain means—I wore it for years." He
  met Marcus''s eyes. "I''m not the enemy. And neither are you, if you choose to trust
  me now."


  Marcus finally nodded, the tension in his shoulders releasing. "We''re going after
  him tomorrow night. The old hotel where the Resonants first started gathering. He''s
  been collecting our abilities there, storing them somehow. Rosa was the strongest.
  If we don''t stop him, he''ll eventually have enough power to hunt every one of
  us down."


  Dante felt the weight settle into his chest. That was where Marie had died—two blocks
  from the Buckingham, in an apartment that still radiated her panic and despair when
  he walked past it.


  They moved deeper into the basement, into the warren of rooms Marcus had prepared.
  Maps covered one wall, marked with red circles showing where victims had been found.
  Abandoned buildings. Forgotten places. Each location thrummed with the residue of
  anguished Resonants, their gifts torn away, their emotional cores left hollow.


  "We''ll need to get closer to him than anyone else has," Marcus explained. "He''ll
  sense us the moment we''re near. That gives him seconds to either run or fight."


  Dante studied the maps, his stomach tight with old familiar dread. Not the dull
  ache of withdrawal or craving, but something sharper—the weight of responsibility
  he''d been running from since Marie died.


  "He knows me," Dante said. "Rosa said something before... before she couldn''t anymore.
  She said he''d spoken her name. Said he was waiting for me specifically."


  "That means he''s done his research. Knows your history." Marcus tapped one photo
  with a scarred finger. "This victim was found three days ago. She was a cleaner—she
  could scrub emotional residue from places. The killer forced her to clear the Buckingham.
  Whatever he''s been storing there, he doesn''t want psychic fingerprints."


  Dante looked at the woman''s hollow eyes in the photograph, then at the map. The
  Buckingham was exactly what it sounded like: a threshold into the killer''s world.
  Everything they learned, everything they were building together, would either matter
  or mean nothing once they crossed that line. He thought about Marie''s funeral,
  about the Narcotics Anonymous meeting where he''d finally admitted he couldn''t
  fix the past, only move through it.


  "Tomorrow night then," he said.


  That night, Dante didn''t sleep. He sat on the fire escape of the safe house, watching
  Chicago''s lights blur through the autumn fog. Below, the city thrummed with millions
  of people, most of them unaware that some of their neighbors could see what they
  couldn''t—the emotional wounds the world left behind. Most unaware that something
  was harvesting those wounds like a predator stripping a carcass.


  He thought about walking away. The craving to run was familiar, almost comforting
  in its predictability. He could leave Chicago, start over somewhere else, find a
  new name. But he''d done that already, multiple times. Recovery wasn''t about running
  anymore. It was about staying.


  At dawn, Marcus found him still there.


  "Scared?" Marcus asked.


  "Terrified," Dante admitted. "Not of dying. Of what I''ll feel when I see him."


  When they approached the Buckingham the next evening, the building looked smaller
  than Dante remembered—a gray Art Deco skeleton against the darkening sky. The doors
  hung open like a mouth.


  The entrance was ringed with colors Dante had never seen before: violets and deep
  blues that took him a moment to identify. Grief. Longing. Rosa''s colors, twisted
  into the brick and mortar.


  Marcus touched Dante''s shoulder. "Whatever you feel in there, we face it together."


  They crossed the threshold.


  The lobby was a cathedral of stolen emotion. Abilities hung in the air like captured
  butterflies, their colors muted and wrong. Dante saw them: the clarity of truth-seeing,
  the gold of empathic connection, the silver of precognition. All of it twisted,
  corrupted, siphoned.


  At the center stood the killer, and Dante''s breath stopped.


  He knew that face. Hollow cheeks and hungry eyes. It was Marcus''s twin brother—the
  one he''d told Dante had died five years ago.


  "You came," the killer said, his voice like rusted hinges. "Rosa was beautiful,
  but she wouldn''t tell me about you. Wouldn''t tell me what you could see. But I
  remembered you, Dante. I was the one who introduced your sister to the first dealer.
  I''ve always wondered if you blamed me, or if you blamed yourself more."


  The words hit like a physical force. Dante felt it then—the guilt he''d spent three
  years learning to carry without being crushed by it, suddenly weaponized, suddenly
  unbearable. His knees buckled.


  Marcus started forward, but the killer raised his hand. The stolen abilities writhed
  in response, and Marcus screamed as they descended on him, raking at his mind, tearing
  at everything he was.


  "You can''t stop this," the killer said to Dante. "You already lost. You''re still
  losing. You''ll always lose because you deserve to lose."


  In that moment, something in Dante broke open. Not his will, but his resistance.
  He stopped fighting the guilt. He let it flood through him—all the weight of Marie''s
  death, all the choices he hadn''t made, all the moments he couldn''t reclaim. He
  stopped trying to survive it and instead let it move through him like water through
  a sieve.


  And when he did, the colors around him shifted.


  The killer had never understood Resonants like Dante. He could only steal abilities—that
  external manifestation of what Resonants could do. But Dante''s gift wasn''t in
  seeing colors alone. It was in understanding them. It was in translating emotional
  evidence into truth.


  Dante looked at the twisted abilities hanging in the air and saw their paths. He
  saw where they came from and where they wanted to go. He saw the corruption spreading
  through them like rot, and realized the killer wasn''t just taking abilities—he
  was trying to consume them, to devour the emotional lives of every Resonant he touched,
  looking for something specific.


  Looking for closure about a choice he''d made.


  Marcus lay gasping on the floor, but not dead. Dante reached down and helped him
  up, and in doing so, he broke the killer''s concentration. One fraction of a second.
  One moment where the stolen abilities flickered free.


  Rosa''s colors blazed through the Buckingham.


  Her gift, her connection, her love for the other Resonants—it had never truly been
  stolen because she''d never stopped reaching out even as she was hollowed. Her ability
  to heal had been folded into everything she touched, and now it flooded the room,
  seeking Marcus, seeking Dante, seeking all the fractured pieces the killer had left
  behind.


  The killer screamed as his own collected grief—all the pain he''d been trying to
  drain from others to ease his own loss—came crashing back into him.


  "I didn''t mean to," he sobbed. "I didn''t mean to hurt you. I just wanted to understand
  why you wouldn''t save me like she saved you."


  Dante understood then. The killer had been there that night, five years ago, when
  Marcus had overdosed. And Marcus had lived because of Rosa''s intervention. The
  killer had been someone else—someone Rosa had failed to reach in time.


  Dante knelt beside the man on the floor and didn''t look away from his face. He
  thought of Marie, thought of the countless moments he''d failed her, thought of
  the weight he''d been carrying. He didn''t forgive it—what had happened was unforgivable.
  But he stopped needing the killer to be a monster.


  "I see you," Dante said quietly. "I see your grief. It''s real."


  The moment he spoke those words, the killer''s grip on the stolen abilities released
  completely. They scattered upward like frightened birds, seeking their owners, seeking
  home. The Buckingham filled with light—gold and silver and blue and violet, all
  the colors of people whose pain had finally been witnessed.


  Marcus grabbed Dante''s hand and pulled him toward the door as the killer collapsed,
  finally empty, finally still.


  Outside on the Chicago street, as the sirens approached and the stolen abilities
  drifted back into the city''s hidden places, Dante breathed the cold October air
  and understood that recovery wasn''t about returning to who he''d been before his
  sister died. It was about becoming someone strong enough to carry what he''d lost
  without being destroyed by it.


  And he was.'
