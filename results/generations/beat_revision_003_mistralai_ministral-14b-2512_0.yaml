  Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel, but instead of rushing toward her mother’s waiting car,
  she lingered by the glass doors, watching the planes. The hum of the airport seemed
  different—less a rush to fill time than a reminder of how vast the world was.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they finally pulled onto the highway.


  Sophie exhaled, her fingers no longer twitching toward her phone. "It was beautiful.
  And... quiet." She paused, looking out at the skyline as it emerged through the
  evening haze. "I didn’t check my emails once."


  Her mother glanced at her. "No work?"


  "Not even the Pearson account." Sophie met her gaze, a small smile playing on her
  lips. "I realized something, Mom. Linda’s emergencies aren’t *real* emergencies.
  They’re just her way of making sure I’m still running toward her problems."


  The car hummed between them, the familiar apartment building, the coffee shop where
  she used to buy her morning latte—none of it felt the same. Sophie’s chest was lighter,
  her mind clearer. She’d spent weeks in a temple, learning to sit with discomfort,
  with silence, with the weight of her own thoughts. And now, as the city stretched
  out like a familiar but suddenly strange landscape, she knew she wouldn’t answer
  Linda’s call tonight.


  "It’s good to be home," she said, but this time the words carried a weight the old
  routine never had. Not relief, exactly, but possibility.


  Her mother hummed in response, and for the first time in years, Sophie didn’t pull
  out her phone. Instead, she held the silence, let it settle. The city was still
  there. The coffee shop was still there. But she was different.


  And life, just maybe, could be too.'
