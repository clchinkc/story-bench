output: 'The crew quarters told the first part of the story. Beds unmade, meals half-eaten,
  personal tablets scattered across bunks—all frozen mid-moment. No signs of struggle.
  No blood. Just abandonment so sudden it made Yuki''s skin crawl.


  She documented everything with her scanner, falling into the familiar rhythm of
  scientific observation to steady her nerves. A half-drunk coffee cup, still warm
  to the touch after three days. Impossible. She noted the anomaly and moved on.


  The medical bay was worse. Research notes covered every surface, Commander Reyes''s
  handwriting growing increasingly frantic across the pages. "Dimensional permeability
  achieved... subjects stable in both states... consciousness unaffected but form...
  God, we can''t reverse it..."


  Yuki was photographing the notes when the air beside her shimmered.


  She spun. Nothing. Just empty space. Then the shimmer again, accompanied by a sound
  like whispered static. The temperature dropped ten degrees in an instant.


  More shimmers materialized throughout the bay—human-shaped distortions in reality
  itself, surrounding her. Her scanner shrieked warnings about unstable quantum fluctuations.
  When she moved toward the door, the shimmers blocked her path. Not hostile exactly,
  but insistent.


  "What do you want?" Her voice came out steadier than she felt.


  The shimmers pulsed in unison, and suddenly her scanner displayed a cascade of data—coordinates,
  lab designations, access codes. They were trying to communicate, pushing information
  directly into her devices.


  Lab Seven. They wanted her to go to Lab Seven.


  Yuki made herself breathe. Made herself think. If these had been the crew, and they
  wanted her to find something rather than flee...


  She squared her shoulders and stepped forward. The shimmers parted, then flowed
  around her like an ethereal escort, leading her deeper into the station''s research
  wing where the answers—and the horror—awaited.'
