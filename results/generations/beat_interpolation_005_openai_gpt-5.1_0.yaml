output: 'The storm broke just after midnight, sudden sheets of rain hammering the
  terracotta roof. The staff had gone hours ago. Only the low hum of the industrial
  refrigerator kept Maya company as she wrapped herbs and labeled containers for the
  next day.


  Alejandro’s dinner tray sat untouched on the counter. Perfect sea bream, crisp potatoes,
  fennel salad—cold now, congealed. For the third night in a row.


  She was scraping the plate when a soft clatter came from the far end of the kitchen.
  A pan, metal on tile, followed by a muttered curse in Spanish.


  Maya rounded the prep island and stopped.


  Alejandro stood at the stove in bare feet and a faded training shirt, a frying pan
  in one hand, a carton of eggs in the other. The overhead light made the pale line
  of a long scar along his calf stand out, a rope of tissue that disappeared beneath
  the hem of his shorts. His right hand shook almost imperceptibly as he tried to
  crack an egg one-handed against the rim.


  “Stop right there,” he said without looking up. “I know what you’re thinking.”


  “That you’re murdering a perfectly innocent egg?” The words slipped out before she
  could stop them.


  He glanced at her then, caught between annoyance and reluctant amusement. “I used
  to be good at this. Twelve years in locker rooms. We cooked for ourselves.”


  Her gaze dropped again to the scar, to the brace peeking under the table. “What
  happened to your leg? Really.”


  He hesitated, then set the pan down with a sigh. “A defender slid in late. My knee
  went one way, the rest of me another.” A tiny shrug. “The surgery…went badly. Nerve
  damage. Some days it listens. Some days—” He held up his traitorous hand.


  It was more than a statistic on a sports site, more than a career-ending injury.
  It was the way he said it: matter-of-fact, like he’d rehearsed the words until they
  cost him nothing. Except they clearly still did.


  “Come sit,” she said softly. “I’ll cook. You supervise. You can critique my egg
  technique.”


  “I don’t mix with staff in the kitchen,” he said, almost automatically.


  “But you already are.” She nudged a stool toward him. After a moment, he sank onto
  it, the motion cautious, controlled.


  “What were you trying to make?” she asked, opening the fridge.


  He hesitated. “Tortilla. My mother’s. She made it on nights like this, when it rained
  so hard the TV signal died and we had to talk to each other.” His mouth curved briefly.
  “I haven’t had it since…before.”


  “Then let’s make your mother’s tortilla.” She pulled out potatoes, onions, eggs.
  “Tell me how she did it.”


  As she sliced, he talked: thin, always thinner, until you could almost see through
  the potatoes. Low heat, never rushing the onions. Salt “like the sea, not like the
  stadium concessions,” which made him huff out an unexpected laugh. His voice grew
  looser, his Spanish slipping into softer Andalusian vowels.


  Maya listened, adjusting the flame when he told her to, letting him direct. The
  kitchen, usually her kingdom, became for one hour a shared country, the two of them
  moving in an easy, tentative orbit. Their shoulders brushed once when she reached
  past him for the olive oil. Neither of them stepped away.


  When she poured the eggs over the softened potatoes, he leaned in close, watching
  the edges set. She could feel his breath near her temple, warm and steady.


  “You’re folding too early,” he murmured.


  “Then do it,” she said, and without thinking, closed her fingers over his to guide
  the pan.


  His hand steadied under hers. Together they flipped the tortilla onto a plate with
  a perfect, golden thud.


  They ate at the stainless-steel prep table, side by side on mismatched stools, forks
  scraping lightly. Rain battered the windows. The tortilla was simple, humble, somehow
  exactly right.


  “It tastes like my mother’s,” he said quietly.


  “High praise,” she teased, but the words lodged in her chest.


  He looked at her then, really looked, something unguarded breaking through. “I haven’t
  let anyone cook for me like this. Not…for me, not for appearances, not for sponsors.”
  His jaw flexed. “They all wanted a piece of the story. The legend. The disaster.
  You just yell at my eggs.”


  “I’m not here for your story,” Maya said. She realized as she said it that it was
  only half true now. “I’m here for your food. For you to eat more than coffee and
  protein bars.”


  “And after six months?” His tone was light, but there was a question buried in it.
  “You disappear with your money, and I go back to murdering eggs?”


  She thought of her grandmother’s restaurant, of the ledger’s red numbers. Then she
  thought of him alone in this vast house, trying and failing to recreate a memory
  at midnight.


  She could leave when the contract ended. That had always been the plan.


  “I don’t know what happens after,” she said slowly. “But I know this: I’m not just
  going to feed you and keep my head down until I get paid. I’m going to make you
  eat properly, and sit at a table, and remember things that make you smile, even
  when it rains.” She met his eyes, heat rising in her face. “Whether you want to
  or not.”


  A corner of his mouth lifted. “That sounds suspiciously like a threat.”


  “Consider it a…commitment.” The word surprised her with its weight.


  He studied her for a long moment, something like gratitude flickering across his
  features before he masked it. “Then I suppose I’m committed too. To not firing you
  the next time you insult my cooking.”


  Lightning flashed outside, briefly turning the kitchen into a photograph: two people
  at a metal table, a half-eaten tortilla between them, distance shrinking by inches.


  In that instant, Maya understood that the job had quietly become something else.
  Saving the restaurant still mattered. But so did this man with the ruined knee and
  careful voice,'
