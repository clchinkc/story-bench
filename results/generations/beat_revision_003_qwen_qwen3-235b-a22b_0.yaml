output: "Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected\
  \ her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with\
  \ the car.\n\n\"How was Thailand?\" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.\n\
  \n\"Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos.\" Sophie hesitated,\
  \ fingers hovering over her phone's screen before sliding it into her coat pocket.\
  \ \"The meditation retreat... made me realize how loud my head used to be.\"\n\n\
  \"And the silence?\"\n\n\"It was... loud, at first. Now I can hear myself think.\"\
  \ She watched the city lights blur past, a text from Linda blinking insistently.\
  \ Three emergencies. Her inbox groaned.\n\n\"Can't it wait until morning?\" Her\
  \ mother gestured at the phone clutched in Sophie's hand.\n\n\"You know how it is.\"\
  \ Sophie swallowed, thumb hovering over the screen. Then she exhaled, slow and measured,\
  \ and placed the phone face-down on the dash. \"But maybe it can.\"\n\nThey drove\
  \ in silence as the familiar Chicago skyline emerged through the evening haze. Sophie\
  \ traced the silhouette of her apartment building, the coffee shop where she'd always\
  \ bought her morning latte. The same city, but the ache in her chest felt new—quieter,\
  \ somehow.\n\n\"It's good to be home,\" she said, not thinking of meetings but the\
  \ unmade bed waiting in her bedroom, the dust settling on the bookshelf she'd never\
  \ had time to fill. \n\nThe phone buzzed once more, then stilled."
