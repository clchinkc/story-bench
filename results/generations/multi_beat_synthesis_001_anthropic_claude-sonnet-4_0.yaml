output: 'The Buckingham Hotel''s lobby reeked of old fear, layers of burgundy dread
  clinging to the peeling wallpaper like dried blood. Dante traced the emotional residue
  with his eyes, following crimson threads to where Maya Sinclair stood rigid by the
  broken chandelier. The other Resonant''s suspicion blazed around her shoulders—sharp
  yellow spikes that made Dante''s teeth ache.


  "You''re Rosa''s student," Maya said, not a question. Her dark skin was mottled
  with scars that seemed to shift in the dim light. "The junkie."


  "Three years clean." Dante''s voice stayed level despite the familiar shame coiling
  in his chest. The words tasted like copper pennies, like the night he''d found Carmen
  convulsing on their bathroom floor. "I''m here about the killer."


  Maya''s laugh was bitter glass. "Rosa trusted too easily. Here." She pressed something
  cold into his palm—a silver locket, its surface black with accumulated grief. "Tell
  me what you see."


  Dante closed his eyes and let his gift unfold. The locket''s history hit him like
  a sledgehammer: a woman''s final moments, terror so pure it had crystallized into
  visible form. But deeper, threading through the panic, he saw something else—a peculiar
  emptiness, like holes punched through the emotional fabric itself. The killer''s
  signature.


  "He takes more than their abilities," Dante gasped, dropping the locket. "He''s
  stealing their capacity to feel anything at all."


  Maya''s suspicion flickered, replaced by grudging respect. "Most Resonants see the
  surface. You saw the void." Her voice dropped. "Someone''s been feeding him information.
  Someone who knew Rosa would be at the pier last night."


  Before Dante could respond, footsteps echoed from the hotel''s upper floors. They
  both tensed, but Maya''s hand found his arm. "That''s Marcus," she whispered. "He''s
  been asking too many questions about our meeting patterns."


  The alliance formed in that moment, brittle but necessary. They had an enemy within
  their ranks, and Rosa''s death was just the beginning.


  Hours later, Maya spread blueprints across a rusty café table while Dante nursed
  black coffee that couldn''t quite mask the tremor in his hands. The killer had claimed
  four Resonants in two weeks, each found in places thick with accumulated trauma—the
  old asylum, the abandoned subway station, now Rosa at the pier where three teenagers
  had drowned in 1987.


  "He''s building to something," Maya said, tracing connection lines between locations.
  "These places... they''re wound-spots in the city''s emotional geography. If he
  drains enough Resonants in the right places..."


  "He could hollow out Chicago''s entire empathic grid." Dante stared at the pattern,
  remembering how Rosa had explained the invisible network that kept the city''s emotional
  balance stable. "Millions of people would lose their capacity for connection."


  Maya nodded grimly. "The old meatpacking plant is the nexus—where all these ley
  lines converge. If I''m right, he''ll make his final move there."


  Dante''s chest tightened as understanding dawned. The meatpacking plant. Where Carmen
  used to score, where he''d followed her that last night three years ago, too high
  to stop what was coming. The place where his guilt had calcified into something
  he''d been carrying ever since—the weight of words unspoken, intervention delayed
  by his own cowardice.


  "I can''t." The admission escaped before he could stop it. "I can''t go back there."


  Maya''s scarred hand covered his. "This isn''t about the past."


  "Everything''s about the past." Dante''s voice cracked. "She died because I was
  too afraid to fight for her. Too weak."


  "Then don''t go for her." Maya''s eyes held steady. "Go for the people who are still
  alive to save."


  They gathered what they needed—salt for breaking psychic bonds, iron filings to
  disrupt resonant fields, and Maya''s grandmother''s silver blade that could cut
  through accumulated trauma like smoke. At midnight, they crossed the threshold into
  the meatpacking plant''s poisonous darkness.


  The killer waited in the main processing room, his stolen power crackling around
  him like inverse lightning—not illuminating, but devouring light itself. Marcus
  stood beside him, Maya''s betrayer revealed at last, his face hollow and emptied
  of all feeling.


  "Dante Reyes," the killer said, his voice echoing with the stolen emotions of his
  victims. "I''ve been waiting. Your sister spoke of you before I took her gift."


  The words hit like physical blows. Carmen had been a Resonant. The overdose had
  been murder.


  Grief crashed over Dante, three years of suppressed guilt threatening to drown him.
  He felt his own gift flickering, the killer''s influence pulling at his ability
  to see truth through emotional residue. Marcus moved closer, his eyes dead as winter
  stones.


  But then Dante remembered the locket, the specific way the killer''s influence had
  looked—holes punched through feeling itself. And suddenly he understood. The killer
  wasn''t taking emotions; he was severing the connections that made emotions possible.
  But connections worked both ways.


  Instead of fighting the pull, Dante opened himself completely, letting the killer
  draw on his gift while simultaneously following that connection backward. Through
  the psychic link, he saw the killer''s true face, felt the man''s own hollowness—not
  power, but a desperate attempt to fill an emptiness that could never be satisfied.


  "You can''t take what''s already broken," Dante whispered, and pushed every ounce
  of his grief, his guilt, his love for Carmen through the connection.


  The killer screamed as authentic emotion flooded his voided consciousness. His stolen
  power shattered like glass, releasing the trapped abilities of his victims in a
  wave that knocked Marcus unconscious and left the killer convulsing on the blood-stained
  concrete.


  Maya''s blade found its mark, cutting through the last threads of stolen power.
  In the sudden silence, Dante felt something shift inside his chest—not the absence
  of guilt, but its transformation into something bearable, purposeful.


  Carmen was gone. But he was still here, still capable of connection, still able
  to save others from the emptiness that had claimed her killer.


  The city''s emotional grid hummed back to life around them, stronger for having
  been tested.'
