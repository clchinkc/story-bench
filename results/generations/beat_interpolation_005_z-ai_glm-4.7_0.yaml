output: 'The villa was silent at two in the morning, a sleeping beast of stone and
  shadow. Maya couldn’t sleep, her mind racing with conversion rates and menu plans.
  She found herself in the industrial kitchen, chopping onions for a simple *sofrito*.
  It was a comfort dish, the smell of her childhood, grounding her in a house that
  felt too much like a museum.


  The soft scuff of a cane on tile made her freeze. Alejandro stood in the doorway,
  silhouetted against the hallway light. He wore a terry cloth robe, his face gray
  with exhaustion, looking less like a legend and more like a weary old man.


  "I didn''t mean to disturb you," he said, his voice lacking its usual sharp edge.
  "I came for ice. My knee."


  "It flares up in the damp," she observed, not a question. She pointed to the freezer.
  "Help yourself."


  He moved stiffly, wincing as he leaned against the counter. The aroma of garlic
  and tomatoes began to fill the space, warm and inviting. He inhaled deeply, his
  expression softening. "It smells like... Seville. Before the stadiums. Before the
  noise."


  Maya hesitated, then pushed a small bowl of the simmering sauce toward him. "Taste
  it. It’s not on the approved menu."


  He looked at her, really looked at her, for the first time without suspicion. He
  dipped a spoon, tasted, and something in his face cracked open—a profound, aching
  nostalgia. "My mother cooked this on Sundays. The whole neighborhood would be in
  the street."


  They stood there in the yellow glow of the under-cabinet lights, the reclusive billionaire
  and the chef hired to save her business. He wasn''t a client anymore; he was just
  a lonely man nursing an old injury and older ghosts.


  "I can make this for you," Maya said softly, the realization settling over her like
  a warm blanket. "Not because it''s in the contract, but because you need it."


  Alejandro ate another spoonful, his shoulders dropping an inch. "I haven''t had
  a home-cooked meal in ten years, Maya. Just staff and service. It’s... quiet here."


  In that moment, the looming figure of two million euros and her grandmother’s debts
  faded into the background. The stakes shifted irrevocably. She wasn''t just cooking
  for a paycheck; she was cooking to feed a soul that had been starving for a decade.
  She realized she wanted to be the one to bring him back to the world, regardless
  of the timeline.


  "Then sit down," she said, turning up the heat under the pan. "I''m making you a
  proper dinner. And I''m not leaving until you''ve had seconds."'
