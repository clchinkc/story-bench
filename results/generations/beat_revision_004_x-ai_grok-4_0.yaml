output: 'Rachel Torres rubbed her eyes as she sipped black coffee in her small Queens
  apartment, the faint strains of Miles Davis drifting from the old record player.
  Sherlock, her sleek black cat, wound around her ankles, purring insistently for
  breakfast. She knelt to fill his bowl, a soft smile breaking through her focus—two
  years ago, she''d scooped him from the chaos of a ransacked apartment during a burglary
  investigation, unable to leave the tiny survivor behind. "Still solving mysteries,
  huh?" she murmured, scratching his ears before grabbing her badge and coat.


  By the time she reached the Riverside Precinct, the October chill had sharpened
  the Tuesday morning air. The station buzzed with the usual mix: officers chatting
  about a spike in property thefts amid the neighborhood''s blend of brownstones and
  high-rises, where economic woes hit working families hardest. Rachel nodded to a
  few colleagues, her mind already drifting to the file on her desk—a cold case from
  twelve years back, the kind that gnawed at her like an unsolved puzzle. She''d pored
  over it last night, her instincts flaring at a overlooked detail in the witness
  statements, the same way her father''s old case files had hooked her into this life
  after his retirement.


  Detective James Oyelaran looked up from his own stack of reports as she approached,
  his easy grin a familiar anchor after three years of partnership. "Morning, Torres.
  You get any sleep, or did that ''89 homicide keep you up again?" He slid her a fresh
  coffee, black just like she preferred.


  Rachel settled in, flipping open the folder. "Sleep''s overrated. Check this—victim''s
  timeline doesn''t match the neighbor''s account. Feels off." James leaned over,
  scanning the page with a nod of respect. "After all this time together, I know that
  glint in your eye means we''re onto something. Let''s run it down."


  She''d chosen this path over everything else—a broken engagement at twenty-eight
  had sealed her devotion to the badge, leaving no room for distractions. The precinct
  hummed with steady rhythm, crime rates holding firm despite the uptick in thefts,
  a status quo she''d fought to maintain. But as the phone on her desk rang that Tuesday
  morning in October, everything was about to change.'
