output: 'The photograph had lived on Rachel Torres''s kitchen table for three weeks
  now—a grainy surveillance still from a bodega robbery gone wrong, 2019. The case
  was officially closed, unsolved, but something in the victim''s frozen expression
  kept pulling her back.


  Sherlock jumped onto the table, his orange tail sweeping across the scattered files.
  Rachel lifted him away from the evidence out of habit, scratching behind his ears
  where the old scar tissue puckered his fur.


  "You''d make a terrible witness," she murmured.


  Her phone buzzed. James.


  "Torres. You seeing this weather? I''m picking up coffee—the usual?"


  "Black. And grab me one of those—"


  "Almond croissants. I know. Twelve years and your breakfast order''s the only thing
  that hasn''t changed." A pause. "You''re looking at the Mendez file again, aren''t
  you?"


  She didn''t answer, which was answer enough.


  "Rach. It''s six-thirty in the morning on a Tuesday in October. We''ve got actual
  open cases."


  "I''ll be there in twenty."


  Outside her Queens apartment window, the sky hung low and gray over the neighborhood—cramped
  brick buildings giving way to the distant Manhattan skyline. Rachel gathered the
  photographs, filed them in the folder she kept separate from precinct records, and
  reached for her jacket.


  Sherlock watched from the kitchen counter with that knowing look he''d carried since
  the night she found him hiding under a victim''s bed, the only living witness to
  something he''d never tell.


  "Hold down the fort," she said.


  The Riverside Precinct was waiting. So was whatever this Tuesday would bring.'
