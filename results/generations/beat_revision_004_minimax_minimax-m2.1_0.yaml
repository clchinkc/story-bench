output: 'Detective Rachel Torres arrived at Riverside Precinct at 7:12 AM, a paper
  cup of black coffee in one hand and a cold case file under her arm. The building
  held the particular silence of a Tuesday morning before the shift change chaos—ten
  minutes of quiet she protected like a ritual.


  Her desk sat near the window where morning light caught the dust motes floating
  above a cardboard box. Inside, a tabby cat named Sherlock blinked at her slowly,
  then settled back into his blankets. She''d brought him home from a hoarding scene
  two years ago, the only kitten who''d survived. He''d become her morning sentinel,
  watching her work with the patience of something that had already seen the worst
  of human neglect.


  James Oyelaran was already at his desk across from hers, sorting case photos into
  neat stacks. He didn''t look up when she set a second coffee beside his keyboard.
  Three years of partnership had worn their interactions smooth—no words needed for
  the rituals that made a partnership function.


  Twelve years on the force had taught her to read precinct atmosphere the way sailors
  read water. She knew which desks held restless energy, which officers carried cases
  too close to their chests. Her reputation for cold cases preceded her, though she''d
  never sought it. Some mysteries simply refused to let go.


  Her father had walked these same hallways before retiring, his stories lighting
  the path she''d follow. She''d traded a wedding ring for a badge, a broken engagement
  at twenty-eight channeled entirely into work. Her Queens apartment held only what
  served a solitary life: jazz records, coffee maker, and a door that opened for no
  one.


  The Riverside Precinct served a neighborhood of sharp contrasts—brownstones and
  tenements sharing the same cracked sidewalks. Crime statistics showed stability
  overall, but property crimes crept upward as economic pressure found its outlet.


  Sherlick stretched, unimpressed with the coming day.'
