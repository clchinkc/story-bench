output: 'Kenji Nakamura stood alone in his pristine corner office, watching Tokyo''s
  skyline through rain-streaked glass. Twenty years building this company from nothing,
  and now the hostile takeover was complete. His desk sat empty, cleared out, his
  nameplate already removed. At fifty-two, he had a wife who''d left when he chose
  work over family, a daughter who sent birthday cards with no return address, and
  nothing to show for his sacrifices but a severance package and an apartment that
  felt like a museum.


  The letter from Yuki arrived on a Tuesday. His estranged daughter was getting married
  in a small village in Kyoto where she''d been living. She wanted him to walk her
  down the aisle. "I know we don''t talk," she wrote. "But Mom''s gone now, and I
  don''t want to do this alone."


  Kenji stared at the letter for three days. He barely knew her anymore. What right
  did he have to play father now? But there was nothing keeping him in Tokyo. He took
  the train to Kyoto.


  The village moved at a different rhythm. Yuki was polite but distant, letting him
  help with wedding preparations. He was terrible at it—fumbling with flowers, mixing
  up vendor orders. Through it all, he met Haruki, an elderly craftsman who made traditional
  bamboo crafts in a workshop that smelled of cedar and time. The old man showed Kenji
  how to weave bamboo, his gnarled hands patient. "A good craft takes years," Haruki
  said. "Like growing bamboo. You cannot rush what must root deeply."


  Kenji found himself sleeping better than he had in years, waking to mountain air
  instead of traffic noise. He watched Yuki move through the village with easy confidence,
  greeting neighbors, laughing with her fiancé. She''d built a life here—complete,
  rooted, nothing like the frantic Tokyo existence he''d forced on their family.


  At the summer festival, Yuki introduced him to her fiancé''s family. Lanterns swayed
  overhead as Kenji watched his daughter serve tea with practiced grace, translating
  between Japanese and English, making everyone comfortable. For the first time, he
  truly saw her as an adult—capable, loved, complete without him. Perhaps he could
  slip back into her life, be part of this world she''d created.


  Then the investors found him. Old business rivals with a proposal—back him in a
  new venture, leverage his reputation to build something bigger than before. The
  familiar pull of ambition, the architecture of deals and strategy he understood
  so well. He told them he''d consider it.


  Yuki discovered the business cards in his room while bringing fresh towels. Her
  face went cold. "You haven''t changed," she said quietly. "You''re still choosing
  ambition over people. I thought maybe—but no. You can''t walk me down the aisle.
  I don''t want you at the wedding."


  Kenji sat alone in the inn that night, Haruki''s bamboo basketwork on the windowsill.
  Every choice he''d made had led here—alone, unwanted, unable to fix what he''d broken.
  He thought of the investors'' offer, the familiar shape of success he knew how to
  grasp. Then he thought of Yuki''s face, how she''d looked serving tea at the festival—happy
  without him.


  He called the investors at dawn. Declined the deal. Then he went to find Yuki, not
  to change her mind, but to apologize without conditions. She listened, arms crossed.
  "I understand if you don''t want me there," he said. "You were right about everything."


  On the wedding day, Kenji stayed outside the venue, watching through the garden
  gate as Yuki walked the aisle alone, radiant in white silk. Afterward, she found
  him there. "You stayed," she said. "You''re my daughter. I should have stayed years
  ago." They didn''t embrace, didn''t promise anything. But she nodded, and it was
  something—a beginning.


  Back in Tokyo, Kenji opened a small bamboo craft shop. His apartment was no longer
  a museum. Plants lined the windowsill, handmade bowls held his meals, and a photo
  of Yuki at her wedding sat on the shelf. He was alone, but no longer empty, his
  hands learning the patience of roots growing deep.'
