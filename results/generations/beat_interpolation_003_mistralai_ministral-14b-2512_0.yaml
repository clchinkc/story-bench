  Yuki’s scanner flickered as she moved through the narrow corridors of Station Prometheus,
  its red glow cutting through the suffocating dark. The crew quarters were her first
  stop—standard protocol. But the doors were sealed, their biometric locks still active
  despite the silence. She ran diagnostics; the system registered no life signs, yet
  the energy signatures were erratic, pulsing faintly in the walls like a heartbeat
  that wasn’t quite a heartbeat. A whisper slithered past her—too fast, too fluid
  to be air. She spun, scanner slashed into the darkness, but nothing materialized.
  Just another empty hallway.


  The medical bay was next. Blood pressure cuffs dangled from broken consoles, their
  screens frozen in mid-alert. Hypodermic needles lay scattered, syringes half-empty
  with a substance that had crystallized into jagged shards under the cold lights.
  A patient log glitched repeatedly, showing the same final entry—*"Subject 47: stable.
  Dimensional integration successful."* Yuki’s stomach twisted. Integration? Not a
  cure. Not a treatment. The words didn’t make sense. She pulled up the station’s
  environmental records, searching for anomalies. Three days ago, the oxygen mix had
  shifted—trace amounts of an unknown compound spiked before the systems stabilized.
  Then the blackout. Then… whatever this was.


  In the mess hall, the table was set for a meal, utensils still warm. A single cup
  of tea sat untouched, steam curling in unnatural spirals. The scent was wrong—sweet
  and metallic, like ozone over copper. Yuki’s fingers brushed the rim; the porcelain
  vibrated, not from heat, but from something *inside* it. A shape flickered beneath
  her touch, dissolving into the air before she could focus. She recoiled, scanner
  spitting static. "What the hell—?"


  The power flickered. Alarms blared. She dropped into a crouch, watching as the walls
  themselves seemed to *breathe*, the steel expanding and contracting in slow, deliberate
  waves. The core’s location was on her tablet, but the backup generators were failing—they’d
  been sabotaged. Not by people. By *it*. Whatever was left of Reyes’s crew had altered
  the station’s structure, turning machinery against itself to keep her out.


  Yuki’s pulse roared in her ears. She couldn’t afford to panic. The data core was
  her target, and the station was still holding. If she could get there before the
  systems collapsed entirely, maybe she could—


  A shadow detached from the ceiling, formless at first, then coalescing into something
  resembling a human. Or what a human *used* to be. Its edges shimmered like light
  through water, and its voice was a chorus of overlapping whispers: *"You shouldn’t
  be here."* Yuki raised her scanner, the beam catching the thing mid-step. It recoiled,
  dissolving into the corridor like smoke in a draft, but the air smelled of it now—burnt
  hair, antiseptic, something *wet*. The message was clear: they knew she was here,
  and they didn’t want her to stay. But they weren’t stopping by force. Not yet.


  She exhaled, steadying her hands. Whatever they were, they’d once been people. People
  who’d trusted her. People who might still trust a part of her, if she could just—


  A panel slid shut in front of her, sealing the corridor with a hiss. Yuki’s breath
  fogged the scanner’s lens as she cursed. The station wasn’t just sabotaging itself;
  it was *guiding* her. Towards danger. Or away. She didn’t know which.


  But she knew the core was still out there. Somewhere.


  And she would find it.'
