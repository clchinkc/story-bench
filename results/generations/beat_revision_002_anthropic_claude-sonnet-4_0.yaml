output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  Marcus looked up hopefully, but her expression crushed what little optimism remained.
  "Actually, Marcus, I need to tell you something. The board met yesterday. Without
  you." She shifted uncomfortably. "They voted. No more fundraising. No more appeals.
  They think it''s time to cut losses and move on."


  "What?" The word came out as a whisper.


  "I''m sorry. I tried to argue for you, but..." She gathered her things. "They offered
  me the director position at the North Side Center. I start Monday."


  The room spun. His own board. His own assistant. Fifteen years, and they were walking
  away like it meant nothing.


  He rubbed his temples, trying to think, but there was nothing left. The grant application
  had been denied that morning—he''d been too shocked to mention it. The city had
  already rezoned the property. Every other suitable building in the area had been
  bought up by the same developer.


  His phone buzzed. A text from his wife: "The lawyer called. We lost the house appeal
  too. Kids are asking why Daddy looks so sad."


  Marcus stared at the empty room—his life''s work reduced to boxes and broken dreams.
  The kids who depended on him would scatter to the streets. His family faced homelessness.
  His team had abandoned him.


  He was utterly alone, holding the fragments of everything he''d tried to build.'
