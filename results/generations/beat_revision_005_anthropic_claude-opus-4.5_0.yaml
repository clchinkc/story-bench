  This segment executes the Dark Night of the Soul beat effectively. It meets all
  key requirements: Maya is isolated (alone in darkness, brother won''t answer calls),
  reflecting on genuine failure rather than surface sadness, sitting with despair
  without reaching for solutions ("There was nothing left to do"), and the "whiff
  of death" is present through the hospice memory and the mother''s painting of a
  figure walking toward an "unseen horizon"—subtle mortality imagery. The line "she
  let herself break" captures the essential quality of this beat: wallowing in defeat
  before any breakthrough can occur. The emotional weight of the broken deathbed promise
  adds meaningful depth to the despair.'
