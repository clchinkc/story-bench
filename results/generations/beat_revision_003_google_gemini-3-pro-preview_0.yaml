output: "Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected\
  \ her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with\
  \ the car.\n\n\"How was Thailand?\" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.\n\
  \n\"Amazing. The temples were beautiful,\" Sophie said, watching the gray tarmac\
  \ blur past. \"But the silence was the loudest part.\"\n\n\"And the meditation retreat?\"\
  \n\n\"It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly.\" Sophie’s phone buzzed in her\
  \ hand. The screen lit up with a barrage of notifications—seventy-three unread emails\
  \ and three urgent messages from Linda about the Pearson account. The old panic\
  \ flared in her chest, sharp and familiar, an instinct to apologize and fix immediately.\n\
  \n\"Everything okay?\" her mother glanced at the phone.\n\nSophie stared at the\
  \ screen. Before the trip, she would have already been typing, her heart rate matching\
  \ the frantic pace of the highway. But she remembered the monk in Chiang Mai, the\
  \ feeling of breath entering and leaving her lungs, the realization that the sky\
  \ didn't fall just because she wasn't holding it up.\n\n\"Three emergencies while\
  \ I was gone,\" Sophie said softly. \"Linda thinks she needs me to call her tonight.\"\
  \n\n\"Can't it wait until morning?\"\n\nSophie held down the power button. The screen\
  \ went black. She slid the phone into her bag and zipped it shut.\n\n\"Yes,\" Sophie\
  \ breathed out, her shoulders dropping two inches. \"The Pearson account will manage\
  \ itself for twelve more hours.\"\n\nThey drove in comfortable silence for a while.\
  \ The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through the evening haze. It looked the\
  \ same—the rigid steel, the frantic grid of lights—but Sophie didn't feel the usual\
  \ constriction in her throat looking at it. \n\n\"It's good to be home,\" she said,\
  \ and for the first time in years, she meant the rest, not the work."
