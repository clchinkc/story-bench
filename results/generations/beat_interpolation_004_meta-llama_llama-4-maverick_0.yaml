output: 'Thomas''s eyes locked onto Dr. Okonkwo as she began to testify, her voice
  barely above a whisper. He watched as her words spilled out like a confession, the
  weight of her secrets slowly crushing her. The courtroom was a pressure cooker,
  and Thomas was the safety valve, but he couldn''t just sit idly by. He reached out,
  his hand enveloping hers in a firm grip.


  "Dr. Okonkwo, please," he said, his voice low and urgent. "You don''t have to do
  this alone."


  Dr. Okonkwo''s gaze snapped up, her eyes red-rimmed as she searched his face. For
  a moment, Thomas thought he saw a glimmer of determination, and then she took a
  deep breath. "I''ll tell the truth," she said, her voice firming. "I''ll tell them
  everything."


  As she spoke, her words painted a picture of deceit and corruption, the courtroom
  seemed to hold its collective breath. Thomas watched, his heart pounding in his
  chest, as the weight of her testimony settled over the room like a shroud. The air
  was thick with tension, the outcome hanging precariously in the balance.


  Dr. Okonkwo''s voice cracked as she described the documents she had hidden, the
  evidence she had uncovered, and the lies she had told to cover her tracks. Thomas
  felt a surge of pride and admiration for the woman who had faced her fears and come
  forward. He stood up, his eyes locked on Dr. Okonkwo, and began to question her,
  his voice firm and steady.


  The courtroom erupted into a flurry of activity as the prosecution and defense teams
  scrambled to respond to the bombshell testimony. Thomas''s heart raced as he watched
  Dr. Okonkwo''s composure begin to crumble, her words tumbling out in a rush as she
  revealed the full extent of Meridian''s malfeasance. The room was a maelstrom of
  noise and chaos, but Thomas''s focus was fixed on Dr. Okonkwo, his eyes burning
  with intensity as he willed her to keep going, to tell the truth no matter the cost.


  In that moment, Thomas knew that the trial had reached its turning point. The outcome
  was far from certain, but one thing was clear: nothing would ever be the same again.
  As Dr. Okonkwo finished her testimony, the courtroom fell silent, the only sound
  the quiet rustle of papers and the soft murmur of the spectators. Thomas''s gaze
  never wavered, his eyes locked on Dr. Okonkwo''s face, as he waited for the verdict.'
