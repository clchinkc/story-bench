output: 'The passage Tomás led her through narrowed until Zara had to turn sideways,
  stone scraping her shoulders. Behind them, shouts echoed. The Scorpion Guild was
  close.


  The tunnel opened into a chamber with three exits. Tomás started toward the middle
  passage, then stumbled with a cry. His leg vanished into the floor—a pit trap, barely
  visible in the torchlight.


  "Go!" he gasped, clinging to the edge. "You can still make it!"


  Zara hesitated at the threshold of the right passage, freedom beckoning. Her mother''s
  wasting face flashed through her mind. But Tomás''s fingers were slipping.


  She cursed and dropped to her knees beside him. Years of picking pockets had made
  her fingers quick. She unhooked the rope from her belt, looped it around an outcropping,
  and hauled him up just as footsteps thundered behind them.


  They scrambled into the left passage—the only one remaining.


  It descended sharply. Ancient glyphs marked the walls, and Tomás''s expression shifted
  from gratitude to something hungrier.


  "I need to tell you something," he said as they descended. "About why I''m really
  here."


  Zara''s hand found her knife.


  "The Sunken Library doesn''t just hold medical texts. There''s a manuscript—the
  Book of Undoing. It can reverse any scholarly condemnation. My reputation, my position
  at the Academy... I could have everything back." He met her eyes. "I wasn''t lying
  about knowing the route. But I also need something from that library."


  "We''re both thieves, then," Zara said flatly. But the betrayal still stung. She''d
  thought, maybe, she''d found someone who understood.


  The passage ended at a massive door carved with warnings. The Approach.


  Tomás read the inscriptions: "Beyond lies the Trial of Worth. Only those willing
  to surrender what they cannot bear to lose may enter."


  The door''s lock was unlike anything Zara had seen—a mechanism of bronze and bone,
  impossibly intricate. She studied it, sweat beading on her forehead. This wasn''t
  just picking a lock. This required understanding.


  Her fingers trembled. What if she couldn''t do this? What if all her skills, all
  her determination, weren''t enough? Her mother would die, and it would be because
  Zara had failed.


  The fear paralyzed her.


  Then she forced herself to breathe. Failure wasn''t opening the wrong lock. Failure
  was never trying. She''d spent her whole life terrified of not being enough—not
  smart enough, not skilled enough, not worthy enough. That fear had been her true
  cage.


  She began to work, feeling rather than forcing. The mechanism clicked. The door
  groaned open.


  Beyond lay a flooded chamber, the Ordeal''s true test. Ancient shelves rose from
  black water, and somewhere in that darkness was the path forward. Tomás hung back,
  afraid.


  Zara stepped into the water. It was freezing, rising to her chest, then her neck.
  She had to dive under, find the submerged passage. Every instinct screamed at her
  to surface, to breathe, to survive.


  But she pushed deeper into the darkness, into the drowning silence where her lungs
  burned and her vision spotted. The old Zara—the frightened girl who stole because
  she didn''t believe she deserved better—died in that water.


  When she surfaced in the air pocket beyond, gasping, she was different. Harder.
  Clearer. She''d passed through her own death and emerged.


  She hauled herself onto dry stone, coughing. The Sunken Library''s entrance loomed
  before her, finally within reach.


  Then she heard it: splashing behind her. Not Tomás.


  The Scorpion Guild had found another way through.'
