output: 'Yuki''s scanner pinged off the walls of Crew Quarters B, finding nothing
  but dust motes dancing in the red emergency lighting. The bunks were made with military
  precision, personal effects frozen in place—a child''s drawing on one locker, a
  coffee cup still half-full on a nightstand. No struggle. No evacuation. Just...
  interruption.


  Her tablet synced with a nearby terminal. The last log entry from Commander Reyes
  was timestamped 72 hours ago: "Phase resonance stable. The interface holds. We''re
  initiating human trials tomorrow. God help us." Human trials? Yuki pulled up the
  research manifest. Nothing authorized. Just atmospheric studies and quantum relay
  maintenance.


  The medical bay door hissed open. Inside, the stench of ozone and something else—metallic,
  sweet. Cryo-chambers lined the walls, their readouts flickering. One was active,
  but empty. The scanner spiked. "Quantum decay detected," it reported. "Waveform
  collapse imminent." That made no sense. Waveforms didn''t collapse in biological
  systems.


  A shadow moved at the edge of her vision. She spun. For a heartbeat, she saw a figure
  in the corridor—then it fractured, like light through broken glass, and vanished.
  Her breath caught. "Hello?" Nothing. Just the groan of the hull.


  The station shuddered. Gravity fluctuated, sending her crashing against a bulkhead.
  Warning lights flared: "Containment breach, Lab Seven." The blast doors began sealing.
  Yuki lunged for the manual override, her fingers flying across the panel. The physics
  was wrong—standard pressure differentials shouldn''t trigger this. She recalibrated
  the sensor net, forcing the system to recognize false positive. The doors halted,
  groaning.


  Through the narrowing gap, she saw it again: a shimmer, a silhouette of a woman
  in a commander''s uniform, flickering like a corrupted video file. It pointed down
  the corridor. Then it dissolved.


  Her scanner confirmed what her eyes refused: non-baryonic matter traces. Human-shaped.


  She knew where she had to go.'
