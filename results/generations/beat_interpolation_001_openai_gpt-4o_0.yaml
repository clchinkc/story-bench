output: 'The morning sun crept through the dusty windows of Marcus''s curiosity shop,
  casting long shadows over shelves crammed with peculiar objects. Elena lingered
  near the entrance, her fingers brushing against a display of intricately carved
  wooden figures. Marcus, a silver-haired former adventurer with eyes that seemed
  to see beyond the present, watched her from behind the counter.


  "You’re early," he said, a knowing smile playing on his lips.


  Elena shifted, clutching her wool coat tighter. "I’m not sure why I’m here," she
  admitted, the memory of the glowing map still vivid. "I just—"


  "—thought about it all night?" Marcus interjected, walking around the counter. "I
  suspected as much. The map chose you, Elena, because it sees what you dismiss."


  She frowned, skepticism tugging at her. "And what’s that? A penchant for organizing
  dusty tomes?"


  "Precisely," Marcus said, his voice rich with encouragement. "You have an eye for
  detail, a mind that finds patterns others overlook. That’s more valuable than you
  think."


  Elena’s gaze dropped to a leather satchel resting on a nearby table. Marcus picked
  it up, offering it to her. "Inside, you’ll find a compass and some essentials. The
  compass isn’t like any you’ve seen; it points to where you need to be, not where
  you think you should go."


  Taking the satchel, Elena felt its weight, both literal and metaphorical. "I don’t
  know if I can do this," she murmured.


  Marcus chuckled softly. "Doubt is a companion on all great journeys. But remember,
  the map didn’t make a mistake. It’s not about fighting or spells. It’s about seeing
  what others cannot."


  She nodded, a flicker of resolve igniting within her uncertainty. "Thank you, Marcus."


  "Trust yourself, Elena," he replied. "The forest will test you, but it’s your librarian
  heart that will guide you through."


  As she turned to leave, the morning light seemed a little less daunting, and the
  path ahead a fraction clearer.'
