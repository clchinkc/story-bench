output: 'Processing was a three-hour maze of biometric scans and political interrogation
  disguised as immigration forms. The Collective wasn''t a unified utopia—it was a
  fractured network of stations, each with its own laws and allegiances. Jin''s hands
  trembled as he signed away his terrestrial citizenship on a screen that flickered
  with advertisements for zero-gravity manufacturing and data brokerage services.


  "You look lost," said a woman with graying hair and calloused hands, appearing at
  his elbow. Dr. Kaelen, her badge read. Former IPCC, now head of Station 7''s environmental
  research division. "Come on. I''ll show you what ''free'' actually means here."


  She led him through corridors lined with hydroponic bays where refugees from a dozen
  Earth nations worked under humming lights. "The Collective doesn''t extradite,"
  she said, "but we commodify. Information is currency. Your leak is already being
  auctioned to the highest bidder—some factions want to weaponize it against Earth,
  others want to bury it deeper than the Council did."


  In her cramped office, she pulled up schematics Jin recognized—his own research,
  but annotated with data he''d never seen. "The carbon capture tech you leaked? It
  works. But the catalyst requires dysprosium in quantities that would demand aggressive
  asteroid mining. The Council suppressed it because of Earth politics. We might suppress
  it because of space economics. Different gods, same sacrifice."


  Jin''s stomach turned. He''d imagined the Collective as humanity''s conscience,
  not another marketplace.


  But then Kaelen introduced him to the Remnant Protocol—a small faction of scientists
  who believed in open-source salvation. They offered him a lab, protection, and a
  broadcast network to reach Earth directly. "We can finish your work," their leader
  said, a young engineer with radiation scars on her neck. "Make the tech viable without
  the mining. But we need your name, your credibility."


  It was everything he''d risked his life for. A platform. A purpose. Safety.


  Then came the condition.


  "Earth''s governments are calling you a terrorist," the engineer said. "We need
  you to publicly denounce the Global Sustainability Council—live, unfiltered. Name
  names. Turn your science into a political weapon for our independence movement."


  Jin thought of Yuna, still on Earth, probably under surveillance. If he named her
  as a co-conspirator, even in defense, he''d paint a target on her back. If he refused,
  the Remnant Protocol would withdraw their support, leaving him vulnerable to the
  data brokers who wanted to sell his research to corporate stations.


  Kaelen watched him silently. She''d made her own compromises, he realized. The scars
  on the engineer''s neck told stories of radiation exposure from unsafe mining operations
  the Collective allowed.


  "I''ll do it," Jin said, the words bitter. "But I won''t name Yuna. Or my family.
  You get me, my research, my condemnation of the Council. But I keep some names out
  of it."


  The engineer frowned. "That weakens the impact."


  "Then find another martyr."


  They agreed, but the price was immediate: six months of exclusive access to his
  research before public release. Six months where the Remnant Protocol could patent,
  modify, or potentially bury the technology if it threatened their own mining interests.
  Six months where Earth burned a little brighter while Jin worked in his new lab,
  safe among the stars.


  That night, he floated by a viewport, watching the marble of Earth turn below. He''d
  gained everything he''d fought for—safety, a platform, a chance to finish his work.
  But he''d sold the one thing that had driven him here: the certainty that truth
  belonged to everyone, immediately, without compromise.


  He''d become exactly what the Council had been—just with a different view.'
