output: 'The curiosity shop smelled of old leather and something Elena couldn''t quite
  name, like air that had aged for centuries. She''d found Marcus''s address tucked
  inside her grandmother''s map, written in handwriting that trembled with urgency.


  "You didn''t want to come," Marcus said without looking up from cataloging a shelf
  of glass vials. He was smaller than she expected, with silver threading through
  his dark hair and one hand that moved with mechanical precision—clearly not the
  hand he''d been born with.


  "The map," Elena started. "My grandmother''s ghost—it doesn''t make sense. I can''t—"


  "Can''t what?" His eyes found hers then, sharp and knowing. "Can''t leave? Can''t
  fail? Can''t be ordinary?"


  She opened her mouth and closed it.


  "I spent twenty years chasing adventure thinking I was special," Marcus continued,
  moving to a leather satchel hanging behind the counter. "Fought monsters, won glory.
  Then I lost this hand learning a hard truth: the forest doesn''t care about your
  skills. It tests your intentions. Your resolve. Your willingness to look closely
  at what others miss."


  He set the satchel before her, already packed with supplies she didn''t recognize,
  and a brass compass that seemed oddly warm.


  "You catalog books," he said. "You organize chaos into meaning. You read patterns.
  The Thornwood will demand exactly that—not swordplay. Understanding."


  Elena''s fingers traced the compass. "You could come with me."


  "No." His smile was sad. "The threshold is yours to cross alone. My journey is finished.
  But the forest will show you what librarians have always known—that knowledge and
  observation are their own kind of power."


  She fastened the satchel across her shoulder, still uncertain, still gripped by
  doubt. But something in his conviction loosened her resistance just enough.


  "I don''t know if I''ll survive this," she whispered.


  "You will," Marcus said. "The map chose well."'
