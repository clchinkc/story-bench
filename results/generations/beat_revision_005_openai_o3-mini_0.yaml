output: "The apartment was dark when Maya finally unlocked the door. She didn’t bother\
  \ with the lights; what was the point when the gallery had officially closed its\
  \ doors that morning—twenty years of her mother’s legacy reduced to “LEASE AVAILABLE”\
  \ signs? Alone in the silence, every failed effort mocked her: the crowdfunding\
  \ had fallen short, the investors had walked away, and even her brother’s calls\
  \ had stopped coming. \n\nShe sank onto the cold floor by the window, still wearing\
  \ her coat, her body small against the vast emptiness of the room. The city lights\
  \ blurred through the glass—or maybe through her tears—each glimmer a reminder that\
  \ life continued relentlessly outside, indifferent to her despair. Her mother’s\
  \ last painting hung on the wall opposite, barely visible in the darkness: a woman\
  \ walking toward an unseen horizon, as if stepping out of life and into eternity.\
  \ \n\nMaya remembered sitting in the hospice, holding her mother’s hand as the fragile\
  \ flame of life flickered away, promising to keep the gallery alive. “It’s not about\
  \ the art,” her mother had whispered, voice soft yet resolute, “it’s about having\
  \ a place where people can feel something real.” Now, that promise lay in ruins.\
  \ Maya had failed that promise. She had failed her mother. She had failed herself.\
  \ \n\nWith a subtle shudder, as if feeling the weight of mortality pressing down\
  \ on her, Maya pulled her knees to her chest. In the quiet isolation of the dim\
  \ apartment, despair mingled with a sense of finality—a silent reckoning with loss\
  \ so profound it spoke of endings. Outside, the city pressed on with cars, sirens,\
  \ and life, but here, time had ceased to matter. There were no calls to make, no\
  \ plans to execute—only the jagged shards of everything she’d lost. Tonight, with\
  \ a heavy heart and a hint of the inevitable, she let herself break."
