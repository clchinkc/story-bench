output: 'Monaco hums like a tuned engine, and Sorokin’s yacht rides that frequency
  with vulgar grace—teak decks, Swarovski railings, a DJ who believes volume is a
  personality. Miri moves through it in a silver slip and flats she can run in, carrying
  a flute of champagne she isn’t drinking. Saffron has reinvented herself three times
  between the gangway and the gallery lounge; currently she’s a bored heiress from
  São Paulo with a laugh like spilled coins, on Sorokin’s arm long enough for his
  guards to memorize her face and stop looking at anyone else. Jules is the “lighting
  director” at the DJ booth, and Nico, in an oil-stained polo, is simply another deckhand
  with an honest slouch and a coil of line at his feet.


  “Cameras are on loop,” Jules murmurs in their bones. “Also, someone paid too much
  for that LED wall.”


  “It’s Monaco,” Miri says, palming the lifted concierge badge Saffron handed off
  with a cheek-kiss. “Paying too much is an ethos.”


  The painting is two decks down in the art salon, behind glass that whispers its
  climate in soft blue digits. A saint reading in a window—Florentine school, 1510s—eyes
  lowered and calm, stolen off a wall in Amsterdam in 1941 by men who called theft
  “inventory.” Miri feels the swell and settle of the sea beneath her as she magnets
  a spoof over the humidity sensor. She knows how old varnish sighs when it’s safe.
  She knows when it isn’t.


  Nico ghosts in beside her to “wipe a spill,” and his rag covers the manual louver
  of the fire-suppression panel. “They went with FK-5-1-12 in here,” he mutters, his
  voice a smile. “Flash flood, nonconductive, won’t ruin the art, will ruin your night
  if you need to breathe. Manual pull’s behind that brass fan. If we have to vanish
  in a hurry…”


  “I prefer not dying,” Miri says.


  “Then use these.” He slips her a lipstick-sized tube. “Citrus rebreathers. You too,
  Jules.”


  “Because nothing says glamour like sticking a pacifier in your mouth,” Jules crackles
  back.


  The plan unfolds like a well-made hinge. Saffron’s stories draw a knot of VIPs to
  a champagne fountain; Jules loops the salon feed so the guard thinks the painting
  is still unmolested while Miri works the screws with gloved hands and a wrist that
  never shakes. The glass lifts. The world narrows to breath and varnish and the little
  sigh the wood panel gives as she eases the frame free. Saffron strolls by the doorway
  with a backwards glance that means Someone is coming and executes a stumble that
  sends an entire tray of oysters into a hedge fund manager’s lap, earning applause.


  Miri uses the distraction to slide the canvas into a travel tube she lined herself,
  acid-free paper and a vacuum seal. She palms a decoy plate into the empty frame;
  the camera loop says nothing happened. She tastes victory like salt.


  And then the minor god of Parties and Bad Timing dispatches an influencer in a gown
  the size of a sail who yanks open the blackout shade. Sun pours over the saint like
  interrogation. The light sensor blips red; climate spikes. Miri’s heart snaps to
  alert. Saffron appears, all gasp and conspiratorial apology, and drapes her shawl
  over Miri’s hands, over the canvas, turning to the woman with an affronted, “Darling,
  UV is the enemy of vintage. Also our cheekbones,” and flutters the shade shut to
  laughter. Jules feeds the system a six-second buffer of perfect readings; the blip
  disappears. The guard at the salon door glances up and then down again to his phone.


  Miri seals the tube and breathes. On the aft deck, Formula One engines scream past
  the harbor wall, and confetti drifts like artificial snow. “Package secured,” she
  says, softly, a promise to the Amsterdam family and to herself, and turns toward
  their exit route through the service stairs Nico has kept propped with a bucket
  and a rag.


  Halfway to the tender, the yacht’s sound shifts. It’s not engines or bass. It’s
  a voice she knows better than her own, a precise mezzo with Vienna edges, coming
  through Sorokin’s sweet little party’s PA like a blade under silk.


  “Good evening, guests. I regret to interrupt. I’m Alexandra Voss, the security consultant
  Mr. Sorokin retained for tonight’s festivities. We’ll be conducting a routine integrity
  audit. Please enjoy another drink. The audit will be invisible—unless you have something
  to hide.”


  Miri stops so suddenly Nico bumps her. The tube is a warm weight against her ribs.
  For a heartbeat, she’s thirty again, in a museum basement that smelled like old
  paper and betrayal while Alexandra counted rules and then broke them. Confidence
  fractures along fault lines she thought she’d filled.


  “Jules,” Miri breathes, “she’s here.”


  “I see her,” Jules says, and sends a grainy feed to their inner eyes: Alexandra
  on the upper deck in a black suit, no jewelry, hair pinned in a neat coil. She has
  a glass of water, not champagne. She also has a small team with handheld wands that
  glitter with UV light. “She’s scanning the exits.”


  “Of course she is,” Miri says. “She taught me to hide in the loudest part of the
  room.”


  The painting is safe—physically. The algorithm Jules wrote says the salon still
  holds it. False victory. But Alexandra’s wands are for microdot tracers and DNA
  lacquer—the varnish that glows under UV, that tells customs exactly where a thing
  has been. Miri hears, as if time looped, Alexandra’s voice from five years ago:
  The art must tell the truth of its provenance, even if someone died to keep it quiet.


  Jules swears. “She brought SpectraTrace. They’ll dust guests’ hands. The exit scanners
  will sing if you’ve handled the saint.”


  Saffron, somewhere near the fountain, laughs too brightly. “Add a powdering problem
  to my powder room. How quaint.”


  The nature of the heist tilts. It isn’t just theft now; it’s purification, mid-ocean.
  If they bring the painting out with the tracer active, the Amsterdam family gets
  a legal nightmare and the team gets a record they can’t wash. They need to neutralize
  the DNA lacquer and microdots tonight.


  Miri feels the party press in: bodies, perfume, the glare of yacht lights bouncing
  off the black water. Alexandra’s team fans out, smiling. Sorokin is performing convivial
  menace near the bow. Somewhere a bottle explodes with delight. “Change of plan,”
  Miri says, and Nico nods like he knew that was coming.


  “We go to the service galley,” Jules says. “Solvents, heat, brushes. You do your
  midnight conservation, queen.”


  “Conservator,” Miri corrects out of reflex; it steadies her. “And I need ethanol,
  distilled water, and cotton swabs.”


  “I can get you the world,” Saffron purrs into a guard’s distraction, and ten minutes
  stretch into five while Alexandra’s voice is courteous and relentless over the PA,
  shepherding guests through joy and compliance. Miri thinks of revenge with a heat
  she could bite, and sets it aside. Work first. Then the past.


  She lays the tube on stainless steel where chefs were slicing citrus an hour ago.
  The galley hums with dormant power. Jules kills the nearby cameras. Nico stands
  by the door like a wall she asked for and finally got. Miri opens the tube and breathes
  cold air that smells like old oil and dust. Under a spray of warm light from a gooseneck
  lamp, she works: tiny circles, the neat, slow bite of solvent lifting a varnish
  that fluoresces under Jules’s UV flashlight like a lie being erased.


  The delete bar of the night slams down. “Decks three and four are closing,” Alexandra’s
  voice says, and a hum answers it—bulkheads sealing, doors magnet-locking. Pressure
  builds like weather.


  “Incoming,” Nico says. “Two with wands, one with a nose for panic.”


  Outside, the gala laughs; inside, the crew folds. Saffron appears, flushed and furious,
  a smudge of UV powder glittering at her wrist. “She knows me,” she says; the accent
  drops like a dress. “She called me by my legal name and took my phone, and told
  me to wait while they ‘process’ me. I didn’t wait.”


  “She’ll come here herself,” Jules says. “She knows we’d run to the sinks.”


  On cue, footsteps that don’t hurry. Alexandra always taught the art of the unhurried
  chase. Miri wipes the last syrup of tracer from the saint’s shoulder, seals the
  tube, and glances at the door.


  “Two choices,” Saffron says, bright with gallows humor. “Throw the painting at her
  and hope it’s heavy, or go out the window and swim to Italy.”


  “Third option,” Nico says, already at the brass louver, fingers sliding. “We vanish.”


  Miri’s eyes cut to the panel—Chekhov’s brass fan. “Do it.”


  He yanks. The hiss is instant and thick, a cold cloud that blossoms through the
  galley, white as applause, tasting faintly of mints and machine rooms. Alexandra’s
  silhouette smears into fog as the world becomes unfocused.


  “Breathers,” Nico says, already popping his citrus tube between his teeth. Miri
  shoves one into Saffron’s hand and one into Jules’s. They look ridiculous and alive.


  Through the thinning white she sees Alexandra, one arm up to cover her mouth, the
  other steady and reaching for the lockpad. Their eyes meet—Miri’s old life at the
  other end of a doomed hallway. Revenge laces her spine. The painting is heavy against
  her. Jules coughs hard. Saffron’s hands tremble. Priorities line up like cars on
  a grid.


  “Go,” Miri says, and it’s to her crew, not toward Alexandra. Nico ghosts into the
  corridor, where alarms have decided it’s a good time to imitate sirens. The walls
  literally close; a bulkhead starts to slide, a hard silver horizon. Miri wedges
  Nico’s coil of line into the seam—another borrowed trick—and squeezes them through.


  Security converges, wands useless in milk-white air; a guard’s flashlight snags
  on the line and clatters. Saffron, breath hissing, laughs once. “We’re going to
  die smelling like oranges.”


  “Monaco could do worse,” Jules throws back, tight as wire.


  They spill into the service stairs, lungs burning behind the citrus, the painting
  safe and heavier for being right. Below them, the tender bay is a rectangle of black
  water and possibility. Above, Alexandra’s voice sharpens for the first time.


  “Miriam,” she says, through the fog and metal. “Drop it.”
