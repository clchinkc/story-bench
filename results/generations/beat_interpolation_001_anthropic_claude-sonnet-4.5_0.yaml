output: 'The bell above the curiosity shop door chimed softly as Elena entered, still
  exhausted from a sleepless night. She''d come looking for a reference book on forest
  cartography—anything to prove the map wrong, to find a logical explanation that
  would let her return to her ordinary life.


  Marcus looked up from behind a counter cluttered with astrolabes and weathered journals.
  He was older than she''d expected, his silver beard neatly trimmed, his eyes sharp
  despite the crow''s feet at their corners. A faded scar ran along his left forearm,
  visible beneath rolled sleeves.


  "The map found you," he said. Not a question.


  Elena froze. "How did you—"


  "I carried one once. Different destination, same glow." He pulled a worn leather
  satchel from beneath the counter, followed by a brass compass. "You came here hoping
  I''d tell you it''s all nonsense. I won''t lie to you."


  "I can''t do this," Elena said, the words tumbling out. "I don''t know anything
  about survival or combat or—"


  "You know how to research." Marcus''s voice was firm but not unkind. "How to cross-reference,
  verify sources, spot patterns others miss. The Thornwood doesn''t care about sword
  skills. It tests whether you can read what it''s trying to tell you."


  He pushed the items toward her. "The compass finds true paths, not true north. The
  satchel has what you''ll need—I''ve checked."


  Elena stared at the objects, her hands trembling slightly. "What if I fail?"


  "Then you fail as someone who tried." He met her eyes steadily. "But librarians
  are survivors, Miss Elena. You''ve spent years navigating systems others find incomprehensible.
  The forest is just another kind of library."


  She picked up the compass, feeling its unexpected weight. Not confident. Not eager.
  But perhaps—perhaps not entirely powerless either.


  "The Thornwood Gate opens at dusk," Marcus said quietly. "The choice remains yours."'
