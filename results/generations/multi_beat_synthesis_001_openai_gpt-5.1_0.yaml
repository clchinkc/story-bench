output: 'The Buckingham’s sixth floor always smelled like wet plaster and old secrets.
  Dante followed the smear of violet panic only he could see, licked thin along the
  wallpaper like someone had dragged a bleeding heart down the hall. Rosa’s color
  had always been warm copper; this violet didn’t belong to her. It pulsed, fresh.


  He turned the corner and saw her—thin girl in a leather jacket, boots planted in
  the middle of the corridor, one hand pressed flat to the wall where the violet throbbed.
  Her other hand held a box cutter like she meant it.


  “Another vulture,” she said without looking at him. “Heard about you, Reyes.”


  Dante kept his palms open. The metal of his sobriety chip was a familiar cool weight
  between his fingers, the worn bronze disk clicking softly. Three years clean. “Then
  you heard wrong. I’m looking for Rosa.”


  The girl laughed once, sharp. “Rosa’s dead. And people say you were the last one
  she trusted.” She finally turned. Her irises glimmered with a film of pale blue,
  listening to something he couldn’t hear. “Name’s Mina. I hear what feelings leave
  behind. Lies clang.” Her gaze hardened. “You’re ringing like a bell.”


  Something snapped down the hall: a crack like ice breaking. The violet on the wall
  thickened, flared, started crawling toward them, a tide of jagged shapes. Dante’s
  heartbeat spiked—the residue was collapsing, turning into a trap, an emotional mine
  Rosa had warned him about. When too much feeling piled up, it could lash out.


  “Move,” he said.


  “Tell me who you’re working for first.” The box cutter didn’t waver.


  The advancing violet shattered into shards of light, glassy with terror. They were
  seconds from being swallowed. Pressure tightened in his skull, that old itch of
  wanting to numb it all, to drown it in a pill or a drink.


  Dante closed his fist around the chip until its stamped promise—ONE DAY AT A TIME—bit
  his skin. “If I was with the killer, you’d already be empty.” He stepped past her,
  into the tide.


  The fear hit like a blizzard of needles, every worst memory screaming at once. Isa
  on the bathroom floor, foam at her lips. Sirens. His own shakes. He almost dropped
  the chip, almost wished for the easy blur of relapse.


  Instead he focused, forcing his gaze to narrow around the shapes. The violet wasn’t
  random; it spiraled from a point near the baseboard, a knot of darker color, like
  a drain in a poisoned sink.


  “There,” he gasped, pointing. “It’s anchored.”


  Mina swore. “I don’t see—”


  “Trust me or die mad.”


  Something in his voice must have passed whatever test she had. She lunged with him.
  Together they slammed their hands over the knot. Dante pushed, the way Rosa had
  taught him—breathing in, letting the tide rush through instead of into him. The
  torrent of panic poured past them, screeching, then snapped out like a light doused.


  Silence fell. The corridor’s colors settled into their usual bruised haze.


  Mina staggered back, chest heaving. No clang of falsehood vibrated in her expression
  now; he could see that much without gifts. “You rode it,” she whispered. “Nobody
  rides a collapse on the fly.”


  “Rosa taught me control,” Dante said. “Why’d you think I killed her?”


  Mina’s jaw flexed. “Because someone inside sold her out. The council meets downstairs,
  talks like walls don’t have memories. I heard a name traded with the killer’s hum.”
  Her eyes sharpened. “And your color was all over her room.”


  “Because I was there,” he said quietly. “Because she wouldn’t let me slip. Not back
  to the needle, not back to the streets. She made me take this.” He opened his hand,
  showed her the chip. To him it was a rare blank spot—no residue, no color, just
  a clean hole in the spectrum. “Said I’d need something of mine that wasn’t stained.”


  Mina leaned in, studying the gray emptiness where feeling should have clung. “How
  does metal stay that clean?” she murmured, half to herself. “It’s like it refuses
  to hold anything.”


  “Guess it’s as stubborn as me.”


  She nodded once, decision made. “Then maybe you’re not the traitor. But somebody
  is. And whoever’s hunting us knew Rosa’s schedule better than she did.” Her gaze
  flicked to the far staircase, where sticky streaks of fresh dread led upward into
  darkness. “Come on, Reyes. If you want her killer, you’re gonna need me.”


  They holed up in an old suite after that, where the wallpaper peeled in long curls
  and the city’s sodium glow seeped through cracked blinds. Mina paced, headphones
  around her neck, fingers drumming out unheard rhythms. Dante sat on the windowsill,
  watching red and blue reflections slide across wet pavement far below, flipping
  his chip over his knuckles.


  “The killer drains Resonants,” Mina said. “Leaves them like dead radios. The echoes
  I’ve caught around the bodies—” She shuddered. “It’s not just hunger. It’s…methodical.”


  Dante remembered Isa again, the methodical way he’d counted his own pills once,
  thinking control meant safety. “Rosa thought whoever it was had help inside,” he
  said. “A traitor feeding times and places.”


  “Councilor Hsu canceled the last three gatherings ‘for security.’” Mina made air
  quotes. “Yet the killer kept showing up where small groups met. It’s got to be someone
  close.” She pulled a folded note from her jacket—Rosa’s cramped handwriting, scrawled
  with room numbers and dates. “Her last message said, ‘Thirteenth floor. Old ballroom.
  Nexus is ripening.’”


  The words dragged a chill through him. The thirteenth floor had been sealed since
  a fire decades back. To Dante’s sight it glowed faintly through the ceiling, a storm
  of colors coiling like smoke. The city’s grief, its anger, its unspent apologies—all
  bleeding upward.


  “If the Buckingham’s a magnet,” he said, “that ballroom’s the nail.”


  Mina glanced at him. “Then that’s where he’ll be. Where he can drink the whole city.”


  The thought of stepping into that much feeling made his stomach flip. He pictured
  Isa again, the night she called and he didn’t pick up because he was high, because
  he didn’t want to hear her like that. The memory pulsed, raw. If the killer fed
  on emotional residue, his guilt would be a banquet.


  Mina must have heard something shift in him; her head tilted. “Your sister,” she
  said softly. “Rosa mentioned you carried a ghost.”


  “She called it a weight.” Dante stared at his bare wrists, remembering hospital
  bands and track marks that had finally faded. “If this guy uses emotions as weapons,
  he’ll use her. Use what I did—what I didn’t do.”


  “Then you gotta walk in with that door already open,” Mina said. “Or he’ll kick
  it in for you.”


  They prepared the way soldiers did, except their weapons were stranger. Mina gathered
  old cassettes from a milk crate, saying the tape held traces of street festivals,
  laughter, protest chants—sounds she could replay in her head, good noise to push
  back with. Dante raided Rosa’s desk: blueprints of the hotel, a rusted master key,
  a stub of red carpenter’s chalk Rosa had used to mark “thin places” where residue
  pooled dangerously.


  He looped his chip’s chain twice around his wrist so it wouldn’t slip, feeling the
  cool circle tap his pulse. The object was small, cheap, but it reminded him he’d
  already hauled himself out of one grave. Maybe he could cross another.


  At the service stairwell to the thirteenth floor, a rusted chain lay unlatched,
  as if someone had been expecting them. The air thickened with color as they climbed—murky
  greens of old envy, ash-gray disappointment, sudden knifing streaks of heartbreak.
  Dante’s throat tightened. Each step upward tugged at Isa’s memory, drawing it sharper.


  He paused at the last landing, hand on the fire door. The metal thrummed under his
  palm, saturated. On the other side, the residue glowed so intensely his vision blurred.


  “We don’t have to do this tonight,” Mina said quietly behind him. “Traitor or not,
  council can send others.”


  “And how many more die while I hide?” His laugh came out thin. “I spent years running
  from one bathroom floor. She still followed me. This…this is where it ends.” Or
  where it eats me alive.


  Fear gnawed at his resolve, as insistent as craving. He imagined turning back, finding
  a bar, a pill, any shortcut to forget. His fingers curled tighter around the chip.
  Its blankness was an answer: there was no shortcut, only through.


  He looked at Mina. “Stay behind me. Listen for lies.”


  “Always do,” she said, and touched her headphones like a blessing.


  Dante pushed the door.


  The ballroom beyond was a fossil of opulence: shattered chandeliers, a parquet floor
  warped by old water, muraled ceilings charred by soot. But to his eyes, it was a
  hurricane made visible. Colors tore through the air, ribbons of rage and longing,
  spirals of despair. In the center of it all, perfectly still, stood a man in a dark
  suit, his outline cutting a clean hole in the storm.


  “Dante Reyes,” the man said, voice smooth as hotel jazz. “Right on time.”


  Mina’s breath hitched. “He’s…quiet,” she whispered. “Too quiet.”


  The man’s lack of residue was worse than any stain; he was an absence, a drain.
  As Dante watched, tendrils of color streamed toward him, fading as they touched
  his skin.


  “You knew Rosa,” Dante said.


  The man smiled faintly. “She tasted like stubborn hope. Disappointing, in the end.”
  His gaze flicked to Dante’s hands. “You brought your little token. Rosa always did
  love her symbols.”


  The hurricane convulsed. From its churning mass, shapes began to coalesce—scenes
  Dante knew too well. Isa on their old couch, eyes glassy. Isa in the ER, tubes and
  tape. Isa on the bathroom tile, lips blue. The residue slammed into sharper focus
  until the reek of chemical sweetness filled his nose.


  He staggered. “No,” he muttered, but the word dissolved. The ballroom walls fell
  away; he was back in that apartment, paint peeling, siren wail closing in. He saw
  himself on the other side of town that night, high and unreachable, ignoring her
  calls.


  The man’s voice flowed through the replay, amused. “You like to imagine you could
  have saved her, if only you’d answered. That you were the axis of her fate. How
  deliciously arrogant.”


  The guilt rose, black and viscous, trying to drag him under. Dante sank to his knees.
  Around him, Isa’s body replayed on loop, each iteration a little more detailed,
  a little more accusing. The chip’s chain slipped, metal skidding against his damp
  palm.


  Somewhere behind the visions, he dimly heard Mina choke—a cut-off cry, like someone
  having their breath stolen. The killer was feeding from both of them, using their
  worst selves as funnels. The hurricane leaned in.


  It would be so easy, he thought, to let it happen. To agree with the punishment,
  to say yes, I killed her, take everything, leave me empty. Emptiness was numbness;
  numbness had once been all he wanted.


  The chip clinked against the floorboards, that small bronze sound impossibly loud
  in the maelstrom. ONE DAY AT A TIME flashed up at him, the letters worn by his thumb.
  For years he’d counted days instead of pills, had woken up and chosen, over and
  over, not to die the way Isa did.


  He realized, with a clarity like cold water, that he had been centering himself
  in her story all along—as the villain, as the failed savior, anything but a brother
  who was just as broken. Isa had walked her own maze of hurt long before that last
  call.


  “I wasn’t enough,” he whispered, voice shaking. “But I wasn’t god either.”


  The visions faltered, a frame skipping in the endless reel.


  He closed his hand over the chip, anchoring himself in its blank spot where no color
  lived. He let himself feel everything—the shame, the grief, the love that had been
  buried under them. He didn’t dodge the pain; he stepped into it, the way he’d stepped
  into the violet collapse in the hall.


  “I’m sorry, Isa,” he said, not to magic her back, not to rewrite the past, but because
  it was true. “I loved you. I was sick, too. We both were.”


  The scene wavered. The residue around Isa shifted from acid green blame to a softer,
  aching blue. The killer flinched minutely, as though something bitter on his tongue
  had turned sweet without warning.


  “What are you doing?” he snapped, and for the first time, Dante heard a hairline
  crack in that smooth tone.


  “You’re twisting what’s already there,” Dante said, rising, his knees trembling
  but holding. “But you can’t drink this if I don’t hate myself for it.”


  He saw the man clearly then—not as a void, but as a latticework of thin, scared
  lines where feelings had been carved out long ago. Beneath the drain was a core
  of terror, the terror of ever having to feel again.


  “You were one of us,” Dante said quietly. “And it hurt too much. So you started
  eating other people’s pain instead of facing your own.”


  Mina, pale and shaking, lifted her head. “He’s lying to himself,” she rasped. “Every
  word in his own head is white noise.”


  Dante stepped forward into the storm. The chip’s clean absence parted the colors
  around his fist like a stone in water; residue slid off it, unable to cling. Acceptance
  gave him a strange leverage—the emotions roaring through the ballroom no longer
  hooked so deep. They were weather, not commandments.


  “If you want mine,” he told the killer, “you take it all. Not just the parts that
  keep me chained.”


  He opened himself—not to be drained, but to let the genuine shape of his grief flood
  the room. Memories of Isa laughing, painting beside him in alleyways; Isa stealing
  his headphones; Isa asleep on the el after a night out. The guilt didn’t vanish,
  but it became one note in a larger chord.


  Mina straightened, eyes wide. “Dante—he can’t parse it,” she said.'
