output: 'Tomás dragged her down an alley of canvas awnings and sputtering braziers,
  then shouldered aside a stack of spice crates to reveal a dark seam in the stone.
  A breath of stale, cold air slid out.


  “They think the Approach is sealed,” he muttered. “They’re wrong.”


  They slipped into the crack just as a shout went up behind them. Zara heard boots
  pounding, the hiss of drawn steel, then the scrape of stone as Tomás heaved the
  crates back into place. Darkness swallowed them. Only after several heartbeats did
  her eyes catch the faint green smear of lichen along the tunnel walls.


  “Keep low,” he whispered. “And keep that map close. The Approach doesn’t like intruders.”


  “The Approach,” she echoed. “What does that even mean?”


  “The path the old librarians made to test themselves. To make sure only the desperate
  or the worthy reached the doors.”


  “Which are we?” she asked.


  His forced laugh scraped the dark. “We’re about to find out.”


  They moved in silence, save for their breathing and the soft scuff of their boots.
  The market’s noise faded until there was nothing but the slow drip of unseen water
  and the distant rumble of the desert shifting above. The tunnel widened into a low-vaulted
  corridor. Strange metal studs gleamed on the floor, spaced in a pattern that made
  her palms itch.


  “Stop,” Zara said.


  Tomás froze mid-step. “What?”


  She crouched, tracing the air above one stud, then another. Tiny ridges of dust
  marked a path where others had gone—and where some had not. In several spots, the
  dust was disturbed in sharp-edged circles, as if something heavy had slammed down
  from above.


  “Pressure plates,” she murmured. “And…there.” She pointed to hair-fine slits in
  the ceiling. “Blades, maybe. Or darts.”


  Tomás swallowed. “You can thread it?”


  “I can try.”


  The corridor ran straight for fifty paces. One misstep, and they’d be carved to
  pieces. Zara sucked in a slow breath, feeling the weight of the map against her
  chest, the image of her mother’s thin hands twisted in the bedclothes. Failure here
  wouldn’t just mean dying; it would mean all of this—every lie, every theft—had been
  for nothing.


  Her feet remembered nights on city rooftops, racing other children across broken
  tiles and sagging beams. She found a rhythm: three studs, skip two, a single toe
  on the edge of another. Tomás followed, awkward but careful, his breath harsh behind
  her.


  Halfway through, a shout echoed faintly down the passage behind them. The Scorpion
  Guild had found the crack.


  “Don’t look back,” she hissed.


  She reached the far side and spun. Tomás was two paces away when his boot heel grazed
  a stud she’d avoided. There was a soft click.


  “Move!” she snapped.


  His eyes flared. He lunged forward as the ceiling screamed to life. Blades scythed
  down in a glittering curtain. Tomás dove, but not far enough; one blade kissed his
  calf, opening a line of red. He crashed down, fingers scrabbling on smooth stone
  as the blades reset with a grinding whine.


  Behind him, a wedge of scorpion-marked cloaks spilled into view at the corridor’s
  mouth.


  Zara could run. She had the map, the path ahead, a wounded scholar who had already
  led her this far. The Guild wanted him more than her; they thought he’d betrayed
  them first. If she slipped into the dark now, she might lose them and still reach
  the Library.


  Her hand found the hilt of her knife. Her other hand, traitorously, reached toward
  Tomás.


  “I told you,” he wheezed, eyes already resigned. “Save the map. Save her.”


  The choice tasted like ash. She saw her mother’s face, not as it was now, but as
  it had been when Zara had first stolen a loaf of bread and been caught—disappointment,
  fear, a stubborn love that refused to let go.


  If she left Tomás, what did that make her? Just another Guild thief, weighing lives
  in coin.


  “Shut up,” she snapped, and dove back onto the trapped floor.


  She moved without thinking, body and breath in unison. She timed the next fall of
  the blades to the Guild’s advancing steps, grabbed Tomás by the collar, and rolled
  them both forward as steel howled down inches from her heels. A scream erupted behind
  them as at least one Guild enforcer misjudged the plates.


  They tumbled clear, chests heaving. Tomás stared at her as if seeing her for the
  first time.


  “You’re…not like the others,” he said.


  “Don’t make me regret it,” she shot back, hauling him to his feet. Blood slicked
  his calf, but he could limp.


  They pushed on. The corridor angled downward, air growing colder, heavier. At its
  end waited a circular chamber whose walls were carved with sunken eyes. In its center
  yawned a pit filled with dark, motionless sand.


  Tomás paled. “The Veil,” he whispered. “This is the Ordeal.”


  “Explain fast.”


  “Only those who cross are granted passage. The Librarians believed knowledge should
  cost you something. Sometimes…everything.”


  “Helpful,” she muttered, eyeing the sand. No bridge, no ledge, nothing. Just a thin
  stone lip and that suffocating dark.


  Tomás sank against the wall, wincing. “There’s more. I didn’t just study the Library.
  I opened it once. For a king who wanted its secrets for war. I thought knowledge
  should be free. But he burned cities with what he found. They exiled me, sealed
  the Library, and cursed any who tried to reach it.”


  Zara stared at him. “So this is your penance.”


  “And your mother’s last chance,” he said softly. “I heard about her sickness in
  the capital. It’s the same plague that started in the Library labs, years ago. My
  mistake helped make it. Helping you is the only way I can live with that.”


  The floor seemed to tilt. Her mother’s illness, the whispers of “origin unknown”—they’d
  all traced back here, to this man’s arrogance. Fury flared, hot and blinding.


  “You used me,” she said. “To clean up your mess.”


  “I offered a path,” Tomás replied. “You chose to walk it. But yes. I need this as
  much as you do.”


  The admission stripped him bare. No grand speech, no excuses. Just a bald, ugly
  truth. Zara’s anger tangled with something more corrosive: the fear that even if
  she crossed this Veil, even if she reached the Library, she still might fail. That
  her mother would die anyway, and all she’d prove was that the city was right: she
  was only good for stealing things that never truly mattered.


  She stepped to the edge of the pit. The sand was so dark it swallowed the torchlight.


  “What happens if I fall?” she asked.


  Tomás’s voice was a rasp. “You don’t fall. You sink. You’re buried. Until you give
  up, or until you let go of something you can’t imagine living without. The Ordeal
  decides.”


  “Do you ever shut up?” she muttered, because the alternative was letting the tremor
  in her hands show.


  She cinched her vest, feeling the crinkle of the map. Her life had been one long
  refusal to trust anyone but herself. That version of Zara had survived the alleys,
  the gangs, the Guild’s wrath. But that Zara would leave Tomás. That Zara would turn
  back if the cost looked too high.


  Maybe that Zara needed to die.


  She stepped off the edge.


  The sand closed over her like cold fire. There was no sensation of falling, only
  the slow, inexorable pull downward. She tried to swim, but her limbs moved like
  they were packed in wool. Grain filled her mouth, her nose, her ears. Panic exploded
  in her chest.


  This is stupid, you’re going to die here, your mother will die for nothing—


  Memories flickered in the suffocating dark: her first theft, the pride she’d felt
  bringing home food; the first time she’d lied to her mother about working in the
  market instead of running with a gang; Tomás’s face when she turned back for him.
  All of them threaded through with the same selfish core: I survive. Everyone else
  is optional.


  The sand squeezed tighter. Her lungs burned. She couldn’t tell if her eyes were
  open.


  What are you willing to lose?


  The question wasn’t a voice; it was a pressure, a demand written in every grain.
  She clutched at the map through her vest—the last, fragile tether to hope. The instinct
  to protect it, to protect herself, was a howl.


  Slowly, with a snarl of effort, she uncurled her fingers.


  “I’m not…doing this alone,” she thought, or maybe said; she couldn’t tell. “If I
  get through, it’s because of him. Because of everyone I owe. I’m done pretending
  I don’t care. Take whatever you want, but I won’t trade them for safety.”


  She let the idea of the old Zara—the one who ran, who cut ties before they could
  cut her—slip from her like a knife dropped in the dark. The fear of failing, of
  proving she’d never been more than a gutter rat pretending to be a hero, clung harder.
  She stared it down, chest aching.


  Maybe you do fail, the thought came. Maybe she dies. But you’ll know you didn’t
  run.


  Something cracked. The pressure surged, then vanished.


  Zara burst out of the sand with a choking gasp, collapsing onto solid stone. Air
  seared her lungs. She coughed, retched, wiped grit from her eyes. The chamber had
  changed: the pit was gone, replaced by a smooth dais. A narrow archway had opened
  in the far wall, breathing a faint draft of colder air.


  Tomás limped toward her from the entrance, eyes wide with something like awe.


  “You crossed,” he said.


  She pushed'
