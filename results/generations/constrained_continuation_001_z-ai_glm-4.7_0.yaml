output: 'The passage narrowed, the air growing stale and heavy with the scent of ozone.
  Tomás moved with frantic haste, his torchlight dancing over slick stone. Suddenly,
  a sharp *click* echoed beneath his boot. Zara grabbed his collar, yanking him backward
  just as a massive obsidian blade swung from the darkness, severing the air where
  his neck had been a moment before.


  "Ancient engineering," Zara hissed, dropping to her knees. She didn''t need magic;
  she needed eyes honed in the slums. She traced the counterweight mechanism with
  her fingers, finding the rusted release point. With a precise flick of her wrist,
  she jammed her dagger into the gear, disabling the trap. "Move. Before it resets."


  They sprinted until the tunnel vomited them out onto a jagged precipice overlooking
  a subterranean chasm. A narrow stone bridge spanned the gap, its edges crumbling
  into the void. The shouts of the Scorpion Guild echoed behind them, closer now,
  their torches flickering like angry eyes in the distance. Tomás scrambled onto the
  bridge, but his foot slipped on loose shale. He dangled over the abyss, clutching
  his satchel, his face pale with terror.


  Zara stood on solid ground. The Guild was seconds away; she could dash across the
  bridge and seal the heavy door behind her, escaping to find the Library alone. Safety
  was a jump away. But she looked at Tomás’s trembling hand and remembered her mother,
  bedridden and helpless. She reached out, gripping his wrist with iron strength.
  "Grab hold!"


  She hauled him up, muscles screaming, and they collapsed onto the safe side of the
  bridge as the door ground shut, cutting off their pursuers.


  "Why?" Tomás gasped, clutching his chest. "I didn''t deserve that. I translated
  the map for the Guild, Zara. I told them how to find the Library to save my own
  skin. I''m leading you into a trap."


  Zara stared at him, the betrayal stinging, but then she looked at the massive archway
  before them—the entrance to the Sunken Library. Her fear wasn''t of the dark or
  the Scorpions; it was the crushing weight of being her mother''s only hope. If she
  failed here, it wasn''t just her death; it was the erasure of her mother''s future.


  "Then you help me fix it," she said, stepping toward the archway.


  The moment she crossed the threshold, the floor dissolved. Zara plummeted into freezing,
  pitch-black water. The shock stole the air from her lungs, the cold seeping into
  her marrow. She thrashed, panic seizing her chest. She was a thief from the slums,
  a survivor, but here, in the face of this ancient test, she felt small. The image
  of her mother, wasting away in the capital, flashed before her eyes. If she drowned
  now, she failed the only person who ever loved her. She was a failure. She let go,
  sinking into the heavy silence. The Zara who stole to survive, who acted out of
  desperation, died in that dark water.


  Then, a spark of defiance ignited in her chest. Not like this. She kicked violently,
  breaking the surface with a ragged gasp. She clawed at the stone edge, hauling herself
  up, shivering but alive. The fear was gone, replaced by cold resolve. She stood,
  water dripping from her clothes, a new woman carved from the depths. But as she
  looked back, she saw the current had swept Tomás away, and the ink on the map in
  his vest had dissolved into unreadable pulp. The path was gone. They were inside
  the sanctum, but blind, with the Scorpion Guild undoubtedly boring through the sealed
  door behind them.'
