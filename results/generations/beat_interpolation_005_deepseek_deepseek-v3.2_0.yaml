output: 'The kitchen became her sanctuary. For three weeks, Maya cooked with disciplined
  precision, leaving meals in the warming oven as Lucia had instructed. She saw Alejandro
  only in glimpses—a retreating back, a shadow in the garden. The silence was a living
  thing.


  Then, one storm-lashed night, she found him in the kitchen at midnight, staring
  blankly into the open refrigerator. The rigid public figure was gone. In a faded
  Atlético Madrid shirt, he looked hollowed out, a man haunted by more than retirement.


  “Couldn’t sleep?” she asked softly.


  He started, then shrugged. “The quiet is loud tonight.”


  Maya didn’t ask permission. She lit the stove, pulled out eggs, and began to chop
  a leftover potato. “Tortilla española,” she said. “My abuela’s cure for every bad
  night.”


  He watched, silent, as she worked. The only sounds were the sizzle of oil and the
  drumming rain. When she slid the golden disc onto a plate, he didn’t retreat to
  his study. He sat at the kitchen island.


  “They called me ‘El Muro’,” he said abruptly, staring at the food. “The Wall. Unbreakable.”
  He took a bite, closed his eyes. “My father died the night before my first Champions
  League final. I played. We won. The press called it legendary focus.” He met her
  gaze, his own stark with a truth she knew he never shared. “It wasn’t focus. It
  was a wall. I built it that night, and I’ve lived inside it ever since.”


  The confession hung in the air, fragile as the steam rising from the tortilla. Maya’s
  original purpose—the salary, the restaurant—suddenly felt distant. Here was the
  real man, not the legend or the recluse, showing a crack in his foundation.


  She made a choice. Not as his employee, but as someone who recognized profound loneliness.


  “Walls keep things out,” she said, her voice steady. “But they also keep you in.”
  She didn’t move to touch him, but she leaned forward, holding the space between
  them. “The contract says I cook for you. It doesn’t say I have to let you eat alone.”


  A long silence stretched, filled only by the storm. Then, almost imperceptibly,
  the tension in his shoulders eased. He pushed the plate toward the center of the
  island, an unspoken invitation.


  Maya fetched a second fork. They shared the simple meal in the pool of kitchen light,
  not speaking, the professional barrier dissolving with every quiet bite. She was
  no longer just the chef saving her family’s legacy. She was a witness. And she was
  staying.'
