output: 'The crew quarters told a story of interrupted lives. Coffee cups sat half-empty
  on tables. A chess game frozen mid-move. Yuki catalogued everything with her scanner,
  fighting the urge to call out again into the suffocating silence.


  In Dr. Chen''s quarters, she found the first real clue—a tablet left open to research
  notes. Quantum cellular restructuring. Phase-shift experiments. The words blurred
  together, but one phrase stopped her cold: "Subjects report seeing through dimensional
  barriers."


  Subjects. The crew had been experimenting on themselves.


  She moved toward the medical bay, her scanner pinging with anomalous readings she
  couldn''t interpret. The air felt wrong here—thicker somehow, charged with static
  that made her hair stand on end. Emergency lighting flickered overhead.


  That''s when she saw the shimmer.


  It moved between the examination tables, a distortion like heat rising from summer
  asphalt. Humanoid. Watching her. Yuki''s breath caught as it drifted closer, and
  she stumbled backward, her shoulder slamming into a supply cabinet.


  "Stay back," she whispered, though her scientific mind was already cataloguing:
  no thermal signature, no mass reading, but undeniably present.


  The shimmer reached for her—and then withdrew, flowing through the wall like smoke
  through a screen.


  Yuki stood frozen for a full minute before forcing herself to move. More shimmers
  appeared in her peripheral vision as she searched the research wing, always retreating
  when she turned to face them directly. Afraid of her? Guarding her?


  In Lab Four, she found Commander Reyes''s emergency log, audio only, voice cracking
  with exhaustion and wonder: "The cure works. God help us, it works. But the process—we
  didn''t account for—" Static swallowed the rest. Then, barely audible: "Lab Seven.
  The data core. Someone has to know."


  A pressure seal blocked access to Lab Seven, its manual override locked. Yuki''s
  hands shook as she rerouted power from her scanner, bypassing the safety protocols.
  The door hissed open.


  The shimmers gathered behind her, silent witnesses, as she stepped through.'
