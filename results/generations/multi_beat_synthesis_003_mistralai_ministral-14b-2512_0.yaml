  The party aboard the *Tsarina* was a symphony of wealth and noise, the kind of place
  where champagne bubbles and stolen laughter mingled in the air. Miri moved through
  the crowd like a ghost, gloved fingers tracing the rim of her martini glass—*never*
  sip from the stem, a habit drilled into her by years of conserving priceless wine
  stains on priceless canvases. Her tailored black dress clung like a second skin,
  the neckline just daring enough to whisper *I’m here for a reason* to anyone who
  bothered to listen. Which no one did. They were all too busy admiring Viktor Sorokin’s
  collection, which was really just a list of things he’d taken from people who couldn’t
  fight back.


  She’d studied the *Madonna of the Peasants* for weeks: its dimensions, its frame,
  the exact pattern of Sorokin’s security rotations. The painting hung above the bar,
  where the oligarch could keep it in his sights while downing whiskey like it was
  water. Miri’s crew was scattered through the space—Oscar, her tech genius, had already
  disabled two of the yacht’s cameras with a well-placed EMP burst from his pocket
  device. Luca, the muscle with a degree in marine biology, stood by the railing,
  pretending to be mesmerized by the harbor while feeding a fish with a gold-plated
  lure. Meanwhile, Lina, the distraction specialist, was deep in conversation with
  a Russian heiress, her voice laced with just the right amount of faux outrage about
  Sorokin’s "taste in modern pieces." Miri herself had spent the last half-hour "studying"
  a less-than-stellar impressionist sketch in Sorokin’s collection, all the while
  memorizing the exact location of the painting’s secondary security alarm—buried
  in the wiring of the nearby speaker system.


  The plan was elegant, the kind that would’ve earned her a standing ovation at the
  Louvre. But then, standing ovations had gotten her blacklisted. Now, they’d get
  her a stolen Renaissance masterpiece and a fresh start.


  "Two minutes," Miri murmured into her earpiece, her gaze flicking up to the *Madonna*.
  The crowd shifted as two more bouncers approached the bar, their hands darting toward
  the painting’s frame. Miri’s pulse didn’t even hiccup. She’d accounted for this—another
  of Sorokin’s paranoid tweaks. The secondary laser grid was set to activate if anyone
  touched the frame *and* the painting moved more than five millimeters. Clever. But
  not clever enough.


  She took a slow sip, draining the glass. "Lina, darling," she said, stepping into
  the heiress’s orbit with practiced ease. "I was just telling Vera about your theory
  that Sorokin’s collection is... *questionable*." Lina’s eyebrows shot up, already
  baited. "Oh, *Miriam*, you don’t even want to know." The heiress tossed her head,
  diamonds catching the light like a warning beacon. "He once bought a Picasso at
  auction. Can you *believe*? From a private sale, no less. No provenance, just *bought*."


  Miri’s mouth twisted. "How very *Sorokin*." She leaned in, lowering her voice. "Between
  us? I’ve seen the ledger. That Picasso was a fake. But did he care? No. He just
  wanted to say he owned something *they* couldn’t touch." Vera’s laughter was sharp,
  cutting through the party’s hum like a knife. Miri let it wash over her, then stepped
  back just as the heiress’s phone buzzed with another call. "And now, Vera," she
  purred, "you’ll have to excuse me. I simply *must* show this poor woman the real
  Picasso before Sorokin has it melted down for scrap." The heiress’s jaw dropped,
  and Miri was gone, weaving toward the *Madonna* as the distraction held.


  Oscar’s voice crackled in her ear. "Grid’s down. Just *down*. Not the frame, not
  the alarm—*down*." Miri exhaled, the tension in her shoulders uncoiling. Luca had
  already slipped his fish lure onto the painting’s frame, its tiny hook nestled just
  right. All that was left was for Miri to pull the trigger—literally. She reached
  into her clutch, fingers brushing the concealed Taser hidden in its velvet lining,
  its prongs already loaded with the precise frequency to disable Sorokin’s high-end
  security without leaving so much as a flicker in the electrics. A whisper of a touch
  to the heiress’s arm, a murmur of "I’ll be right back," and she was there.


  The *Madonna* shimmered under the bar lights, its edges sharp with the weight of
  decades. Miri’s gloved hand hovered over the frame, counting silently. One. Two.
  The heiress was still lost in her phone, Lina’s work done. Three. The bouncers near
  the bar, their attention split between the crowd and the painting. Four. Luca had
  the hook in his teeth, his eyes locked on hers. Five—she yanked.


  The frame swung outward, the painting freeing itself like a bird from its cage.
  Miri had the canvas tight in her arms before the alarm even had time to register
  her movement. The Taser fired, not with a crackle but a soft *hiss*, like a snake
  unfurling its tongue. The bouncers near the bar stuttered to a stop, their hands
  flying to their temples. The crowd gasped, but no one saw the hook unclasp from
  the frame, or the tiny vial of liquid Luca had injected into the security system’s
  intake valve while "feeding" the fish. By the time Sorokin’s men realized the painting
  was gone, it would already be in the water, wrapped in a waterproof tarp, sinking
  toward the *Sea Sprite*—Oscar’s getaway boat, disguised as a harmless delivery vessel.


  Miri smirked, tucking the painting under her arm. "And *that’s* why we don’t trust
  provenance," she murmured, already melting into the crowd as the heiress finally
  noticed her absence. "Oh, *Miriam*—you absolute *wizard*."


  But then the drinks at the bar started glowing. A faint golden pulse, then a deeper
  red, like veins lit from within. The crowd’s murmurs turned to screams as the lights
  flickered, and the painting—her painting—*vanished*. Not from the wall, but from
  *themselves*. People clutched their heads, their vision swimming with the afterimage
  of the *Madonna*, its edges bleeding into the shadows.


  Oscar’s voice was thin, almost panicked. "Miri, the alarm *is* the painting. Not
  the frame. *The painting itself is the damn alarm*."


  She froze. The *Madonna* wasn’t just a painting. It was a *tracking device*, embedded
  in its surface, sending a pulse to Sorokin’s men the second it was disturbed. Which
  it had been. *Which it had been.* Her stomach twisted. Sorokin’s security would
  have eyes on the *Madonna* now, and by proxy, on her. But before she could process
  the betrayal, Luca’s voice cut through the chaos.


  "Boat’s compromised," he said, his usual calm replaced with something tighter. "Sorokin’s
  got a net. *Underwater net.*"


  Miri’s breath came faster. The *Sea Sprite* wouldn’t make it to the surface cleanly.
  And with the painting’s alarm triggered, Sorokin’s private security—*former* colleagues,
  *former* mentors—would be swarming the yacht in seconds. She adjusted her grip on
  the painting, now useless as a decoy but still the prize.


  "New plan," she said, her voice steady despite the adrenaline. "We move the target."
  And then, as the first of Sorokin’s men pushed through the crowd toward her, she
  spotted her.


  Dr. Elisabeth Voss stood near the exit, her sharp eyes scanning the room. She’d
  taught Miri how to read a crowd, how to spot the tell between confidence and fear.
  How to *frame* a woman. How to burn her life down with a single accusation. And
  now, here she was, Sorokin’s security consultant, the architect of this trap.


  Miri’s fingers tightened around the painting. The *Madonna* was for the Amsterdam
  family, but Voss was for *her*. And in the space of a heartbeat, she made her choice.


  "Luca," she said, meeting his gaze. "You’re with me." His eyes widened, but he nodded
  once, already shifting into muscle mode. The others would have to find their own
  way out. Let them. The *Madonna* was still warm from its frame, its edges damp from
  the yacht’s humid night air. Miri tucked it under her arm like a lover’s secret,
  then turned toward Voss, her mentor, the woman who’d stolen everything from her
  years ago.


  "Time to settle some debts, *Elisabeth*," she said, stepping forward as the music
  swelled, drowning out the screams. The painting was secondary now. Revenge was primary.
  And Voss wouldn’t see it coming.


  Luca had the secondary blade Oscar always packed—just in case. Miri’s smirk was
  razor-sharp. The Grand Prix’s chaos would be their shield. Sorokin’s men would have
  to cut through the crowd, through the neon and the noise, to find them. But Voss?
  She’d always been the one who saw the shadows.


  The yacht’s alarms blared, red lights strobing like a heart attack. Sorokin’s voice
  boomed over the speakers, his accent thick with fury. "*Perekhvat’!* Catch her!"
  But it was too late. Miri was already moving, Luca at her back, the painting forgotten
  in the rush. Voss’s eyes locked onto hers, and for a moment, they were students
  again, the Louvre stretching out behind them like a promise.


  "Miriam," Voss said, her voice cutting through the panic. "I knew you’d come." She
  reached for the gun at her hip, but Miri was faster. The Taser fired, not at Voss,
  but at the security system’s core—right where Luca had planted Oscar’s little *gift*.
  The screens flickered, then died. Sorokin’s men were left in the dark.


  "Lights out," Miri said, her breath warm against Voss’s ear as she pulled the trigger
  again, this time *into* her. The consultant stumbled, her vision swimming—not with
  the painting’s pulse, but with the same frequency Miri had used on the bouncers.
  Oscar’s tech, Luca’s precision, and Miri’s timing. Voss was blind in the chaos,
  her gun useless.


  Miri didn’t wait to see if her mentor would recover. "We’re out of here," she snarled,
  shoving past the confused guards. The crew was already in motion, the *Sea Sprite*
  still trapped beneath the net, but another getaway boat—one Luca had "borrowed"
  from a drunken tech mogul earlier—waited just off the starboard side. The painting
  would have to stay. For now, it was a liability.


  Luca was at her back, his blade flashing as he cut through a net of his own—a physical
  one, thrown by a guard who’d finally pieced together the puzzle. "You *idiot*,"
  Miri hissed, ducked as another slice of net grazed her hair. "That’s *twice* you’ve
  almost got me killed." But he didn’t answer, his focus locked on the yacht’s stairs,
  where Voss had reappeared, this time with a firearm in hand.


  Miri’s options were narrowing. The painting was still aboard, the alarm still broadcasting,
  and Sorokin’s real security—armed, cold, and *professional*—would be descending
  soon. But she couldn’t leave Luca behind. Not when he’d already bled for her once
  tonight. Not when his eyes met hers, silent and desperate, and she saw the flicker
  of the man she’d thought she’d left behind in the museum’s corridors.


  "Jump," she ordered. Luca didn’t hesitate. He was over the railing before she finished
  the word, his body arcing into the dark water. Miri followed, her dress snagging
  on the edge of the net as she leapt. The painting was gone. Voss was *not*.


  Elisabeth’s voice cut through the night, amplified by the yacht’s remaining speakers.
  "*Miriam!* You don’t have to do this." Her former mentor stood at the railing, the
  gun steady in her hands. The crew’s escape boat was just out of reach, the engines
  roaring as it tried to pull away from the dock.


  Miri didn’t answer. She didn’t have to. In the water, Luca’s arms found her, steady
  as the tide. Above them, Voss had the upper hand. But Miri had the chaos of the
  Grand Prix, the honking cars, the flashing lights, the crowd of rich, drunk, and
  distracted bodies on the deck. And she had a *plan*. Because when you’ve been framed
  for theft, hunted by your own industry, and rebuilt your life on the edge of a blade?
  You learn to think on your feet.


  She surfaced, gasping, her hair plastered to her face. "Lights *out*," she muttered,
  then turned toward the yacht, where Voss had taken aim. The gun fired, but not at
  her. The bullet struck the yacht’s power grid instead, a shot Miri had *known* she’d
  take. The explosion was small, but the *Tsarina* rocked, its emergency lights flickering
  to life as the main ones died.


  "Now," Miri said. Luca didn’t need to be told twice. He dragged her toward the escape
  boat, their fingers slipping on the slick hull. Behind them, the yacht’s alarms
  wailed, its security scrambling in the dark. Voss’s voice was closer now, her shouts
  drowned by the honking cars.


  "*Miriam!* If you don’t stop, I’ll—"


  But Miri didn’t listen. She was in the boat, Luca pulling the engine’s kill switch
  with his trembling hands. The vessel lurched forward, the net tearing like paper
  as they slipped into the harbor’s shadows. The Grand Prix’s headlights cut through
  the dark, cars streaking past like comets.


  Miri’s chest heaved, her breath coming in ragged bursts. The painting was lost.
  Voss had it. But Luca was alive. And that was enough. For tonight.


  He turned to her, his face pale in the glow of the city. "You *always* pick the
  painting," he said, his voice raw. "Even when it’s *her*." Miri didn’t answer. She
  didn’t have to. The harbor was too loud with the roar of the race, the splashes
  of the water. But Luca? Luca saw the truth in her eyes.


  And it was enough. For now.'
