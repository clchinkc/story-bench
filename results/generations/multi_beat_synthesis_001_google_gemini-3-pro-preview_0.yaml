output: 'The lobby of the Buckingham Hotel smelled of mildew and old sorrow, a scent
  that usually triggered the phantom itch of a needle in Dante’s arm. Today, however,
  the craving was drowned out by the jagged red spikes of aggression radiating from
  the stairwell. Silas, a massive man whose ability allowed him to hear the echoes
  of past violence, blocked the path. He crossed his arms, the sound of grinding stone
  vibrating in the air around him.


  "Turn around, junkie," Silas rumbled, his voice like gravel. "Rosa’s gone. We don''t
  need a liability who’s going to crack the first time the shadows get loud."


  "I''ve been clean three years, Silas," Dante said, keeping his voice steady despite
  the jagged neon-orange anxiety flaring at the edges of his vision. "And I see things
  you can only hear. Look at the third step."


  Silas hesitated, then tilted his head. To the naked eye, the marble was pristine.
  To Dante, it was coated in a pulsating, sickly violet residue—a psychic tripwire.
  "It’s a screamer rune," Dante explained, stepping closer. "If you’d stepped there,
  it would have broadcast our location to the killer and paralyzed your nervous system
  with panic."


  Dante knelt, pulling a battered spray paint can from his jacket pocket. It was a
  relic from Rosa, modified not to spray pigment, but to disperse a concentrated mist
  of neutralizing emotional static. He’d kept it as a memento, a heavy, rattling reminder
  of the woman who saved him from the streets. He shook it—*clack-clack*—and sprayed
  a clear burst over the violet trap. The angry color hissed and dissolved into grey
  smoke.


  Silas watched the trap fade, his posture softening just a fraction. "Useful," he
  conceded, though his eyes remained hard. "But Kael said the perimeter was clear.
  He checked this stairwell an hour ago."


  "Then Kael is lying," Dante said, the realization hitting him with the cold blue
  weight of betrayal. "He let the killer in. He’s feeding us to him."


  Silas cursed, the sound cracking like a whip. "Kael’s in the sub-basement. If he’s
  turned, he’s guarding the nest. You want to prove you’re not broken, Reyes? Help
  me kill the thing that took Rosa."


  Dante gripped the spray can tighter, his knuckles white. The urge to run, to find
  a dark corner and numb the grief, was a physical weight, but he nodded. He had to
  be better than his past.


  They moved toward the service elevator, the air growing colder and heavier with
  every step. The approach to the hotel''s bowels felt less like walking through a
  building and more like descending into a throat. Dante pressed the call button,
  and the machinery groaned, the sound echoing the dread pooling in his stomach.


  "We need a plan," Silas whispered, checking the heavy iron wrench he carried. "The
  killer—they call him the Hollow Man. He doesn''t just drain power; he eats regret.
  He finds the one thing you can''t forgive yourself for and pulls on the thread until
  you unravel."


  Dante stared at the rusted elevator doors. His regret wasn''t a thread; it was a
  tapestry. He thought of Mia, his little sister, and the night he had been too high
  to answer her call. The silence of the phone that morning was a sound that never
  left him. "I’m a buffet for him, then," Dante murmured.


  "That’s why you’re dangerous," Silas said, stepping into the open elevator car.
  "If you hesitate, if you let the guilt blind you, we both die. You have to lock
  that down."


  Dante looked at the spray can in his hand. Rosa had called it her "Gold Standard"—filled
  with the residual energy of a perfect summer sunrise she’d harvested from the rooftop
  years ago. It was supposed to be a tool for meditation, a way to remember the light
  when the darkness got too thick. Now, it felt like a grenade.


  "I can''t lock it down," Dante admitted, his voice trembling as the elevator descended
  into the suffocating dark. "It’s part of me. But I can aim it."


  The elevator shuddered to a halt. The doors opened onto the boiler room, but the
  machinery was silent. The space was dominated by a swirling vortex of vantablack
  darkness in the center of the room—a vacuum of emotional energy that hurt to look
  at. Standing before it was Kael, his eyes burnt out, a puppet dangling on invisible
  strings.


  "He’s here," Silas roared, charging forward to engage the traitor, but the vortex
  pulsed.


  A wave of psychic force slammed into Dante, dropping him to his knees. It wasn''t
  a physical blow; it was a memory. Suddenly, he wasn''t in the boiler room. He was
  in the squalid apartment three years ago. The sirens were wailing outside. Mia was
  on the floor, blue and still. The guilt rose like black bile, filling his lungs,
  choking him. *It’s your fault,* the Hollow Man’s voice whispered inside his skull,
  emanating from the void. *You chose the high over her. You deserve to drown in this.*


  Dante curled inward, the darkness stripping away his senses. He saw his sobriety
  shattering, the three years of fighting rendered meaningless by this singular, crushing
  failure. He was going to die here, just another junkie lost to the city.


  *No.*


  The thought was small, but sharp. He felt the cold metal of the spray can against
  his palm. He remembered Rosa’s voice. *You can’t paint over the cracks, Dante. You
  have to make them part of the art.*


  He wasn''t fighting the guilt anymore. He was accepting it. The pain of losing Mia
  was the proof that he had loved her. It wasn''t a weakness to be exploited; it was
  the truest thing he possessed.


  Dante forced his eyes open. The boiler room returned, warped by the killer''s influence.
  Silas was on the ground, bleeding from his ears. The Hollow Man, a shadow separating
  itself from Kael’s collapsing form, loomed over Dante, ready to feed on the final
  surrender.


  Dante screamed, not in fear, but in release. He raised Rosa’s can. He didn''t try
  to block the guilt; he poured all of it, every ounce of his sorrow and his love
  for Mia, into his intention. He pressed the nozzle.


  A blinding, golden cloud erupted from the can—the concentrated essence of Rosa’s
  hope mixed with the raw, jagged reality of Dante’s grief. The mixture didn''t neutralize
  the darkness; it overloaded it. The Hollow Man shrieked as the "Gold Standard" hit
  him, the pure, undiluted emotion acting like acid on his void-like form. He couldn''t
  digest the complexity of human redemption.


  The shadow shattered, exploding outward in a shockwave of light that knocked Dante
  flat. When the air cleared, the oppressive weight was gone. The boiler room was
  just a cold, dirty basement again. Kael lay unconscious, and the vortex had dissipated.


  Dante lay on the concrete, the empty can rolling from his hand. The guilt was still
  there, a familiar ache in his chest, but it no longer controlled him. He took a
  breath, clean and sharp, and pushed himself up to check on Silas.'
