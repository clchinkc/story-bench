output: 'The apartment was suffocatingly dark when Maya finally unlocked the door.
  She didn''t bother with the lights. What was the point? The gallery had officially
  closed its doors that morning, twenty years of her mother''s legacy reduced to a
  cold, empty shell and "LEASE AVAILABLE" signs taped to the glass.


  She sank onto the floorboards by the window, still wearing her coat. The city lights
  blurred through the glass—or maybe through her tears. She had tried everything.
  The crowdfunding had fallen short by thousands. The investors had walked away without
  a backward glance. Even her brother, her last ally, had finally stopped answering
  her calls.


  Her mother''s last painting hung on the wall opposite, barely visible in the gloom.
  It depicted a woman walking toward an unseen horizon, forever suspended in transition.
  Maya remembered sitting in the sterile hospice room, holding her mother''s cold
  hand, making a vow she couldn''t keep. "It''s not about the art," her mother had
  whispered, her voice fading. "It''s about having a place where people can feel something
  real."


  That place was gone now. Maya had failed that promise. She had failed her mother’s
  memory. She had failed herself.


  She pulled her knees to her chest, letting the silence swallow her whole. Outside,
  the city kept moving—cars, sirens, the relentless pulse of life—but in here, time
  had stopped. There was nothing left to do. No calls to make. No plans to execute.
  Just the crushing weight of everything she had lost pressing down on her chest,
  mimicking the stillness of death. There was no light here, only the long, empty
  night.'
