output: 'The segment effectively executes the "Dark Night of the Soul" beat. It follows
  the gallery closure (All Is Lost moment), shows Maya alone and isolated in darkness,
  captures genuine despair through her self-blame and failed promises, offers no solutions
  yet, and includes mortality reflections through her mother''s death. The emotional
  progression from loss to reflection to acceptance of defeat feels authentic and
  appropriately internal.
