output: "Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected\
  \ her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with\
  \ the car.\n\n\"How was Thailand?\" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.\n\
  \n\"Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos.\"\n\n\"And the meditation\
  \ retreat?\"\n\n\"It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly.\" Sophie glanced\
  \ at her phone, but instead of scrolling through emails, she put it away in her\
  \ bag. \"Linda needs me to call her tonight, but it can wait.\"\n\n\"That's a change,\"\
  \ her mother observed.\n\nSophie smiled. \"I realized that everything will be there\
  \ tomorrow. The Pearson account won't collapse if I don't respond right away.\"\
  \ \n\nThey drove in silence for a while. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through\
  \ the evening haze. Sophie's apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought\
  \ her morning latte. Everything exactly as she'd left it, yet subtly different.\n\
  \n\"It's good to be home,\" she said, feeling a sense of peace she hadn't expected.\
  \ As they approached her apartment, Sophie noticed the way the streetlights cast\
  \ a warm glow on the sidewalk, a detail she never used to see. Life went on, but\
  \ she was seeing it with new eyes."
