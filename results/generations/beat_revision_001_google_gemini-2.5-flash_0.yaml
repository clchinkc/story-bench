output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled, its voice a grating stone. "Stronger
  warriors have tried, but none carried the weight of a brother''s death like you.
  Did he die well, Kira? Or did he just… break?"


  The words struck Kira like a physical blow, tearing through her resolve. Her brother’s
  face, pale and still, flashed before her eyes. Guilt, a cold serpent, coiled in
  her gut. She remembered her last, harsh words to him, the argument that had driven
  him from the village, into the path of the very beasts she now hunted. She hadn''t
  just lost him; she had pushed him away. The dragon’s gaze seemed to pierce her soul,
  exposing every regret.


  She charged, but her movements were sluggish, burdened by sorrow. The dragon''s
  flame scorched her, its claws raked her shield, each strike echoing the crushing
  weight of her failure. She fell, not from impact, but from the sudden, overwhelming
  realization that she was fighting for a redemption she didn''t deserve. The chasm
  seemed to yawn beneath her, a gaping maw ready to swallow her despair. She lay there,
  defeated not by the dragon, but by the ghost of her past.


  Then, a flicker. Her brother’s face again, but this time, smiling. Not judging,
  but forgiving. He had died brave, protecting others. Her fight wasn''t about erasing
  her mistakes, but honoring his sacrifice. A new strength, clear and sharp, ignited
  within her. This wasn''t just about vengeance; it was about protecting what remained.


  With newfound purpose, she rose. When the dragon overextended on a strike, she saw
  her opening. With a cry that ripped free from her soul, she drove her sword through
  the gap in its scales, piercing its heart.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  exhausted but strangely light. The guilt was still there, a scar, but it no longer
  defined her. She had faced her deepest fear, and though it had nearly consumed her,
  she had found a way through.


  "He died well," she whispered, her voice steady. "And I will live better."'
