output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. "I was there when your brother
  died. I watched him bleed out calling your name. He wondered why you didn''t save
  him."


  The words hit like a physical blow. Every night for three years, Kira had replayed
  that moment—her failure, her helplessness, her brother''s final breath. The dragon
  wasn''t threatening her. It was unveiling the truth she''d never stopped running
  from.


  Kira''s legs gave way. She fell to her knees, the sword clattering beside her. This
  was the true ordeal—not fire and claw, but the weight of guilt finally given voice.
  She had carried her brother''s death like a stone around her heart, and now the
  dragon had cracked it open.


  Three times she had been knocked down during the battle. But this was different.
  This was death—not of her body, but of the girl who''d spent three years believing
  she was responsible, that if she''d been faster, stronger, better, he would have
  lived.


  The dragon''s eyes narrowed. "Stay down, child. There is nothing left for you but
  the grave."


  But Kira thought of her brother—not his death, but his life. His laughter. The way
  he protected her. The future he''d never have. And she understood, in that moment
  of darkness, that carrying his death wasn''t honoring him. It was betraying everything
  he''d meant.


  She rose. Not from guilt or rage, but from a purpose newly born. She would not fight
  for vengeance. She would fight for every moment he could never live—and prove his
  death hadn''t been meaningless.


  The dragon''s strike came fast, but her clarity was faster. She drove her blade
  through the gap in its scales, the same opening she''d waited for, but this time
  her arm wasn''t fueled by grief. It was steady with acceptance.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar.


  Kira stood over its body, victorious but fundamentally changed. She had faced her
  greatest fear—herself, her guilt, her false belief that she was responsible for
  what she couldn''t control.


  "I did it," she whispered. "I finally did it."


  Not the battle. Something far harder. She had forgiven herself.'
