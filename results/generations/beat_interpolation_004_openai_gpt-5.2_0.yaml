output: 'Thomas rose slowly, the way his father had taught him to stand when the room
  could turn on a single word. He kept his voice even as he faced Dr. Patricia Okonkwo.


  “Dr. Okonkwo, please state your former position at Meridian Pharmaceuticals.”


  “My—” Her hands tightened around the edge of the witness chair. “I was head of research.”


  “And in that role, were you responsible for overseeing the Phase III trials of Virexa?”


  A pause that lasted long enough for the jury to notice. “Yes.”


  Thomas laid the first binder on the rail. “I’m showing you what’s been marked as
  State’s Exhibit 38. Do you recognize these internal adverse-event summaries?”


  Her eyes flicked to the defense table. The CEO’s smile didn’t move, but it held.
  “I don’t,” she said, too quickly. “I can’t say those are Meridian documents.”


  A low stir passed through the gallery. Thomas felt it in his ribs, the sudden drop—six
  days of testimony, six days of careful scaffolding, and now the one witness who
  could anchor it was loosening every bolt.


  “Dr. Okonkwo,” he said, “you met with my office two weeks ago, correct?”


  “I—yes.”


  “And at that meeting, you told us Meridian altered trial endpoints after the first
  serious adverse reactions.”


  “No.” Her voice cracked on the single syllable. “I never said that.”


  The defense was on its feet. “Objection, Your Honor. Mischaracterizes—”


  “Sustained,” Judge Wright said, his expression unchanged. “Move on, Mr. Wright.”


  Thomas heard his own breath. If he moved on, the case would die politely, in compliance
  with procedure. He looked at the jury—watching, waiting for someone to admit what
  everyone already suspected—and then, despite the heat crawling up his neck, he looked
  once at his father. Stone. But present.


  Thomas turned back. “Your Honor, may we approach?”


  At sidebar, his voice dropped. “Judge, she’s under pressure. Meridian offered medical
  treatment to her family in exchange for silence. I need leave to examine bias and
  coercion.”


  The defense snapped, “Speculation.”


  Judge Wright’s gaze hardened, not at the lawyers but at the idea of bargaining with
  truth. “You may inquire. Carefully.”


  Back at the lectern, Thomas kept his hands visible. “Dr. Okonkwo, are you afraid
  to tell this jury what you know?”


  “No,” she whispered, then swallowed. “Yes.”


  “Is that fear related to an offer Meridian made regarding experimental treatment
  for your child?”


  Her eyes closed. For a moment it looked like she would deny it, like she would choose
  her daughter over seventeen strangers and let the courtroom swallow the lie.


  Thomas made the choice he couldn’t take back. “Dr. Okonkwo, look at me,” he said,
  the words cutting through the hush. “Meridian cannot be the only door. Not anymore.
  I can’t promise outcomes, but I can promise this: you will not be alone in finding
  another way.”


  The CEO’s smile finally faltered.


  Dr. Okonkwo opened her eyes. They were wet, furious, ashamed. “They told me,” she
  said, voice gaining strength, “that if I testified, my daughter would lose her place.
  They said people die every day, but a mother only gets one child.”


  Thomas didn’t let himself exhale. “And the documents in Exhibit 38—are they Meridian’s
  internal summaries?”


  “Yes,” she said, and the word landed like a gavel. “I wrote them. And I watched
  them get buried.”'
