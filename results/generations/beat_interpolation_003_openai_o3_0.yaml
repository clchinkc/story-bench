output: 'Yuki followed the corridor toward the crew quarters, the red emergency strips
  pulsing like a sluggish heartbeat. Doors stood open, bunks unmade, datapads mid-sentence.
  A half-finished chess game floated in zero-g where artificial gravity had momentarily
  failed, pieces drifting like debris in still water. She recorded everything: power
  levels stable, no hull breach, no biological contaminants flagged by her wrist scanner.
  Yet every room radiated a sudden-departure eeriness, as though forty-seven conversations
  had been cut with a single knife stroke.


  A metallic click echoed behind her. When she turned, the passage was empty—save
  for a ripple of distortion, air wobbling the way asphalt wavers on a hot day. The
  anomaly slid into the ceiling and vanished. Her pulse spiked. Hallucination? Teleporter
  lag? She filed it under “unknown” and pressed on.


  The medical bay lay two decks down. Its bulkhead was sealed by Level-Four quarantine.
  Manual override required simultaneous biometric confirmation from two senior officers—none
  were present, so Yuki improvised, hot-wiring the control panel with a fiber-optic
  patch and spoofing the signatures from stored personnel records. The lock disengaged
  with a mechanical sigh; sweat cooled on her neck. Obstacle solved, for now.


  Inside, holo-displays cycled unattended. Patient files showed baseline vitals suddenly
  spiking into impossible ranges: heart rates at eight beats per second, brainwaves
  stretching off the chart as if the subjects were “out of phase.” A lab coat lay
  crumpled beside the diagnostic bed, cuffs singed, fabric fused into a glassy fringe.
  On the wall someone had scrawled in marker: THEY’RE STILL HERE—JUST CAN’T TOUCH
  US.


  Movement flickered at the edge of her vision. Three shimmer-forms hovered near the
  storage cabinets, silhouettes human-shaped yet transparent, sparks cascading within
  like miniature nebulae. The temperature dropped; exhaled breath crystallized. Instinct
  urged retreat, but her mission demanded data. She raised her scanner, capturing
  spectral readings until the figures coalesced into a single surge of static and
  blinked out, leaving instruments screaming with interference.


  The logs referenced “Lab Seven—Phase Confirmation.” Heart pounding, Yuki set a course
  for the research wing. Whatever had swallowed the crew, the answer waited there—and
  she would not leave without it.'
