output: 'Morning found the village still damp with night, the bell on Marcus’s curiosity
  shop door giving a tired jangle as Elena slipped inside with the map hugged to her
  chest. Glass cases held knives that had forgotten their wars, jars of odd sand,
  a coil of rope that looked like it had a story. Marcus himself emerged from behind
  a curtain, gray at the temples, a scar lifting one eyebrow as if permanently skeptical.


  “I’m returning this,” she said, setting the glowing map on the counter. “To someone
  more qualified.”


  He didn’t touch it. He studied her grip instead. “You catalogued it in your head
  on the way here, didn’t you? The sequence of runes, the marginal symbols.”


  She flushed. “Occupational hazard.”


  “Occupational asset,” he corrected. “You read structures. You notice what others
  skim past. Forests and old magics respect careful readers.”


  She almost laughed. “I annotate in pencil. That hardly helps with haunted trees.”


  He turned, rummaging until he produced a worn leather satchel and set it between
  them. “It helps more than a sword when you need it most. Rope, chalk, mirror, tinder,
  thread, paper. Mark your path. Leave notes for yourself. Ask precise questions.
  Don’t bargain until you understand the index.”


  He laid a brass compass in her palm. The needle refused to settle. “This won’t point
  north. It listens to your aim, not your fear. The forest tests intentions, not abilities.
  Trust what you know, not what you fear you lack.”


  Her chest tightened. “And you’ll come show me how to use it?”


  He smiled without humor and tapped his knee. “I’ve done my crossings. Mine cost
  what yours shouldn’t. I won’t walk it for you.”


  Elena fastened the satchel with fingers that shook less than she expected. She was
  still ordinary. She was also the person who remembered footnotes and returned books
  on time. Maybe that counted.


  Outside, the trees on the horizon looked farther than they were. She traced a rune
  in pencil on scrap paper, tucked it away, and stepped into the day.'
