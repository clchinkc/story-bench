output: "Elena found the curiosity shop tucked between a bakery and a shuttered tailor’s\
  \ shop, its sign creaking in the dawn wind: *MARCUS’S MARVELOUS MERCHANDISE*. She\
  \ hesitated, fingers brushing the frayed strap of her satchel, until the door swung\
  \ open on its own.  \n\nA bell jingled. A man leaned against the counter, silver-haired\
  \ and weathered as a well-thumbed book, polishing a tarnished astrolabe. “Morning,”\
  \ he said, as if she’d kept an appointment. “Tea?” He gestured to a chipped mug\
  \ steaming beside him.  \n\nElena blinked. “You know who I am.”  \n\n“Knew your\
  \ grandmother. Fine woman. Terrible poker player.” He set the astrolabe down. “Marcus,\
  \ at your service.” He eyed her coat, still dusted with night-fog. “You’ve seen\
  \ the map. Refused the call. Smart girl.”  \n\nShe stiffened. “How—”  \n\n“Ran a\
  \ shop for thirty years, child. People talk. *You* talk. Loudly, when agitated.”\
  \ He slid a parcel across the counter—worn leather, familiar stitching. Her grandmother’s\
  \ satchel. “Take it. You’ll need it.”  \n\nInside, she found a brass compass, a\
  \ vial of ink that shimmered like starlight, and a journal filled with her grandmother’s\
  \ cramped notes. “You’re a librarian,” Marcus said, watching her rifled pages. “You\
  \ think that’s useless?” He tapped the compass. “That needle doesn’t point north.\
  \ Points to the truest version of yourself. Useless unless you know how to read.”\
  \  \n\nElena swallowed. “I don’t know what I’m doing.”  \n\n“Neither does the river—still\
  \ carves canyons.” He pressed a wax-sealed scroll into her hands. “Rules of the\
  \ Thornwood. Survival’s less about swords and more about patterns. You’re good with\
  \ patterns, aren’t you?”  \n\nShe thought of cataloging systems, of stories that\
  \ demanded order. The compass trembled in her grip, then steadied.  \n\n“Your grandmother\
  \ believed in you.” Marcus stepped back, fading into the shop’s shadowed shelves.\
  \ “Don’t need to be a hero. Just be the right person.”  \n\nThe words lingered as\
  \ she left, the weight of the satchel a quiet promise. The forest waited, but so\
  \ did the possibility that being *herself* might be enough."
