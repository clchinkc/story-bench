output: 'The station unfolded like a derelict city welded to the stars. Jin navigated
  corridors choked with makeshift hydroponics and the sharp tang of recycled air,
  a far cry from Earth’s sterilized labs. The Collective wasn''t a unified haven,
  but a patchwork of factions: pragmatic engineers, anarchist communes, and cynical
  traders who eyed him, a notorious fugitive, with suspicion or avarice. His "asylum"
  felt precarious, contingent on proving his worth. He searched for allies, for a
  foothold, his Earthbound idealism clashing with orbital pragmatism. Safety wasn’t
  given; it was bartered.


  He found an unexpected guide in Astrid, a gaunt woman with eyes that held the cold
  light of distant stars. Once a Council materials scientist, she’d fled decades prior.
  She became his reluctant mentor within the pressurized chaos. "They tolerate dissidents
  here, boy," she rasped over synth-caf in her cluttered module, walls plastered with
  schematics of failed terraforming projects. "But tolerance is not trust. Your value
  lies in what you brought." She meant the data, the proof of suppression. But Astrid
  probed deeper, cross-referencing Jin’s leaked files with obscure orbital research
  logs. One night, her bony finger jabbed a screen. "See? The polymorphic catalyst
  in your carbon capture matrix… its resonance frequency. It’s not just for scrubbing
  CO2." Her voice dropped. "It’s a near-perfect harmonic dampener. For fusion containment."


  The revelation struck Jin like decompression. The Council didn’t just suppress a
  solution for Earth; they suppressed the key to stable, compact fusion reactors –
  the very power source that could make the Collective truly energy-independent, a
  threat Earth couldn''t ignore. He hadn’t just leaked scandal; he’d smuggled out
  a technological skeleton key. He found what he thought he wanted: leverage. With
  Astrid’s connections, he accessed a low-bandwidth broadcast array controlled by
  the Promethean faction, engineers hungry for the fusion breakthrough. He could expose
  the suppression *and* arm the Collective. Safety through strength, a platform amplified.


  But the cost came due swiftly. Broadcasting the fusion implications required bypassing
  the station’s cautious comms council. Jin took action, manipulating Astrid’s old
  access codes she’d entrusted him with, overriding protocols. The signal pulsed out
  towards the Free Orbitals. Success tasted like ozone. Then, the heavy tread of station
  security echoed outside Astrid’s module. They hadn’t come for him. They came for
  *her*. "Unauthorized core system access. Violation of Collective network integrity
  statutes," the lead officer intoned. Astrid met Jin’s horrified gaze, her expression
  weary, unsurprised. She’d known the risk of trusting an Earther, of using her privileges.
  She offered no defense as they clamped restraints on her thin wrists. Jin stood
  frozen, the weight of his freedom crushing down – bought with the liberty of the
  only person who’d truly helped him navigate the stars. He had his platform, his
  weapon against Earth. But the silence after they took Astrid away was the loudest
  sound he’d ever heard, the first true cost of his war etched in her absence.'
