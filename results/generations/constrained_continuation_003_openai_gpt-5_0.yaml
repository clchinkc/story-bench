output: 'Processing felt less like arrival and more like negotiation for the right
  to breathe. Jin stood in a line that was really a circle, a queue-less queue where
  people raised their hands and took turns speaking into a mic suspended from the
  ceiling. The woman at the center, gray braids gathered in a coil, introduced herself
  as Jessa Anwar, Environmental Systems coordinator for Segment Twelve. She wore a
  jumpsuit stained with algae and steel dust; he trusted that more than any tailored
  suit he’d seen on Earth.


  “You know what you are doing puts our trade at risk,” she said after the forms and
  bioscan, after the murmurs that followed the word “treason.”


  “I know I can’t go back,” he said. “And I know what I leaked is true.”


  Jessa nodded once and gestured to the wall where a holo was projected: the Collective’s
  Charter. No extradition was item one. Item two was less famous. Equitable contribution
  for all.


  “Air is politics here,” she said. “So is water, light, debug time, faucet minutes.
  You’ll work enviro cycles. You’ll pay your airclock like everyone else. And you’ll
  learn when to speak in the Agora and when to keep your head down.”


  She became his first anchor in a place that resisted anchors. The Collective used
  a reputation ledger instead of money, votes stacked by rotating facilitators instead
  of presidents, mediation circles instead of courts—except when they didn’t. Rules
  bent around supply shipments, around helium-3 quotas, around the whisper that a
  certain state was threatening “inspection” of a transfer node if the Collective
  didn’t play nice. Jin’s presence was a complication nobody needed.


  The first week, he missed three stacks in the Agora because he didn’t know you had
  to ping the bot hours in advance. He called a councilor a “manager” and watched
  a room flinch. He tried to shake hands in a module where touch was a specific ritual
  negotiated beforehand. He learned to speak in proposals and to label his certainty
  as a hypothesis. He learned how much time you owed for a light left on.


  Jessa was deliberate with him. She took him to the lungs of Segment Twelve: columns
  of bubbling bioreactors, coils of sorbent piping, additive prints curing under ultraviolet
  lamps. “You’ll be with materials,” she said. “You know sorbents; we keep the CO2
  at 400 ppm in here because algae get cranky if we don’t. You’ve read your own papers?”


  He had. He’d expected hostility; he hadn’t expected to be handed a toolkit and told
  to fix a sticky valve.


  By the second week, he discovered that the Collective’s independence wasn’t built
  on believes alone. It ran on contracts. The Council had done more than bury a tech;
  it had turned restraint into a commodity. Earth governments bought orbital capture
  credits from the Collective to satisfy their sustainability targets. If the breakthrough
  went public and diffuse, if every megacity could grow carbon capture foam in its
  sewers, that market would collapse. The free stations would lose their largest clean
  revenue stream.


  “You’re not the only one with enemies,” Jessa said, watching his face as he scrolled
  through the contract library. “You’re not the only one with leverage, either.”


  In a materials lab that smelled vaguely of almonds, Jin found what he hadn’t known
  he was looking for. The prototype in front of him wasn’t his chemistry; it was his
  chemistry reimagined for microgravity. The foams had grown in crystalline lattices
  the way they never did in full gravity—branching into fractal filigrees that tripled
  surface area and absorbed CO2 like a hungry lung. Someone had coded a deposition
  script named Y.L._GRO that toggled growth cycles on a ten-second cadence. He didn’t
  have to guess whose initials those were. Yuna had always liked to sneer at his filenames.


  “Where did you get this?” His voice shook despite himself.


  “Pieces came in over a year,” Jessa said. “Public preprints, private hints. A few
  whispers on the inter-hab exchange. We’ve been prototyping quietly. We were waiting
  for a vote on how much to show and when.”


  The unexpected realization cut both ways. The tech he’d hoped to free wasn’t just
  a climate fix; up here, it was productive power. Printed into carbon composites,
  it could make beams stronger, shells tighter, craft lighter. On Earth it meant reprieve.
  In orbit it meant independence with teeth.


  The Agora listened when Jessa stood beside him and vouched for his understanding
  of the science. With her backing, he found what he thought he wanted: a platform.
  A research cell with access to printers and grid time, a channel to stream lab feeds
  to the Agora, a scheduled hearing on the ethics of release. It felt, for the first
  time since the elevator, like safety that did not taste like fear.


  Then the offers arrived. A Syndicate for Vacuum Manufacturing proposed a contract
  that would give him immunity from mobility restrictions if he agreed to embargo
  microgravity optimizations for a year. A mutual aid bloc from Three and Four promised
  communal protection if he pushed for full, immediate disclosure. A quiet message
  from a trade liaison reminded him that Earth had inspectors and the Collective had
  weak points.


  “Your call,” Jessa said, as they hung upside down fixing a kink in a duct. “But
  not just your call. We live with the fallout together.”


  His fingers were numb, his checklist full of half-done. The moral algebra refused
  to balance. To shove everything open meant risking sanction on the stations—if Earth
  lost its credits it would find other pressure points. To keep anything closed meant
  leaving civilians under skies he’d helped measure, breathing air that didn’t have
  to be so hot.


  He compromised. He masked the Y.L._GRO module out of the initial release, stripping
  the ten-second cadence that made orbital growth sing. He pushed the terrestrial-optimized
  schemas into the Agora with a petition to propagate them to every groundside lab
  that could use them. He wrote a note to the Assembly: this is enough to pull us
  back from the brink; the rest can wait until we can protect the people who will
  be punished for it.


  The petition passed narrowly. The code went live across the Collective’s mesh. Earth’s
  public nets lit with mirrors before the Council could swat them down. And the consequence
  arrived within a day: his residency status shifted to Probationary. The manufacturing
  bloc called him a free rider for gutting orbital leverage. A cluster of radicals
  called him a coward for keeping anything back. Jessa lost a committee chair because
  she had stood with him; she smiled when the vote tally posted, but her eyes were
  exhausted.


  He had gained a lab with a door that slid open to voice and a window that looked
  out on a thin blue line he had chosen to leave. He had paid for it with time on
  an airclock that ticked louder, with a narrowed corridor map, with the knowledge
  that he had used the same logic of partial truths his enemies had once used on him.'
