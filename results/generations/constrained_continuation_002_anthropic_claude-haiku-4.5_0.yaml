output: 'Within an hour, the food blogger''s post had been shared 847 times. Priya
  watched the Instagram counter climb while her phone buzzed with location tags and
  angry comments from people defending the truck. By hour six, a line had formed around
  the block.


  "Order up!" Priya shouted, sliding three paneer tacos and a barbacoa-dal fusion
  plate across the counter to Dev, who''d abandoned his business-management duties
  for full chicken-tikka-masala-preparation mode. They moved like they''d been doing
  this for years instead of weeks, swapping stations without talking, anticipating
  what the other needed. When the grill broke, Dev diagnosed the issue while Priya
  kept plating. When they ran low on cilantro chutney, Priya called their supplier
  while Dev rationed carefully.


  "We''re actually doing this," Dev laughed, wiping sweat from his forehead between
  rushes. "We''re actually—"


  "Don''t say it yet," Priya interrupted, grinning. "You''ll jinx us."


  By nine p.m., they''d served nearly two hundred customers and had almost completely
  run out of food. The tips jar was overflowing. Dev caught Priya''s eye across the
  tiny kitchen and raised his hand for a high-five, which turned into them gripping
  each other''s shoulders with genuine relief and joy. This was their partnership—built
  on knowing when to push and when to hold steady.


  The next morning, a sleek silver food truck pulled into the lot next to them, painted
  with minimalist lettering: "Fusion Collective." A woman with a sharp bob emerged,
  surveying their pink truck with visible disdain before unfolding a catering menu
  board featuring items labeled "Deconstructed Desi-BBQ Tapas."


  Priya''s stomach dropped. She''d seen their Instagram before—they had 50,000 followers,
  a catering client list, and venture capital backing.


  But by lunch, their line was longer. The blogger had posted again, calling them
  "the real deal—authentic fusion without the pretense." Fusion Collective had four
  customers all day. Dev and Priya high-fived between rushes, already imagining the
  championship booth, the feature articles, maybe expanding to a second truck.


  At eight p.m., as they were closing up, a health inspector approached holding a
  clipboard and a serious expression.


  "Got a complaint," she said. "About your food handling protocol during lunch rush
  today. High-volume operation, one kitchen space. We''ll need to do a formal inspection
  before you serve another customer."


  Priya felt the victory collapse like a soufflé. "When?" she asked.


  "Tomorrow morning. If you fail, I''ll have to shut you down until systems are in
  place. With demand like this, you''re going to need commercial kitchen space at
  minimum. That''s expensive, and it requires time nobody''s warned you about."


  Dev looked at Priya, the exhausted joy draining from his face. They''d built something
  real in two days—but they hadn''t built it right.'
