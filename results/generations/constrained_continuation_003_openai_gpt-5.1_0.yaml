output: 'Jin floated for a moment between worlds, boots just above the mag-strips
  of the arrival bay. The elevator hatch irised shut behind him with a final metallic
  sigh, severing the last physical link to the planet below. Ahead, a ring-shaped
  corridor spun slow enough that he felt a hesitant tug toward its floor, simulated
  gravity slowly asserting itself.


  Processing was a glass-walled chamber overlooking the blue-white curve of Earth.
  A line of newcomers snaked toward kiosks where cameras and scanners tracked every
  twitch. Some wore patched flight suits, others smartweave business jackets with
  corporate logos he didn''t recognize. No one met his eyes for long.


  "Name?" the kiosk asked, voice flat.


  "Jin Park."


  The screen flickered, cross-referencing something. The machine paused long enough
  that he heard his own breathing.


  "Status: Special intake. Please wait."


  The others in line pretended not to notice the tiny tilt of heads his way, the way
  conversations faltered and resumed in lower registers. A door slid open at his left.


  A woman in a charcoal jumpsuit waited inside, hair cropped close, silver threaded
  through black. Her face had the exhausted calm of someone who''d spent too many
  years arguing in bad rooms.


  "Jin Park," she said. "I''m Mira al-Karim. Liaison to Earth refugees. Walk with
  me."


  The corridor curved, stars slipping in and out of view through narrow ports as they
  moved. Murals scrolled along the inner wall—protest scenes, labor strikes in orbit,
  a painting of Pacific shorelines swallowed by ocean.


  "This isn''t what I expected," Jin said. "I thought…it would be less organized."


  Mira''s mouth twitched. "People hear ''Collective'' and picture a commune in the
  sky. This place runs on air budgets and orbital mechanics. Anarchism without accounting
  is just suffocation."


  They passed a cluster of kiosks where traders haggled over bandwidth allocations
  and water rights, numbers streaming beside their faces. A nearby wall display showed
  the latest vote tallies from the Station Forum: green bars, red bars, a pulsing
  amber warning labeled EXTRADITION PRECEDENT – DEBATE.


  "That''s about me," Jin said.


  "That''s about us," Mira corrected. "Earth''s offering better launch subsidies if
  we hand you over quietly. Some here think we can''t afford to say no."


  His stomach lurched, whether from gravity fluctuations or fear he couldn''t tell.
  "But your charter—"


  "Charters are pressure-tested when survival''s on the line." She glanced at him.
  "Tell me: did you leak for the people who''d suffer on Earth, or for the elegance
  of being morally consistent?"


  He flinched. "For the people. For my parents. For…everyone."


  "Good. You''ll need to remember that when purity stops being useful."


  Processing, it turned out, was less a single room than a gauntlet. He sat through
  a medical scan, a psychological interview conducted by a soft-spoken synth avatar,
  a financial disclosure where he admitted he owned nothing but the clothes they''d
  let him keep. Each station stamped a different color into the side of his temporary
  ID band.


  At political intake, three delegates evaluated him from behind a semicircle desk.
  One wore the blue sash of the Life Support Cooperative, another a plain black collar
  indicating direct democracy bloc, the third a subtle pin marking some corporate
  consortium Jin didn''t recognize.


  Blue Sash spoke first. "We do not extradite," she said. "But neither do we exist
  to launder Earth''s dissidents. Why should we risk sanctions for you?"


  "Because the tech I leaked could repair the atmosphere you all depend on," Jin said.
  "Even up here, you need a livable planet beneath you. They chose profit over survival."


  Black Collar leaned forward. "And what did you choose when you kept the core algorithms
  encrypted? Your leak exposed the Council, yes, but it didn''t give the world the
  tools."


  Jin''s throat tightened. "We were still analyzing long-term effects. Yuna—my partner—insisted
  we understand the unintended consequences before opening it. I agreed."


  Corporate Pin watched him with a predator''s patience. "Then perhaps your arrival
  is less a rescue than an offer. We have fabrication capacity the surface can only
  dream of. In the right hands, your breakthrough could become…decisive."


  Mira cut in. "The question for today is status. Asylum, probationary. He''s a political
  target, not just an asset."


  After more debate than he could track, they stamped a final mark on his band: TEMPORARY
  PROTECTED PERSON. No vote on extradition yet. No guarantee, either.


  Later, in a cramped observation nook, Mira handed him a slim tablet. Through the
  viewport, Earth hung half-shadowed, storms veining the oceans.


  "This is your research archive," she said. "The copy Yuna pushed through the mesh
  before your warrant hit. We decrypted the outer layer."


  Jin hesitated before opening it. Familiar datasets blossomed: atmospheric models,
  sorbent nanofiber schematics, deployment protocols. Then he saw a folder labeled
  ORBITAL APPLICATIONS—DERIVED.


  "I didn''t write this," he said.


  "We did," Mira replied. "Well, our environmental systems teams. Your leak reached
  us months ago through back channels. We ran it against our own CO₂ scrubber work.
  Jin, your process isn''t just better at pulling carbon from air. Up here, with concentrated
  exhaust from life support and ship drives, it''s orders of magnitude more efficient."


  "You''ve already used it?"


  "On a limited scale. Closed loops, controlled environments." She tapped a subfile.
  Projections unfolded—planetary graphs, timelines of CO₂ decline. Some curves plunged
  too fast, crossing red danger bands labeled RAPID COOLING, AGRICULTURAL FAILURE.


  "It can work," she said softly. "But deployed at full tilt on Earth, without coordination,
  you don''t get salvation. You get climate whiplash. Famines. Migration crises worse
  than anything we''ve seen."


  Jin stared at the models until the lines blurred. All his righteous anger at the
  Council met this new, colder terror. "So they were right to suppress it?"


  "They were right to be afraid," Mira said. "They were wrong to hide it, to keep
  power centralized. Fear and greed made the same choice for different reasons."


  He thought of coastal slums flooding, of children breathing ash-thick air. Of Yuna
  insisting, again and again, We can''t just drop this and walk away. Someone has
  to guide it.


  "What do I do from here?" he asked.


  "You said you wanted to keep fighting," Mira said. "The Collective can give you
  a lab, a network, a voice in our Forum. Safety, more or less. But there''s a condition."


  Of course there was. "What kind?"


  "You hold the deepest keys. The core algorithms, the deployment governors. If you
  broadcast them openly to Earth now, every state, every corporation, every warlord
  with a data uplink will race to be first. No safeguards. No coordination. We''ll
  be watching an uncontrolled experiment from a tin can."


  He already knew where this was going. "You want me to give the keys to the Collective
  instead."


  "We want stewardship," Mira said. "We become one of several gatekeepers. We negotiate
  with Earth on equal footing—access in exchange for enforceable deployment conditions.
  It protects you, and it protects a few billion people who don''t know your name."


  "And it puts the power I tried to tear away from the Council into another elite''s
  hands," Jin said. "Into your hands."


  Mira didn''t flinch. "Yes. The difference is, our charter is public. Our votes are
  recorded. If we betray that trust, you can expose us from the inside. But you can''t
  un-trigger a runaway climate cascade."


  Silence stretched. Through the glass, a sunrise blade carved across Earth''s edge,
  staining clouds gold. Jin imagined Yuna in some interrogation room, still stubborn,
  still insisting on open science. He tasted the word betrayal like metal.


  "If I agree," he said, "what happens to me?"


  "You get permanent asylum," Mira answered. "A research berth with Life Support Co-op.
  A guaranteed seat at any Forum session concerning your work. And Earth will call
  you a traitor twice over—once for the leak, once for siding with us. Your parents…"
  She let the sentence die. "Sanctions will harden. You will not be going home."


  If he refused, if he dumped everything into the open net from this station, he might
  die an uncompromised idealist in some accidental airlock mishap, and the tech might
  eat'
