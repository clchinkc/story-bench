output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. "Your brother was stronger, and
  *he* tried. His blood is on your hands."


  The words struck deeper than flame. Kira''s grip faltered. She saw her brother''s
  face again—his trust as he''d followed her into the Shadowlands. The dragon''s next
  words mirrored her own guilt: "You led him here. You failed him."


  The dragon''s tail swept her legs. She hit the stone, breath gone. *He''s dead because
  of you.* She rose.


  Claws raked her shield, sending her sprawling. *You should have died instead.* She
  rose.


  Flame scorched her armor, melting the pauldron. *You don''t deserve to win.* She
  rose—but this time, her arms trembled not from exhaustion, but from the weight of
  truth. The dragon had become her own self-hatred made manifest.


  When the beast lunged, Kira didn''t dodge. She dropped her sword.


  In that surrender, the dragon''s jaws closed on emptiness. Kira caught its descending
  maw with both hands, her palms burning against obsidian scales. "Yes," she whispered.
  "I failed him. But I will not fail everyone else by letting you win."


  The dragon shrieked as her acceptance became its undoing. Its own shadow turned
  against it, coiling into its heart.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  victorious but exhausted.


  She understood now: victory wasn''t erasing her guilt, but fighting despite it.
  She retrieved her sword and began the long walk back, carrying both her failure
  and her purpose.'
