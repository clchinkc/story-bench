  "Cook what you want."


  Maya looked up from her notebook, where she''d been planning next week''s menus
  with military precision. Alejandro stood in the kitchen doorway, still wearing the
  gray sweater she''d only seen him in once before—the color of old stones, of things
  that had weathered storms. His hands were in his pockets, his posture guarded as
  always, but something in his voice had shifted.


  "Within reason," he added quickly. "I know you have guidelines."


  She didn''t point out that the guidelines were his own. That according to Lucia,
  she wasn''t supposed to cook anything he''d never eaten before, wasn''t supposed
  to experiment, wasn''t supposed to "venture outside the parameters of established
  preferences." The parameters were a wall, and she was beginning to understand that
  walls worked both ways.


  "What do you want?" she asked softly.


  The question hung between them. For a long moment, he said nothing, and she watched
  something flicker behind his eyes—a vulnerability he shuttered almost immediately.


  "I don''t know anymore," he admitted quietly. "I haven''t known for a very long
  time."


  Maya set down her pencil. The professional distance she''d maintained for three
  months—efficient, proper, invisible—cracked somewhere in her chest. She thought
  of the seven chefs before her, all of whom had fled. Perhaps they''d never asked
  him what he wanted. Perhaps they''d been too afraid of the man with the cold reputation
  to look closer.


  "Tonight," she said slowly, "I''m going to make you something I''ve never made before.
  And you''re going to tell me if it''s what you wanted, even if you don''t know what
  that is yet."


  She expected him to refuse. Expected the wall to go back up, the dismissal, the
  door closing with that terrible finality she sometimes heard in the silence between
  them.


  Instead, he nodded once and pulled out a chair at the kitchen table.


  Maya moved through the kitchen with purpose, but her hands trembled slightly as
  she gathered ingredients. She chose a dish from her grandmother''s repertoire— saffron
  rice with seafood, the kind of meal that took time, that demanded patience, that
  couldn''t be rushed. As she worked, she felt his eyes on her, watching with the
  quiet intensity of a man who had learned to notice everything because noticing was
  safer than feeling.


  When she finally served him, she sat down across the table rather than retreating
  to the periphery as she always did. The silence stretched, comfortable and strange
  all at once.


  He took a bite and closed his eyes.


  Something in his face shifted—a softening around the edges that she''d never seen
  before. When he opened his eyes again, they were brighter than she expected.


  "My mother made this," he said. His voice was barely a whisper. "She made this on
  Sundays, when I was young. Before—"


  He stopped, jaw tightening. But Maya understood. Before whatever had closed him
  off, before the fame and the isolation and the relentless parade of people who wanted
  something from him. Before the world had taught him that love was transactional
  and trust was weakness.


  "Maya." Her name in his mouth had become something new. "Why are you still here?"


  She considered the question seriously. The salary that could save her grandmother''s
  restaurant. The contract that required nothing more than showing up and cooking.
  Six months of safe distance, of professional boundaries, of protecting herself from
  a man who was impossible to reach.


  But she thought of how he''d watched her eat dinner alone in this kitchen every
  night for three months. How he always emerged when she was cooking, hovering at
  the periphery, never quite daring to enter the room. She thought of the way he said
  please and thank you to everyone—gardeners, housekeepers, Lucia—except his words
  always carried the weight of command.


  "I don''t know," she admitted. "But I''m not leaving."


  The evening light was turning gold outside the window, and for a moment, neither
  of them moved. The contract between them had just quietly transformed into something
  else entirely—a choice, not an obligation. A desire, not a duty.


  And in that moment, Maya understood that she was no longer working for the salary.
  She was staying for him.'
