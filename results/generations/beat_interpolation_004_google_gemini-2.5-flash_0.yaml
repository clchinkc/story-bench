output: '"Dr. Okonkwo," Thomas began, his voice steady, "for the record, can you state
  your former position at Meridian Pharmaceuticals?"


  "Head of Research and Development," she replied, her voice soft but clear.


  He guided her through the initial stages, establishing her expertise and access.
  Then, he moved to the heart of the matter. "Dr. Okonkwo, during your tenure, did
  you become aware of any internal documents suggesting that Meridian''s drug, Viridian,
  had serious, undisclosed side effects?"


  She hesitated, her gaze flickering to the defense table where Mr. Thorne, Meridian''s
  CEO, maintained his predatory smile. Her hands, clasped tightly in her lap, trembled
  almost imperceptibly. "There were... concerns," she managed, her voice barely a
  whisper.


  "Concerns?" Thomas pressed, his tone gentle but firm. "Were these ''concerns'' documented?
  Did they indicate a pattern of adverse reactions, including fatalities, far exceeding
  what was reported to regulatory bodies?"


  Dr. Okonkwo swallowed hard, her eyes wide with a desperate, trapped animal fear.
  She looked at the judge, then at the silent gallery, finally settling on Thomas.
  For a long moment, the courtroom held its breath, sensing the precipice. Her lips
  parted, and it seemed she was about to utter a retraction, a carefully worded denial
  that would unravel everything.


  Thomas saw it. He didn''t interrupt. Instead, he took a slow, deliberate breath,
  and when he spoke, his voice was not accusatory, but imbued with a profound understanding.
  "Dr. Okonkwo," he said, "you are a scientist. A healer. You know the cost of silence.
  You know the weight of truth. What is the truth, Dr. Okonkwo?"


  Her gaze locked with his, and for an instant, the fear warred with something else—a
  flicker of professional integrity, a mother''s fierce protectiveness, a human''s
  deep-seated need for honesty. Her shoulders straightened almost imperceptibly. "Yes,"
  she choked out, tears welling. "Yes, they were documented. The reports... they showed
  seventeen deaths. Meridian suppressed them. I have the copies."


  A gasp rippled through the gallery. Thomas simply nodded, a silent acknowledgment
  of the immense courage it had taken. Mr. Thorne’s smile evaporated, replaced by
  a mask of impotent fury. The gavel remained silent. The truth, finally, was out.'
