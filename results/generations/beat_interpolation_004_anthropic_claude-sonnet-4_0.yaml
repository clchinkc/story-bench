output: 'Thomas rose, his hands steady despite the weight of everything hanging in
  the balance. "Dr. Okonkwo, please state your position at Meridian Pharmaceuticals."


  "I was—" Her voice cracked. She glanced toward the defense table, then at something
  in the gallery Thomas couldn''t see. "I was head of research."


  "And did you review the clinical trial data for Cardiozine?"


  A long pause. Too long. "The data showed..." She stopped, her hands trembling. "The
  initial data was—was within acceptable parameters."


  Thomas felt the case slipping away. The jury shifted uncomfortably. Behind him,
  he heard his co-counsel''s sharp intake of breath.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," Thomas said gently, "are you comfortable continuing this testimony?"


  She looked up, startled. In that moment, he saw everything—a mother''s desperation,
  a scientist''s integrity torn in half.


  Thomas made his choice. He walked closer, lowering his voice so only she could hear.
  "Your daughter''s name is Maya, isn''t it?"


  Dr. Okonkwo''s eyes widened.


  "Eight years old. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia." Thomas''s voice was barely a whisper.
  "I have a daughter too. And I want you to know—whatever you say here today, I will
  personally ensure Maya gets into the Johns Hopkins trial. No conditions. No quid
  pro quo. Just one parent helping another."


  The courtroom was dead silent, sensing something crucial happening though they couldn''t
  hear the words.


  Dr. Okonkwo stared at him, tears gathering. "Why?"


  "Because seventeen other children died. And because Maya deserves a father who chose
  truth over fear."


  She closed her eyes, and when she opened them, Thomas saw the scientist again—not
  the terrified mother.


  "The data," she said clearly, her voice carrying across the courtroom now, "showed
  seventeen deaths directly linked to Cardiozine. We buried the reports. Marcus Holloway
  ordered us to falsify the trial results." Her voice grew stronger with each word.
  "I have the original documents. All of them."


  The defense attorney shot to his feet, objecting frantically, but it was too late.


  The truth was out.'
