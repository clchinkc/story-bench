output: 'Rachel Torres sat at her kitchen table in her Queens apartment, jazz playing
  softly from the speaker as Sherlock wound between her ankles. The tabby had arrived
  at a crime scene two years ago—traumatized, refusing to leave. She''d brought him
  home. Now he was the closest thing to routine her life had.


  Tuesday morning in October. She scrolled through her email, coffee cooling beside
  her laptop. A cold case file sat in her bag—it always did. Even at home on ordinary
  mornings, she couldn''t let it go.


  Her phone buzzed. James.


  "You see the brief on the Hargrove thing?" His voice came through crisp, professional,
  but with that edge of familiarity they''d built over three years together.


  "Reading it now."


  "Yeah? I was thinking—"


  "Your instinct or mine?"


  A pause. Then he laughed. "That''s why we work. Meet at the precinct?"


  She ended the call. Sherlock jumped onto the table, exactly where cats shouldn''t
  be. She scratched behind his ears anyway—a small moment in the chaos of twelve years
  on the force. Twelve years of following leads that went nowhere, of chasing ghosts
  other detectives had abandoned.


  The Riverside Precinct wouldn''t be busy yet. Tuesday mornings rarely were. The
  neighborhood had stayed relatively stable for years, property crimes ticking up
  but nothing catastrophic. Ordinary. Routine.


  She grabbed her bag, left the jazz playing for no one, and headed for the door.


  That was when her department phone rang—an internal call she didn''t recognize.'
