output: 'The passage Tomás led her through was a seam in the stone, barely wide enough
  for her shoulders. Behind them, the Scorpion Guild''s shouts echoed through the
  tunnels, growing fainter as they pressed deeper into the earth. The air grew thick
  and stale, carrying the weight of centuries.


  "Stop," Zara hissed, grabbing Tomás''s arm. Her fingers found the barely perceptible
  indentation in the wall—a pressure plate. "This whole section is trapped."


  Tomás''s face went pale in the torchlight. "How can you tell?"


  "Feel the air. It''s moving wrong." She crouched, studying the floor''s pattern
  of worn stones. "Someone''s been here before. Someone who knew how to set these
  without triggering them." She traced her fingers along mortar lines, finding the
  safe path. "Stay exactly where I step."


  The next hundred paces were agony. Every stone felt like it might be her last. Zara''s
  thief instincts screamed warnings her mind couldn''t process. She''d survived on
  instinct before, but this was different—this was deliberate, calculated death waiting
  in stone and shadow.


  "Why does the Scorpion Guild want the map so badly?" she asked, concentrating on
  each step.


  Tomás''s silence stretched too long. When he finally spoke, his voice was hollow.
  "Because they know what you''re looking for isn''t just knowledge. The Sunken Library...
  it''s not just books down there."


  Zara froze mid-step. "What do you mean?"


  "The cure you seek. It''s not theoretical, Zara. It''s... active. The Library houses
  living things—creatures of pure knowledge that can rewrite flesh and bone. The Guild
  wants to weaponize them." He swallowed hard. "My brother died because of their experiments.
  I helped you because I thought... if anyone could reach the Library safely, it would
  be someone who moves like shadow."


  The weight of his confession settled between them like a stone. "You used me."


  "I hoped to use you. There''s a difference."


  Ahead, the tunnel opened into a vast chamber carved from black stone. At its center
  stood a circular pool of still water, reflecting nothing. Ancient symbols lined
  the walls, pulsing with a faint, organic light. The Approach had become the Ordeal.


  "Tomás, look." The water in the pool was rising, spilling over its carved rim. But
  it wasn''t water—it was ink, thick and black, seeping toward them with purpose.


  "The knowledge-thralls," Tomás whispered. "They''re awake. They sense intruders."


  Zara watched the black tide approach, understanding flooding through her. This wasn''t
  just a trap—it was a test. The Library was protecting itself, and she was meant
  to prove her worth. But proving worth meant drowning in living knowledge, losing
  herself to become worthy of its secrets.


  She had seconds to decide.


  "Tomás, run. Now."


  "What about you?"


  "The map stays with me. The cure stays with me. But..." She pulled out the stolen
  map, studying its cryptic symbols. "You were right about one thing. I move like
  shadow. But shadows aren''t just about hiding—they''re about knowing when to step
  into the light."


  She pressed the map into his hands. "Take this. Get out. Find someone else who can
  do what needs to be done."


  "You''ll die."


  "Maybe. But if I don''t face this, I fail everyone who needs that cure." She stepped
  toward the advancing ink. "Including your brother."


  The black tide reached her feet first. Cold flooded up her legs, then her chest.
  Zara felt her memories beginning to fray at the edges as knowledge not her own pressed
  against her mind. She was drowning in other people''s thoughts, other people''s
  lives.


  But something else happened. As her old self dissolved, she felt her thief''s instincts
  reshaping themselves. The darkness wasn''t consuming her—it was teaching her. Showing
  her how to see through other people''s lies, how to read the truth written in stone
  and shadow.


  When she finally pulled free from the pool, gasping and changed, Tomás was gone.
  The map was gone. But in their place was something new—an understanding of how the
  underground market really worked, how the Scorpion Guild operated, how to navigate
  the spaces between truth and deception.


  She was no longer just a thief. She was something more dangerous.


  Behind her, the chamber door sealed shut with a sound like breaking bones. Ahead,
  a new tunnel led deeper toward the Library. But as Zara began walking, she realized
  the true test wasn''t ahead—it was already over. The library had given her what
  she needed to reach it.


  The problem was, so had someone else.


  Scorpion Guild sentries stepped from the shadows ahead, weapons drawn, waiting.'
