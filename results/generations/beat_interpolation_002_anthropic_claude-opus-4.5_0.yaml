output: 'Sarah stared at the photograph until Amy''s face blurred behind her tears.
  Then she wiped her eyes and forced herself to think like a cop.


  Option one: recant. Take the stand Monday, claim she''d been mistaken about seeing
  Marchetti pull the trigger on Judge Harrison. Amy goes free. Marchetti goes free.
  The families of his seven confirmed victims get to watch their loved one''s killer
  walk out of court smiling.


  Her stomach turned. She set the option aside but couldn''t quite discard it.


  Option two: report the threat. Let the system work. FBI, task force, the whole apparatus
  of justice she''d devoted her career to—


  A knock at her door made her reach for her weapon. But it was only Marcus Webb,
  her partner of six years, holding two coffees and wearing his concerned face.


  "You look like hell, Chen. What''s wrong?"


  She showed him the photo. Watched his expression harden.


  "We take this to Morrison. Now. FBI has resources, hostage rescue teams—"


  "And how long does that take? Seventy-two hours, Marcus. By the time federal gets
  involved, coordinates with our people, navigates the jurisdictional nightmare—"
  She stopped, the real fear clawing up her throat. "Marchetti has people in the department.
  We both know it. The moment I report this officially, someone tips him off. Amy
  dies before the first warrant gets signed."


  Marcus was quiet. He couldn''t argue. They''d both seen leads evaporate, raids arrive
  at empty buildings, witnesses recant with bruises hidden beneath their collars.


  "So what? You just give up? Let him win?"


  Sarah looked at the photograph again. At her sister''s terrified eyes. At the industrial
  shelving visible behind her, the distinctive water stains on the concrete.


  She knew those stains. She''d processed a crime scene in a warehouse district three
  years ago, seen that exact pattern.


  "No," she said slowly. "I don''t let him win. But I can''t fight him as a cop."


  The idea took shape—terrible, necessary, clear.'
