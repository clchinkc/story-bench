output: "The hatch irised open and Jin floated into Mediation Hall Three, a cavern\
  \ whose walls were a patchwork of solar gauze and community murals. No uniforms,\
  \ no flags—just clusters of people drifting beneath a lattice of hydroponic vines.\
  \ Yet the atmosphere felt tighter than any boardroom on Earth. Hundreds of quiet\
  \ arguments braided through the air via whispered head-sets. Nothing here moved\
  \ without consensus, and consensus, he was learning, moved slowly.\n\nHe spent his\
  \ first three days confined to “quarantine orientation,” a euphemism for vetting.\
  \ Every meal token tallied, every sentence recorded. His request for a workspace\
  \ was bounced from Civic Resources to Habitat Health, then to something called the\
  \ Commons Catalytic Council. By the fourth rejection he understood the subtext:\
  \ being an enemy of Earth did not automatically make him a friend of the Collective.\
  \ Their life-support margins were razor thin; one saboteur could be fatal. So the\
  \ platform he’d imagined—an open channel to publish the stolen data—remained an\
  \ air-tight folder on his wrist slate.\n\nOn the fifth day he met Aisha Solanki,\
  \ a chemist old enough to have retired twice on Earth before defecting. She found\
  \ him in the communal algae garden, wrestling with the etiquette of harvesting protein\
  \ strands without cutting a quorum plant. \n\n“You trim too much,” she chided, guiding\
  \ his hand. “The root node serves six families.” Her tone softened. “First week\
  \ is always humiliating. Walk with me.”\n\nAs they glided along a spindle corridor,\
  \ Aisha explained the internal factions: Pragmatists who bartered patents for minerals,\
  \ Purists who demanded open science, and Balance-Keepers who policed atmospheric\
  \ equations the way Earth once policed borders. “Win one group,” she said, “you\
  \ antagonize the others. Remember that before you start waving revelations around.”\n\
  \nThat night, unable to sleep in the gentle rotation, Jin decrypted the deeper layers\
  \ of the leaked archive—files Yuna had hidden under misnamed spectrographs. There\
  \ were field notes from a final prototype run he’d never seen. The reactor scrubbed\
  \ a gigaton of CO₂ per month, just as advertised, but it released trace fluorocarbons\
  \ that bound to atmospheric water and, over years, could thin the ozone even faster\
  \ than carbon warming it hoped to undo. The council’s suppression wasn’t just greed;\
  \ it was half-truth environmental triage.\n\nHe closed the file, sickened. Publish\
  \ everything and Earth might swap one catastrophe for another. Bury it and the Council’s\
  \ chokehold endured. He drifted to the viewport where the blue sphere rotated beneath\
  \ him, storm bands glowing like bruises.\n\nAisha found him there. He confessed\
  \ the new data. “What happens if we install the reactors up here?” he asked.\n\n\
  “We suffocate,” she said simply. “Our CO₂ baseline is already too low. The Balance-Keepers\
  \ will fight you to the last breath.”\n\n“So both worlds are hostage to the same\
  \ physics.”\n\n“Or to partial information,” she corrected. “Truth can be lethal\
  \ if you don’t aim it.”\n\nThe next day, the Pragmatist faction offered him provisional\
  \ residency and a private lab—on condition he give them exclusive access to the\
  \ full dataset for six months. They would model revisions, filter the danger, then\
  \ decide what could be released. A closed door, but still a door.\n\nThe Purists\
  \ countered with an open mirror-cast this very cycle: broadcast the leak unredacted,\
  \ let every habitat and nation scramble at once. “Sunlight,” their envoy said, “is\
  \ the only disinfectant.”\n\nJin was marched from airlock to airlock, each faction\
  \ tugging at his conscience. Finally, in a tiny meditation pod peppered with condensation,\
  \ Aisha spoke again. “Compromise is oxygen here, Jin. Too little and we die of principle.”\n\
  \nHe remembered his parents’ orchard gone to dust, Yuna’s voice promising, “We’ll\
  \ wake them up.” What good was waking people just to leave them gasping?\n\nAt the\
  \ next assembly he took the mic, palms damp inside mag-gloves. “I accept the Pragmatists’\
  \ offer,” he announced, “on the condition that interim findings—stripped of reactive\
  \ compounds—are posted to the Collective’s open server weekly. After six months,\
  \ the full record is public, whatever it says.” \n\nA murmur rippled through the\
  \ hall—half outrage, half reluctant admiration. The motion passed by a narrow margin.\
  \ His slate chimed: residency granted, lab access code attached. Safety and a platform,\
  \ achieved.\n\nThat evening he floated alone in his assigned cubicle. The contract\
  \ icon glowed green, but another icon—Yuna’s hidden folder—blinked red, firewall-locked\
  \ by the agreement he had just signed. Six months of silence while glaciers calved\
  \ and cities sweltered. He had traded immediacy for feasibility, shouted truth for\
  \ engineered timing. \n\nJin exhaled, watching his breath frost the window. Below,\
  \ Earth continued to spin, oblivious to the bargain struck above its sky. He had\
  \ a lab key, a mentor, and a ticking clock. And he wondered, not for the first time,\
  \ whether exile was measured in distance or in the compromises we learn to live\
  \ with."
