output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her

  bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... different in a good way." Sophie let the words settle, then drew a slow
  breath. Her phone buzzed in her hand. She glanced at the screen: a stack of red
  badges; subject lines shouting. "Three emergencies while I was gone. Linda needs
  me to call her tonight."


  "Can''t it wait until morning?"


  Sophie tapped out a short reply to Linda: Just landed. I’ll review first thing and
  call you at 9. Then she slid the phone into her bag and switched it to Do Not Disturb.
  "Yes," she said, surprised at how easy the word felt. "It can."


  They drove in silence for a while. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through

  the evening haze. Sophie noticed the dusky light on the river, the tiny squares
  of office windows already glowing, the way her mother’s hands relaxed on the wheel
  when traffic opened up.


  "The Pearson account will still be there in the morning," she said, as much to herself
  as to her mother.


  Her apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought her morning latte. Everything
  exactly as she''d left it, and not the same at all.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, and this time it sounded less like surrender
  and more like arrival. She pressed her palm lightly against her chest, feeling the
  steady rhythm she’d practiced on thin cushions half a world away. The phone hummed
  again in her bag. She let it. The skyline slid past, and Sophie watched it, breathing,
  choosing what to answer now and what to answer when the sun came up.'
