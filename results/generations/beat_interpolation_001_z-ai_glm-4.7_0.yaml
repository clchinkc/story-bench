output: 'The morning sun did little to warm the chill in Elena’s bones. Shame had
  driven her back to her grandmother''s house at dawn to retrieve the glowing map
  she’d abandoned, and now she sought refuge in the one place that made sense of the
  nonsensical: Marcus’s curiosity shop.


  The bell above the door chimed, and Marcus looked up from a shelf of dusty jars.
  He looked less like a retired adventurer and more like a grandfather who mended
  toys, but Elena knew the jagged scar running down his forearm told a different story.


  "Running away or running toward?" he asked, his voice gravelly and kind.


  "Away from incompetence," Elena muttered, dropping the map onto his counter. "I
  can''t read the terrain, Marcus. I can read a card catalog, but that doesn''t help
  against monsters."


  Marcus chuckled, turning the map over in his calloused hands. "You’re looking at
  this wrong. You think adventure is about swordplay. It isn’t. It’s about research.
  It’s about finding the patterns others miss." He reached under the counter and pulled
  out a worn leather satchel and a heavy brass compass. "You know how to cross-reference,
  Elena. You know how to archive history. That is what this journey needs."


  He placed the items in her hands. "I can’t go with you—my knees are done for. But
  this compass points to intent, not north. Trust your training, not your fear."


  Elena looked down at the brass casing, feeling the weight of it. She wasn''t a warrior,
  but she was a researcher. "I guess," she whispered, a reluctant resolve hardening
  her voice, "I can always organize the chaos."


  "Exactly," Marcus smiled. "Now go."'
