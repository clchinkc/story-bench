output: 'The rain slicked the cracked pavement of Chicago’s South Side, turning the
  neon glow of Rosa’s old studio into a smeared halo. Dante Reyes stood under the
  flickering awning, his breath fogging the air as he lit a cigarette—three years
  clean, but the habit still clawed at him like a ghost. The door creaked open before
  he could knock, and a woman stepped out, her dark eyes scanning him with the wariness
  of a stray cat. "You’re the street artist," she said, voice low. "The one who sees
  colors."


  Dante exhaled smoke. "And you’re the one who doesn’t trust me yet."


  She crossed her arms. "That’s because I know what happens when Resonants get too
  close to the wrong people." Her name was Lila Voss, a former cop turned emotional
  tracker, her gift a razor-sharp sense of deception—she could taste lies like copper
  on her tongue. "Rosa warned me about you," Lila added, stepping closer. "Said you
  had a gift, but also a weakness."


  Dante’s fingers twitched toward the pocket where he kept his last pill bottle, now
  empty. "I’m clean."


  Lila didn’t flinch. "Clean doesn’t mean strong." She tossed him a key. "The Buckingham’s
  got a problem. Someone’s been draining Resonants dry, leaving them hollow. And the
  last victim? She saw something before she died." A pause. "Something about you."


  The key was cold in Dante’s palm. The Buckingham Hotel had been a graveyard of emotions
  for decades, its walls thick with the screams of the forgotten. But Rosa had always
  said it was safe—until now. Lila’s gaze locked onto his. "Prove you’re not the problem."


  The test was simple: follow the emotional trail of the killer. Dante closed his
  eyes, letting the city’s residue wash over him like ink in water. The colors were
  there—swirling black and crimson, thick as tar near the hotel’s back entrance. But
  when he reached out, the trail *moved*, slithering away like a wounded animal. His
  hands shook. "It’s not just a trail," he muttered. "It’s *hiding*."


  Lila’s jaw tightened. "Then we find it together." She pulled a silver flask from
  her coat. "Drink."


  The liquid burned like whiskey laced with lightning. Dante’s vision flared—suddenly,
  the colors *screamed*. The killer’s emotions weren’t just hidden; they were *masked*,
  woven into the hotel’s decay like a shroud. And at the center of it all, a face
  flickered in the residue: a girl with Dante’s eyes, her smile too bright, too *wrong*.


  Lila’s voice cut through the storm. "You recognize her?"


  Dante’s throat closed. "That’s not possible."


  But it was. His sister, Mia, her laughter twisted into something monstrous. The
  flask slipped from his fingers. "You’re saying the killer’s using her?"


  Lila’s expression darkened. "I’m saying you’re the only one who can see it. And
  if you can’t handle it—"


  "I’ll handle it." The words tasted like ash.


  The hotel’s lobby yawned ahead, its marble floors stained with centuries of sorrow.
  Dante stepped inside, the weight of Mia’s ghost pressing against his ribs. Lila
  followed, her hand on the knife at her belt. "Remember," she said, "the killer knows
  you’re coming."


  Dante didn’t answer. He was too busy watching the shadows stretch long and hungry,
  whispering his name.


  ---


  The plan was simple: find the killer before they struck again. But Dante’s hands
  kept drifting to the flask in his pocket, the one Lila had given him—a tool, not
  a crutch. "It’s not just about strength," she’d said. "It’s about *seeing*." And
  Dante was seeing things he wasn’t sure he could unsee.


  They’d spent the night in Rosa’s old studio, poring over maps of the hotel’s emotional
  hotspots, the places where the residue was thickest. Lila had brought a camera—an
  old Polaroid, its lens cracked. "The killer leaves traces," she explained. "Not
  just emotions. *Images*." She snapped a photo of the air near the lobby’s grand
  staircase, where the residue coiled like smoke. The developed picture showed a child’s
  handprint, glowing faintly blue.


  Dante’s stomach twisted. "Mia’s gift was light. She could make things *shine*."


  Lila didn’t look up. "And now someone’s using it."


  The hotel’s basement was a cavern of forgotten things—rusted pipes, peeling wallpaper,
  the air thick with the weight of drowned hopes. Dante’s fingers traced the damp
  stone, the colors bleeding into his skin like poison. "It’s down here," he said.
  "The killer’s hiding in the old boiler room."


  Lila’s grip tightened on her knife. "Then we go in together."


  Dante hesitated. The last time he’d faced his guilt, Mia had died. But this time,
  he wasn’t running. He was *seeing*. The flask in his pocket burned against his thigh.
  He took a deep breath and stepped forward, the darkness swallowing him whole.


  The boiler room was a nightmare of steam and shadows. The air hummed with stolen
  power, the residue swirling like a living thing. And at its center stood the killer—a
  figure draped in Mia’s old coat, her face obscured by a mask of cracked glass.


  "Dante Reyes," the voice was Mia’s, but wrong. "I’ve been waiting for you."


  Lila lunged, but the killer was faster, their hand flashing out. A searing pain
  lanced through Dante’s chest as the residue *ripped* from his skin, his vision swimming
  in black and red. He collapsed to his knees, the weight of his failure crushing
  him. *I couldn’t save her then. I can’t save anyone now.*


  The killer’s laughter echoed. "You were always too late."


  Lila’s blade glinted as she slashed at the figure, but the mask shattered, revealing
  not Mia’s face—but a stranger’s, twisted in grief. "You don’t understand," the killer
  gasped. "I just wanted to *feel* something. Anything."


  Dante’s breath came in ragged gasps. The flask. He fumbled for it, the liquid inside
  a storm of light and shadow. He hurled it at the killer’s feet.


  The explosion of color was blinding. The residue *screamed*, the stolen emotions
  tearing free like a living thing. The killer staggered, their form unraveling, the
  mask of glass shattering into a thousand pieces. "No—" they choked, collapsing as
  the weight of their own hollowed-out soul crushed them.


  Silence.


  Dante’s hands trembled, but the colors were fading, the pain receding. Lila knelt
  beside him, her voice steady. "You did it."


  He looked at his hands, no longer stained with black. Just skin. Just *him*. The
  guilt was still there, but it wasn’t a chain anymore. It was a memory.


  And for the first time in years, Dante Reyes let himself breathe.'
