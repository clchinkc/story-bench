output: 'The passage narrowed into a throat of stone, and they sprinted through suffocating
  darkness lit only by Tomás''s failing glow-stone. Behind them, torchlight flickered
  against the tunnel walls. Zara''s lungs burned. The Scorpion Guild was gaining.


  The passage opened onto a vast cavern. Tomás skidded to a halt at the edge of a
  bridge—a single span of weathered rope and rotting wood suspended above a chasm
  so deep the bottom disappeared into shadow.


  "The Approach," he breathed.


  The footsteps behind them grew louder. Voices shouted orders.


  "Go!" Tomás pushed her toward the bridge, but she saw the problem immediately. Halfway
  across, the rope was severed. Someone had done this deliberately—a trap, or a test.
  The bridge was impassable.


  Zara''s mind clicked into the old patterns. Thievery wasn''t just about stealing;
  it was about reading a space, understanding how people thought. She scanned the
  cavern walls and spotted what others would miss: iron pitons driven into the rock
  face years ago, worn but functional. A climbing route only visible if you knew to
  look for one.


  "There," she pointed. "We climb."


  But as the Guild members burst into the cavern, she realized Tomás couldn''t make
  the climb. His left leg was injured—she''d noticed his favoring it yesterday but
  he''d never mentioned it.


  She could climb alone. Should climb alone. He''d slow her down. The pitons might
  not hold both their weight.


  "Go," Tomás said, reading her hesitation. "Save yourself. Get to the Library."


  Zara thought of her mother, wasting away in the capital slums. Then she looked at
  Tomás''s face—lined with desperation and something else. Something that looked like
  penance.


  "Why are you really helping me?" she demanded, even as guards crossed the bridge
  carefully, testing its integrity.


  "Because I sent the expedition to the Library twenty years ago," Tomás said quietly.
  "Every scholar on it died. I told myself I was just a disgraced academic now, that
  it was done. But when you came to the market asking about passages, I saw a chance
  to fix what I''d broken. To help someone actually survive where my arrogance got
  others killed."


  Zara grabbed his arm. "Then we both climb."


  They moved together, Zara leading, anchoring herself on each piton and helping Tomás
  up. Their pursuers hesitated, calculating whether the climb was worth it. By the
  time the first Guild member began following, Zara and Tomás were already halfway
  up the cavern face.


  The rock was ancient and crumbling. Halfway to the top, a piton gave way beneath
  Tomás. He gasped, slipping. Zara caught him, her hands seized by a terror sharper
  than any blade—not of falling, but of failing. Of coming this far only to lose everything.
  Of carrying another death.


  She pulled him upward through that fear, feeling it transform into something harder,
  clearer. Not fearlessness but focus. One movement. The next. Each piton a choice,
  each breath a small victory.


  They pulled themselves over the lip of the cavern into a narrow opening. Behind
  them, voices faded as the climbing proved too difficult for the Guild to pursue.


  Zara collapsed, gasping, reborn from the descent into herself. She was no longer
  the frightened thief running from danger. She''d crossed something deeper than any
  bridge—a line between who she''d been and who she was becoming. Someone capable
  of choosing others over safety. Someone who could endure.


  But as their breathing slowed, Tomás pointed deeper into the tunnel ahead.


  "There''s another problem," he whispered. "The Library isn''t empty. The last expedition
  didn''t die from collapse." He met her eyes. "They were killed by whoever guards
  that place. We just entered their territory."'
