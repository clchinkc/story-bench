output: 'Sarah spent the first twelve hours examining every angle, the way she''d
  been trained. The photograph lay on her kitchen table between her service weapon
  and her phone, a triangle of impossible choices.


  Recanting would be simple. She''d seen it before—witnesses who suddenly "misremembered"
  details. A judge would be irritated but unsurprised. Marchetti would walk. Amy would
  live. And Sarah would spend the rest of her life watching a murderer run free, knowing
  she''d broken the one thing that mattered: her oath.


  She deleted the thought and reached for her phone.


  Marcus Webb arrived within twenty minutes, his perpetual five o''clock shadow darker
  than usual. Her partner of six years didn''t ask questions until he''d seen the
  photograph.


  "We go straight to Morrison," Marcus said immediately. "Full protective detail on
  Amy. FBI involvement. Organized crime task force. We have protocols for exactly
  this situation."


  "Protocols." Sarah heard the hollowness in her own voice. "The same protocols that
  somehow didn''t prevent the Marchetti family from knowing my sister''s current address?
  From getting past building security? From intercepting witness locations in three
  previous cases?"


  Marcus''s jaw tightened. "You think there''s a leak."


  "I think the Marchettis have been two steps ahead of us for eighteen months. I think
  every official channel we use is a channel they can monitor." She stared at the
  photo. "Going through proper channels means trusting a system that''s already compromised."


  "So what''s the alternative? Going rogue? Sarah, you can''t—"


  "I can''t testify if Amy''s dead. I can''t recant if I want to live with myself.
  And I can''t trust the department to keep her safe when someone in that building
  is feeding information to the family." The words crystallized something she''d been
  circling all day. "There is no good option here, Marcus. Only impossible ones."


  He left after midnight, promising to "work something out through official channels,"
  but they both knew the truth.


  Sarah sat alone in the dark, her sister''s face staring up at her, and began planning
  her exit strategy. Not from the situation.


  From the department.'
