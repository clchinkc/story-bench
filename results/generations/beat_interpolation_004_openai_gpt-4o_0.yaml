output: 'Thomas approached the witness stand, his mind a whirl of strategy and desperation.
  Dr. Okonkwo''s eyes flickered with a mix of resolve and fear, and he knew the moment
  was precarious. He steadied himself, aware that every word now carried the weight
  of seventeen lost lives and the promise of justice.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," he began, his voice even but firm, "can you confirm your position
  at Meridian Pharmaceuticals during the period in question?"


  She hesitated, her gaze darting briefly to the defense table, where the CEO leaned
  back, exuding smug confidence. "I was head of research," she replied, her voice
  barely above a whisper.


  "And in that role," Thomas continued, "did you oversee the clinical trials for the
  drug known as Zynthera?"


  Dr. Okonkwo nodded slowly, but her eyes betrayed a storm of conflict. "Yes, I did."


  A murmur rippled through the courtroom. Thomas felt the tension ratchet higher,
  the moment of decision drawing near. "And during these trials, were adverse reactions
  documented?"


  "Yes," she said, her voice faltering. "There were... adverse reactions."


  Thomas knew she was dangerously close to recanting. He had to act. "Dr. Okonkwo,
  you have the power to make a difference today. Not just for those who have suffered,
  but for your daughter. Tell us, why were these adverse reactions not reported to
  the FDA?"


  She looked down, her hands trembling. "I... I was under pressure," she confessed,
  her voice cracking. "We were told to suppress the data."


  The defense lawyer shot to his feet. "Objection, Your Honor—"


  "Overruled," Judge Mendez said, his tone sharp. "Continue, Mr. Wright."


  Thomas leaned in, his eyes steady on hers. "Dr. Okonkwo, the truth can set you free.
  For your daughter, for those who deserve justice. What was the company''s directive
  regarding the reports?"


  Her eyes met his, and for a moment, everything hung in the balance. Then, in one
  deep breath, she committed. "We were instructed to falsify the reports," she admitted,
  her voice gaining strength. "To hide the fatalities."


  The courtroom erupted in gasps. The defense team scrambled, but the damage was done.
  The truth had broken through. Thomas exhaled, his heart pounding with relief and
  grief. The trial would turn on her words, the truth undeniable now.


  Dr. Okonkwo''s testimony had shifted the balance irrevocably, and Thomas knew the
  hardest part was over. The path to justice was clear, and as he stepped back, he
  saw a glimmer of resolve in her eyes—an understanding that sometimes, courage was
  the only choice one could live with.'
