  *Abfahrt: 16 Uhr*. Amara kept her eyes downcast as she passed, but the words burned
  in her mind. Sixteen hundred—the hour when the coastal patrol changed shifts at
  the Elmina road checkpoint. She had thirty minutes.


  Behind the palm grove where night soil was buried, Amara knelt and dug a shallow
  hole. Her servant''s identification—the paper that marked her as property of the
  Whitmore household, that allowed her to move through Cape Coast unmolested—she placed
  it in the earth and covered it with her bare hands. The ink of her bondage dissolved
  into African soil.


  There could be no return now.


  She reached the checkpoint as shadows lengthened. Two British soldiers argued over
  a card game while their relief approached from the garrison. In the gap between
  duty and distraction, Amara slipped into the bush road heading north.


  Her father had taught her that knowledge was the only weapon the colonizers could
  not confiscate. She had believed him then as a child memorizing vocabulary by candlelight.
  She believed him differently now, her scholar''s mind calculating distances and
  dangers, the intercepted letter pressed flat against her ribs beneath her cloth.
  She was no longer a servant who happened to read. She was a woman who had chosen
  what her reading would mean.


  The forest swallowed the sounds of the coast.

  Three days north of Cape Coast, the palm wine tapper found her before she found
  him.


  "You walk like someone who has never walked far," he said in Fante, emerging from
  the undergrowth with a machete that could harvest or kill. "But you look like someone
  who needs to."


  Amara''s hand drifted toward the small knife at her waist. "I carry a message."


  "Many people carry messages. Some carry them to the wrong ears." He switched to
  Twi, testing. "Who taught you the bush roads?"


  "No one. I am teaching myself."


  He laughed without warmth. "A woman alone, teaching herself the roads the British
  are hunting. Tell me why I shouldn''t think you''re bait."


  From his pouch, he produced a crumpled paper—German text, military shorthand. "This
  was taken from a dead messenger. If you are what you claim, read it."


  The words came slowly—*Verstärkung... Ashanti-Grenze... sieben Tage*—but their meaning
  struck like a blow. "Reinforcements," Amara breathed. "To the Ashanti border. Seven
  days."


  The tapper''s expression shifted. "The network is not just in the cities, scholar''s
  daughter. We are the roots beneath the roads." He pointed north. "Two more days.
  But the British have dogs on the trail now. They know something is moving."


  Amara had thought herself the only one. She had been wrong. The knowing changed
  something in her spine, straightened it.


  ---


  On the fifth day, she heard the dogs.


  The resistance stronghold lay beyond the river, beyond the German missionary station
  whose whitewashed walls gleamed through the trees. Amara crouched in the undergrowth,
  her body screaming with exhaustion, and listened.


  Two voices carried through the humid air. German. *"Die Britin zahlen gut für Informationen.
  Das Mädchen—"* The British are paying well for information. The girl—


  They knew. The missionaries had seen her, or heard of her. The pursuit was not behind
  her now; it surrounded her.


  To survive, she could turn back. Find another route. Wait for darkness, for safety,
  for someone else to carry the warning.


  But seven days. Reinforcements in seven days, and her father''s name on an execution
  list.


  Resistance was not survival. Resistance was choosing what mattered more than surviving.


  Amara circled wide, using the German voices as a map of where not to go. The letter
  against her ribs had worn a raw patch on her skin. She welcomed the pain. It reminded
  her that the words she carried—the words she could read, could understand, could
  weaponize—were more than paper.


  When she forded the river and saw the first sentry raise his rifle, she did not
  raise her hands in surrender. She raised her voice.


  "I am Amara Osei," she said, "and I bring fire."'
