output: 'The ink on the stolen letter had barely dried when Amara Osei knew she could
  not stay. The words burned in her mind—*arrest, execution, by dawn*—her father’s
  name scrawled in the British officer’s precise hand. She had memorized the route
  to the resistance stronghold in the Ashanti forest months ago, tracing it on stolen
  maps by candlelight, but the thought of leaving Cape Coast had always been abstract,
  a scholar’s fantasy. Now, the weight of the letter in her pocket was real. The risk
  was real.


  She moved through the colonial quarter like a shadow, her servant’s uniform—starched
  white cotton, the hem still damp from the morning’s laundry—her only armor. The
  market square teemed with soldiers, their red coats bright against the dust. Amara
  kept her eyes down, her basket of yams slung low over her arm, but her fingers twitched
  toward the knife hidden in her sleeve. *Not yet.* The British had eyes everywhere,
  and a woman alone on the road would be noticed. She needed a distraction.


  Near the wharf, a group of Ashanti traders argued with a customs officer over a
  shipment of kola nuts. The officer’s back was turned. Amara slipped into the alley
  behind the trading post, where the stench of rotting fish masked her presence. She
  stripped off her servant’s dress, revealing the rough-spun tunic and trousers beneath—clothes
  she’d stolen from the laundry of a Fante trader. Her hair, usually bound in a tight
  knot, she loosened just enough to obscure her face. A man’s hat, stolen weeks ago
  and hidden in the rafters of her father’s hut, completed the disguise. She tucked
  the letter into the lining of her hat and stepped back into the street.


  The first test came at the city gates. A young soldier, no older than she was, blocked
  her path. “Where you headed, boy?” His accent was thick, his rifle slung carelessly
  over his shoulder.


  Amara forced her voice lower, rougher. “My uncle’s farm. Beyond the creek.” She
  gestured vaguely toward the forest, her pulse hammering. The soldier eyed her, then
  the basket of yams—her alibi. “You got papers?”


  *Papers.* Of course. She swallowed. “Burned in the last raid. Bandits, sir.” She
  let her voice waver, just enough. The soldier hesitated, then waved her through.
  “Don’t dawdle. Curfew’s at dusk.”


  She didn’t look back.


  The road beyond Cape Coast was a wound through the earth, rutted and uneven. The
  forest loomed ahead, dense and whispering. Amara had never been this far from the
  city. The air smelled different—thicker, alive with the scent of damp soil and wild
  herbs. She walked until her legs ached, until the sun bled into the treetops. Then,
  from the undergrowth, a voice:


  “You’re not a farmer.”


  Amara froze. A woman stepped onto the path, her face lined with years, her eyes
  sharp as flint. She wore a resistance sash—red and black, the colors of the Asantehene’s
  flag. Amara’s breath caught. “I—”


  “You’re the scholar’s daughter.” The woman’s gaze flicked to Amara’s hands, still
  smooth despite the dirt. “The one who reads the white man’s letters.”


  Amara’s fingers curled into fists. “How do you know that?”


  The woman smirked. “Because I’m the one who taught your father to write in the first
  place.” She extended a hand. “Kofiwa. And you’re either very brave or very foolish
  to be out here alone.”


  Amara hesitated. “Both, maybe.”


  Kofiwa’s laugh was dry. “Good. Fools and the brave are the only ones who survive
  this war.” She turned, beckoning. “Come. The British patrol this road at night.
  We move fast, or we don’t move at all.”


  Amara followed, her heart pounding. The forest swallowed them whole.

  The test came at the river crossing.


  Kofiwa had warned her: *The water is shallow, but the currents are treacherous.
  And the British have scouts on the far bank.* Amara had nodded, but she hadn’t understood—not
  until she saw the man waiting on the opposite shore.


  He was British, his uniform dark with sweat, his rifle gleaming. He hadn’t seen
  them yet, but he would. The river was narrow here, the water clear as glass.


  Kofiwa crouched beside her. “We can’t fight him. Not here.”


  Amara’s mind raced. The letter in her hat was her only proof, her only weapon. But
  if she used it—if she revealed herself—she’d be exposing the resistance’s secrets.
  She thought of the German officer who’d once praised her fluency, the way his guard
  had dropped when she spoke his language. *Knowledge is resistance.*


  She stood, waving her arms. “Hallo!” she called in German, her voice bright, desperate.
  “Hilfe! Bitte!”


  The soldier turned, frowning. “Wer—?”


  Amara didn’t let him finish. She waded into the river, her trousers clinging to
  her legs, her hat—with the letter—clutched in her hand. “Mein Bruder,” she gasped,
  switching to English. “He’s hurt. On the other side. Please, you must help!”


  The soldier hesitated, then waded toward her. “Where?”


  Amara pointed downstream, her voice trembling. “There! Hurry!”


  As he passed her, she lunged, driving her knife into the soft flesh beneath his
  ribs. He gasped, his eyes wide with shock. She caught him as he fell, lowering him
  into the water. The current took him.


  Kofiwa was at her side in an instant. “You speak German?”


  Amara wiped the knife on her trousers, her hands steady. “I speak whatever I need
  to.”


  Kofiwa’s expression shifted—something like respect flickering in her eyes. “Then
  you’re one of us now.”

  The stronghold was closer than Amara had imagined. The forest thinned, revealing
  a clearing where the earth had been carved into terraces, hidden beneath the canopy.
  Huts of woven palm fronds blended into the trees, and the air hummed with the low
  murmur of voices. Resistance fighters moved like shadows, their faces painted with
  the marks of the Asante.


  Amara’s breath caught. She had spent her life in the colonial quarter, listening,
  watching, but this—this was the heart of the fight. And she was about to step into
  it.


  Kofiwa stopped at the edge of the clearing. “You understand what this means? Once
  you cross this line, there’s no going back.”


  Amara thought of the letter in her hat, of her father’s name scrawled in ink. She
  thought of the soldier in the river, of the way his life had slipped away so easily.
  She had spent years hiding, years pretending. But now, she was here. And she was
  done pretending.


  She adjusted her hat, her fingers brushing the letter. “I know.”


  Kofiwa nodded. “Then welcome to the war, scholar.”


  Amara stepped forward.


  The first arrow struck the tree beside her head before she heard the twang of the
  bow. She dropped to the ground, her heart in her throat. Kofiwa cursed, dragging
  her behind a fallen log. “Patrol,” she hissed. “They must’ve followed us.”


  Amara’s mind raced. The British were here. They knew. She thought of the German
  soldier, of the way his guard had dropped when she spoke his language. *Knowledge
  is resistance.*


  She turned to Kofiwa. “I need a distraction. Something loud.”


  Kofiwa’s eyes narrowed. “What are you—?”


  Amara didn’t wait for an answer. She pulled the letter from her hat, her fingers
  trembling. She had memorized every word, every name. She knew what the British feared
  most.


  She stood, her voice ringing through the clearing. “Listen to me!” she shouted in
  Twi, then in English, then in German. “The British are coming! They know where you
  are! They have names—your names!”


  The resistance fighters froze. A man stepped forward, his face a mask of fury. “Who
  are you?”


  Amara met his gaze. “I’m the one who brought you the warning. And I’m the one who’s
  going to make sure they don’t take another step.”


  She turned to the trees, her voice rising. “You want us?” she called in English.
  “Come and get us!”


  The forest erupted in gunfire. Amara dropped beside Kofiwa, her heart pounding.
  The resistance fighters moved like a storm, their arrows and rifles answering the
  British volley.


  Kofiwa grabbed her arm. “You’re either the bravest woman I’ve ever met or the stupidest.”


  Amara smiled, her hands steady. “Both, maybe.”


  And then she ran into the fight.'
