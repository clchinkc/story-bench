output: 'The Buckingham''s basement reeked of mildew and something sharper—fear, maybe,
  or desperation. Dante could see it clinging to the walls, a sickly yellow-green
  that pulsed like infection. The other Resonants had scattered after Rosa''s body
  was found, but someone had left a message: *Meet me where the rats dance*.


  She was waiting in the furnace room, a woman maybe forty with silver threading her
  black hair and eyes that catalogued him like evidence. "Dante Reyes." Not a question.


  "You knew Rosa?"


  "Everyone knew Rosa. Not everyone knows why her star pupil vanished for two years
  chasing oblivion in a needle." The emotional residue around her flickered crimson—anger,
  but underneath, something sadder. Grief.


  Dante''s hand went unconsciously to his pocket, where his three-year NA chip rested
  like a talisman. "I got clean."


  "Congratulations. Want a medal or just my trust?" She stepped closer. "I''m Elise.
  And before I tell you what I know about Rosa''s killer, you''re going to prove you''re
  not the rat."


  "The rat?"


  "Someone''s been feeding the killer locations, identities. How else would he know
  where to find us?" Her residue flared brighter. "Rosa trusted you. Show me why."


  The test came fast. Elise produced a photograph—a crime scene, the killer''s third
  victim. "Read it. Tell me what happened."


  Dante took the photo, and the residue exploded across his vision. Terror in arterial
  red. Betrayal in muddy brown. And something else, a crystalline blue he''d only
  seen once before—the same shade that had clung to his sister''s apartment the day
  she died. His hands shook.


  "Two minutes before death, someone he knew arrived," Dante forced out. "Someone
  he felt safe with. The blue—it''s trust turning to shock. He recognized his killer."


  Elise''s expression cracked open. "The police said the door wasn''t forced. But
  they thought—" She stopped. "There''s more. Look closer at the edges."


  Dante squinted, fighting the nausea the residue always brought. There, nearly invisible,
  a thread of silver-white. "Someone else was there. Watching, not participating,
  but... feeding information?"


  "The rat has a distinctive signature. I''ve been tracking it for weeks." Elise pulled
  out her phone, showed him a map pinpointed with locations. "Every murder site has
  that same silver-white thread. And it showed up at the Buckingham yesterday—right
  before you arrived."


  The implication hung between them like smoke. But Dante was already moving, pulling
  out his NA chip, pressing it between his palms until his own emotional residue—three
  years of meetings, prayers, desperate mornings—bled into it. He held it out.


  "This is every day I chose to stay alive after my sister died. Every time I wanted
  to use and didn''t. Read *me*, Elise. If I were the rat, could I fake this?"


  She took the chip, closed her eyes. When she opened them, they were wet. "Rosa said
  you were her best student. I see why." She pocketed the chip carefully. "There''s
  a Resonant named Marcus Chen who knew all the victims. Silver-white signature. He''s
  been at the Buckingham every night this week."

  They planned in Elise''s apartment above a Korean restaurant, the air thick with
  kimchi and cordite tension. Elise spread blueprints of the Buckingham across her
  table—the real blueprints, showing the hidden sub-basement where Resonants had been
  gathering for decades.


  "The killer''s using the accumulated emotional energy as a battery," Elise explained.
  "Each murder makes him stronger. If he''s working with Marcus, they''ll strike during
  the new moon gathering tomorrow night. Maximum Resonants in one place."


  Dante traced the path to the sub-basement, but his finger kept stopping at a specific
  chamber. "This room. Rosa took me here once. Said it was where the saddest residue
  collected—from suicides, overdoses, last moments."


  "The Heart Chamber. Everything flows there eventually." Elise paused. "Dante, if
  you go in there, you''ll face every piece of guilt you''re carrying. Your sister.
  Rosa. Every person you couldn''t save."


  "I know." He''d been dreading this since he found Rosa''s body, knowing the path
  would lead here. In the photo of the third victim, he''d recognized that crystalline
  blue not just from his sister''s apartment but from his own emotional residue—the
  specific shade of guilt at failing someone you loved.


  "We could find another way," Elise offered, but her tone said otherwise.


  Dante picked up his NA chip from where she''d returned it to the table. Three years
  seemed simultaneously eternal and desperately fragile. "My sponsor always said recovery
  means walking toward the pain, not around it. I''ve been running from my sister''s
  death long enough."


  They gathered what they needed: iron filings to disrupt emotional residue, mirrors
  to reflect psychic attacks, and a recording of Rosa''s voice—her last message to
  Dante, kept on his phone, never listened to. At midnight, they stood before the
  Buckingham''s broken entrance, its doors gaping like a mouth.


  "Once we cross this threshold," Elise said, "the residue in there will know we''re
  coming. No element of surprise."


  Dante thought of Rosa, of his sister, of all the Resonants who''d died hollow. He
  stepped through.


  ---


  The Heart Chamber pulsed with accumulated anguish, decades of despair crystallized
  into stalactites of frozen emotion. Marcus Chen stood at its center, but the man
  beside him made Dante''s breath stop. Older, graying, but unmistakable—the dealer
  who''d sold his sister her last hit.


  "Hello, Dante," the killer said. "I''ve been using your sister''s death residue
  to track Resonants like you for three years. Did you know guilt has a frequency?
  You''ve been a beacon."


  The chamber erupted. Emotional residue—his sister''s terror, Rosa''s betrayal, every
  victim''s final moments—crashed over Dante like a tsunami. He couldn''t breathe,
  couldn''t see, drowning in crystalline blue guilt that tasted like pills and funeral
  flowers.


  Elise was fighting Marcus, but Dante was on his knees, the killer''s power pulling
  every molecule of remorse from his marrow. He was dying, not physically, but worse—feeling
  everything he''d suppressed for three years in one annihilating instant.


  His hand found the NA chip in his pocket.


  Three years. Sixty meetings. A thousand small choices to breathe through pain instead
  of swallowing it.


  "I couldn''t save her," Dante whispered, and the admission cracked something open.
  Not breaking, but opening. "I couldn''t save Rosa either. I can''t save everyone."


  The crystalline blue guilt began to shift, darkening to sapphire—not disappearing,
  but integrating. He stood, vision clearing, and saw what the killer couldn''t: his
  own residue was borrowed, stolen, parasitic. Dante''s guilt was earned, genuine,
  transformed through acceptance into something that looked like grief but felt like
  love.


  "You feed on our guilt," Dante said, pulling the killer''s stolen power back through
  invisible threads, "but you don''t understand it. Guilt means we cared. That you
  can''t take."


  He channeled three years of recovery—every morning he chose life—through his NA
  chip, letting its accumulated resilience flow into the chamber''s residue. The killer''s
  stolen power couldn''t digest it, couldn''t metabolize hope that had survived despair.


  The man collapsed, hollowed by his own weapon turned inward.


  Dante caught Elise as she fell, Marcus unconscious beside her. In the Heart Chamber''s
  sudden quiet, the blue residue of his guilt remained—but now it held his sister
  gently, like memory instead of wound.'
