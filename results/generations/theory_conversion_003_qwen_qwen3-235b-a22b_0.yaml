output: "Kenji Nakamura’s reflection in the rain-streaked window fractured the skyline\
  \ into jagged shards. At 52, his Tokyo corner office—a glass-and-steel mausoleum—was\
  \ now stripped bare, save for a cardboard box containing his nameplate. “Sometimes\
  \ losing everything is how we find what matters,” his secretary murmured, handing\
  \ him the box. He’d traded two decades building an empire for an empty apartment\
  \ and birthday cards from a daughter with no return address.  \n\nThe letter arrived\
  \ on rice paper, Yuki’s handwriting softer than he remembered. Her mother’s death\
  \ had left a hollow where his absence once lived. “I don’t want to do this alone,”\
  \ she’d written. Kyoto. A wedding. A chance to be someone’s father again. Yet his\
  \ suit still smelled of boardrooms, and the thought of leaving Tokyo felt like surrender.\
  \ He packed his laptop.  \n\nAct I: The shinkansen’s hum blurred into sleep. When\
  \ Kenji stumbled off in Kyoto, the village clung to autumn—maple leaves and mist,\
  \ not spreadsheets. Yuki met him with a bow, formal as a stranger. Her fiancé’s\
  \ family treated him like a ghost. That night, he wandered to Haruki’s workshop,\
  \ where bamboo whistles hissed under the craftsman’s knife. “Impatience bends the\
  \ wrong way,” Haruki warned, handing him splintered reeds. Kenji’s first attempt\
  \ snapped.  \n\nAct II: The village measured time in seasons, not quarterly reports.\
  \ Kenji stumbled through wedding preparations—tying too-tight knots for ceremonial\
  \ garlands, burning incense too hastily. Haruki taught him to weave baskets, each\
  \ strip a lesson in pressure and patience. “Bamboo survives the storm by yielding,”\
  \ the old man said. Yuki softened, laughing when he botched a tea ceremony. At the\
  \ harvest festival, she introduced him as “my father” to her fiancé’s clan. Pride\
  \ swelled in Kenji’s chest. He’d misunderstood the invitation: he wasn’t here to\
  \ fix things. He was here to stay.  \n\nThe first complication arrived via email—a\
  \ consortium offered to fund his return to corporate life, using the wedding connections.\
  \ “A phoenix needs only one spark,” the message read. Kenji deleted it. But when\
  \ Yuki overheard him on a call with investors, her face froze. “You networked your\
  \ way here.” Her voice cracked. “Just like always.” The wedding invitation crinkled\
  \ in his fist.  \n\nAct III: Rain lashed the eaves as Kenji sat alone in the inn,\
  \ Haruki’s unfinished basket on the table. “You’re still choosing ambition,” Yuki\
  \ had said. His daughter’s eyes, identical to her mother’s, haunted him. At dawn,\
  \ he called the consortium. “I’m not interested.” The line hissed static, then silence.\
  \  \n\nHe found Yuki at the shrine, adjusting lanterns. “I came to ask for forgiveness,”\
  \ he said, not touching her shoulder. “Not to earn it.” She didn’t look at him,\
  \ but her hands slowed. When she left, the lanterns glowed steady.  \n\nThe wedding\
  \ was white and gold beneath ginkgo trees. Kenji waited at the gate, watching through\
  \ a crack in the door. His daughter’s laughter, rich as matcha, carried on the wind.\
  \ Afterward, she approached, her veil gone. “You stayed.” “I should’ve stayed years\
  \ ago.” Her fingers brushed his—brief, uncertain.  \n\nBack in Tokyo, Kenji’s apartment\
  \ breathed. Pothos vines curled across Haruki’s bamboo planters; Yuki’s wedding\
  \ photo stood beside his keys. The shop downstairs—*Takeuchi Bamboo*, named for\
  \ his wife—smelled of lacquer and possibility. He left the sign open.  \n\n(Word\
