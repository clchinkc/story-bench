output: 'Zoe Chen lived in the quiet. At seventeen, her summers were measured in the
  soft thump of books being shelved at the Millbrook Public Library. Here, among the
  stacks, she could disappear into other people’s stories, which was safer than having
  one of her own. The predictability was a blanket. Yet, in the silent spaces between
  chapters, a loneliness hummed—a sense that she was a spectator in her own life.


  The need was simple, and terrifying: to connect.


  When the new librarian, Ms. Okafor, announced the oral history project, Zoe’s stomach
  tightened. “Their stories deserve to be preserved,” Ms. Okafor said. Talking to
  strangers? Zoe’s hand stayed firmly down. But days later, Ms. Okafor found her,
  pressed a recorder into her palm, and said, “Just one interview. Try.” The gentle
  push was enough. Zoe, heart pounding, crossed into the unfamiliar.


  She entered the searching phase clumsily. Her first interview with Bernard Park,
  an eighty-nine-year-old Korean War veteran, was a stilted exchange, her questions
  trembling on index cards. The second was worse. She fumbled with the recorder, her
  voice a timid whisper. Her mother thought it a waste of a summer, a distraction
  from a “real” job. But Zoe persisted, driven by a growing sense that something important
  was hiding in these pauses, in these weathered voices. She began to learn that listening
  wasn’t passive; it was an act of excavation.


  Then, she found it. During their fifth conversation, Bernard leaned forward. “You’re
  the first person who ever asked the right questions,” he said. He revealed he’d
  never spoken of what truly happened in Korea—the guilt, the grace. He wanted to
  tell her, but only if she would share it publicly. In that moment, Zoe understood
  the need she’d been feeling all along: it was for this. Not just to hear, but to
  hold a truth for someone else. Listening was the courage she’d been searching for.


  She had to take the price of the understanding. The town hall was packed. A hundred
  faces watched as she stepped to the microphone, her old anxiety screaming. But she
  pressed play on Bernard’s recording, and then, when the time came, she gave voice
  to his story herself. She spoke of his survival, his silence, his trust. Her voice,
  once meant only for the stacks, now filled the room, carrying his truth.


  She returned to the library. The program ended; the other volunteers moved on. Autumn
  leaves replaced summer sun. She kept visiting Bernard, but in October, he passed
  away. The quiet of the library felt different now—not an escape, but a repository.
  His family asked her to speak at his funeral. This time, the story she told was
  their story, of what he had taught her.


  The change was in her hands, tangible. Senior year, Zoe filled out applications
  for journalism programs. Her essay was not about herself, but about Millbrook’s
  forgotten voices, about Bernard, about the space between a question and an answer
  where connection is born. She still rehearsed her coffee order under her breath.
  But she knew, now, that she could stand before a hundred strangers and make them
  lean in to listen.'
