output: 'Yuki moved through the crew quarters, scanning empty bunks and open lockers.
  The air was stale but breathable, the temperature steady. Her tablet showed no biosignatures,
  no movement, yet the rooms felt recently vacated: a half-folded uniform on a chair,
  a datapad still warm, coffee rings on a desk. She checked the mess hall next. Trays
  stacked, steam still rising from a forgotten bowl. The station hummed, functional
  and indifferent, while forty-seven people had simply vanished.


  She pulled up the manifest and cross-referenced with the medical bay logs. Three
  days ago, the crew had logged a breakthrough in the Kronin protocol. The file was
  encrypted, but her clearance was high enough. The data spoke of dimensional phase-locking,
  of volunteers accepting a transitional state while their bodies recalibrated. The
  language was clinical, but the subtext was clear: they had volunteered for something
  dangerous and irreversible.


  A low-frequency thrum vibrated through the deck plates. Her scanner spiked, registering
  a spatial distortion that didn’t appear on any schematic. She followed the reading
  toward Lab Seven, past the hydroponics and the engineering annex. The corridor narrowed,
  emergency lights flickering in a rhythmic pulse.


  She reached the lab’s outer door. The bulkhead was sealed, and the control panel
  showed a hard lock. Behind the glass, the room was intact, instruments untouched.
  In the center, a containment field shimmered, casting prismatic reflections across
  the walls. She could see the outline of a data core, but it was inaccessible without
  a proper shutdown sequence.


  Yuki’s hands flew over the panel, toggling power relays and resetting the interface.
  The lock refused to yield. She rerouted from an auxiliary conduit, bypassing the
  primary circuit, sweat beading on her forehead. The hum grew louder, and the air
  seemed to thicken. A pressure shift tugged at her eardrums, as if the station itself
  had inhaled.


  She felt them before she saw them. A movement at the edge of her vision, a whisper
  that might have been wind. The lights strobed, and the air rippled. Figures flickered
  into view, translucent and indistinct, hovering at the threshold of visibility.
  They didn’t speak, but their presence pressed against her, a cold current that made
  her teeth ache and her breath come short.


  Yuki forced herself to breathe, focusing on the task. She ran a phase variance scan,
  mapping the distortions. The readings matched the medical logs: a localized dimensional
  shear, sustained by the containment field. The crew hadn’t abandoned the station;
  they had been altered by their own experiment. The transformed figures pressed closer,
  their forms wavering like heat haze, and Yuki felt a spike of fear. She wasn’t sure
  if they meant harm, but she couldn’t stop.


  She found the shutdown code embedded in the lab’s secondary system, a safeguard
  Reyes had left for emergencies. Yuki entered it, and the containment field flickered,
  then collapsed. The air cracked, and the figures surged. A cold draft rushed past
  her, and she stumbled, catching herself against the panel. The door cycled open
  with a sigh.


  She stood in the doorway, scanner in hand, heart hammering. The core sat in the
  center of the room, intact and glowing. She had found exactly what she had come
  for. She just didn’t yet understand the cost.'
