output: 'The crisis hit at dinner. A plate of brill in saffron sauce, the fish Maya
  had chosen for its sweetness, returned untouched. Alejandro stared at the window,
  not the food, his jaw tight like a goalkeeper reading a free kick.


  "You''re not eating," she said quietly, standing at the edge of the dining room.


  He didn''t look at her. "I''m not hungry."


  She had learned his patterns by then: the way he circled the table before sitting,
  the precise angle of his fork, the way he tasted air more than food. She''d watched
  him push rice around his plate and pretend to sip wine he didn''t swallow. She''d
  heard Lucia mention the doctors years ago, the concussion that dulled flavor, the
  silence that followed. It was not her business. She cooked, he ate or didn''t. That
  was the contract.


  Tonight, his stillness felt different. She crossed to him, close enough to see the
  faint silver line along his hairline, a souvenir from a tackle in a match that had
  ended a career.


  "Alejandro." She waited until he finally met her eyes. "Tell me what you can taste."


  Something flickered in his face, a muscle in his jaw. "Salt," he said after a long
  pause. "Sometimes metal. That''s it."


  She nodded once and went back to the kitchen. She didn''t turn on the music. She
  didn''t call for help. She peeled onions until her eyes watered and she could smell
  nothing but their sharp, honest sting. She chopped carrots with the steady rhythm
  she used when her hands were too full of fear to think. She added stock—chicken,
  not fish—brought it to a simmer, and let the house fill with the only thing that
  had never failed her: the quiet competence of a pot doing its job.


  She carried the bowl to the dining room. Clear broth, a few drops of olive oil,
  a handful of chopped parsley. She set it in front of him and sat down across.


  "It''s not a test," she said. "It''s just soup."


  He lifted the spoon. His hand shook, almost imperceptibly. He tasted and closed
  his eyes. When he opened them, something had shifted. The tightness in his face
  softened.


  "It tastes like..." He swallowed. "Like a summer I can''t remember."


  She smiled, because she understood the way memory hides in flavor, how it can slip
  away and then arrive like a friend at the door. "Then eat," she said. "Remember."


  They ate in silence, the kind that makes a room feel larger. When the bowl was empty,
  he looked up.


  "You didn''t have to do that."


  "I know," she said. "I wanted to."


  He nodded, a small, almost shy acknowledgment. "Walk with me."


  They stepped onto the balcony that overlooked the sea. The evening was warm, the
  sky bruised with sunset. He leaned on the railing, and she stood beside him, not
  touching, close enough that his sleeve brushed her arm.


  "You saved a restaurant once," he said, not a question.


  "My grandmother''s," Maya said. "I was eight. There was a flood. The kitchen was
  ruined. Everyone said start over somewhere else. She stayed. She cooked soup in
  a borrowed pot on a camp stove until the water went down. That''s what I remember."


  He was quiet for a long time. When he spoke, his voice was low. "I don''t let people
  in," he said. "It makes things simpler."


  Maya turned her head, looking at the line of his profile against the fading light.
  "It''s simpler," she agreed. "But it''s not easier."


  He smiled then, a small, real thing. "No," he said. "It''s not."


  They stood together, watching the sky turn from bruise to ember, and the space between
  them felt less like a contract and more like a choice. When he finally looked at
  her, she saw something that had not been there the day she signed the papers: trust,
  tentative but present, and a request she had not expected to hear.


  "Stay," he said. "Not because you have to. Because you want to."


  Maya felt the word settle in her chest like a stone finding the riverbed. She had
  come here to cook and to save a restaurant. She had not come to be known. But here,
  with the sea below and the taste of soup still in the air, she understood that the
  work and the person were no longer separate. She was not just making food for a
  man who had lost his sense of taste. She was making a place for him to remember,
  and in doing so, she was making a place for herself.


  "I want to," she said, and the word felt like a key turning in a lock. "I want to."'
