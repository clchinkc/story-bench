output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos." Sophie hesitated,
  then added, "But the meditation retreat... it changed things."


  "And how so?"


  Sophie looked down at her phone, where the work emails had piled up. She saw Linda''s
  name flash on the screen—three missed calls, an urgent message about the Pearson
  account. Her thumb hovered over the notification.


  "It''s funny," she said, slipping the phone back into her bag. "A month ago, I would''ve
  already been typing a response. But now..." She turned to watch the familiar Chicago
  skyline appear through the evening haze. The city lights blurred slightly as she
  blinked. "I don''t know. Maybe the account can wait until morning."


  Her mother glanced at her, surprised. "You''re not going to call her?"


  Sophie exhaled, her fingers tapping lightly against her knee. "I *could*. But I
  think... I think I need to be here first. Just for tonight."


  The car hummed along the highway. Sophie closed her eyes for a moment, the memory
  of the retreat''s quiet stillness pressing against the noise of the city outside.
  When she opened them again, the skyline was clearer, sharper—like she was seeing
  it for the first time.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, and for once, she meant it.'
