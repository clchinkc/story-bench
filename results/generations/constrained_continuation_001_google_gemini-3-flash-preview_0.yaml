output: "The tunnels of the Approach were not built for the living. The air grew thin,\
  \ tasting of copper and ancient dust, as Zara and Tomás descended into the Throat\
  \ of the Sands. Behind them, the rhythmic clatter of Scorpion Guild boots echoed\
  \ against the damp walls, a reminder that the price of failure was a blade in the\
  \ dark.\n\n\"There,\" Tomás gasped, pointing to a door of seamless obsidian. \"\
  The Gilded Lock. It’s said no one can bypass it without the key.\"\n\nZara didn't\
  \ wait for a key. She knelt, pulling a set of needle-thin picks from her collar.\
  \ The mechanism was a Labyrinth Tumbler, a thief’s nightmare designed to snap fingers\
  \ like dry twigs. She closed her eyes, feeling the internal gears shift through\
  \ the metal tools. Her breath slowed, syncing with the faint hum of the tumblers.\
  \ She wasn't just a thief from the slums anymore; she was a ghost in the machine.\
  \ With a sharp, metallic click, the obsidian slab groaned open.\n\nThey scrambled\
  \ through, but as the door began to slide shut, a heavy iron grate dropped between\
  \ them. Tomás was pinned beneath the leading edge of the gate, his legs trapped.\
  \ Beyond him, the first of the Scorpion Guild assassins rounded the corner, their\
  \ marked cloaks billowing and their curved daggers gleaming in the torchlight.\n\
  \n\"Leave me!\" Tomás shouted, his face pale with agony. \"The Library is just ahead.\
  \ If you stay, they’ll kill us both. Save your mother!\"\n\nZara looked at the open\
  \ path to the Library—the safety, the cure, the end of her desperate journey. Then\
  \ she looked at the man who had guided her. The girl she used to be would have run\
  \ without a second thought, but that girl hadn't survived the desert. She wedged\
  \ her crowbar into the grate’s gears, straining until her muscles screamed. With\
  \ a desperate, bone-cracking heave, she hauled Tomás inward just as the obsidian\
  \ door sealed the tunnel shut, locking the Scorpions out in the cold dark.\n\nTomás\
  \ slumped against the wall, clutching his bruised legs. \"Why? I’m just a failed\
  \ academic. I’m not worth your life.\"\n\n\"Nobody is 'just' anything,\" Zara spat,\
  \ wiping sweat from her brow. \"Why are you really here, Tomás? It’s not for the\
  \ books.\"\n\n\"I’m here because I have to be,\" he whispered, his voice cracking.\
  \ \"I wasn't disgraced for my theories, Zara. I was the Librarian’s apprentice.\
  \ I’m the one who let the Guild into the old archives for a bribe years ago. My\
  \ 'disgrace' is a debt I can never pay. I’m not helping you for the knowledge; I’m\
  \ helping you because I’m the reason your mother’s records were lost in the first\
  \ place.\"\n\nZara’s hand twitched toward her knife. The betrayal stung more than\
  \ the fatigue, a cold poison in her chest. But there was no time for vengeance.\
  \ The chamber pulsed with a low, rhythmic vibration, and the floor beneath them\
  \ began to dissolve.\n\nThis was the Inmost Cave—the heart of the Ordeal. The floor\
  \ vanished, replaced by a swirling vortex of sand that began to fill the chamber\
  \ from below. Zara tried to climb the walls, but the stone was slick as ice. As\
  \ the sand rose to her chest, the weight of her fears pressed down harder than the\
  \ grit. She saw her mother’s pale, wasting face and heard the whispers of the slums\
  \ telling her she was a nothing, a common criminal who would only ever bring ruin\
  \ to those she touched.\n\n*You will fail her,* the echoes hissed from the walls.\
  \ *You are the desert’s hunger, nothing more.*\n\nThe sand reached her chin. Zara\
  \ stopped fighting. She realized the sand reacted to her panic, thickening and rising\
  \ with every frantic heartbeat. She forced herself to go still, to accept the possibility\
  \ of her own end. In that moment of total surrender, the girl who stole only to\
  \ survive died. She wasn't a victim of the slums anymore. She was the master of\
  \ her own will.\n\nAs she let the sand pull her under, her foot struck a hidden\
  \ lever at the very bottom of the pit. The floor groaned and pivoted.\n\nZara tumbled\
  \ through a trapdoor, landing hard on cold marble. She was bruised and stripped\
  \ of her arrogance, but her eyes were clear. She reached back into the sand-chute\
  \ and hauled a gasping Tomás out before the passage sealed forever.\n\nThey stood\
  \ in a hall of infinite silence, surrounded by towering shelves of stone tablets.\
  \ But as Zara stepped forward, she realized the new complication. The Sunken Library\
  \ was a hall of mirrors, and every reflection showed a different path. \n\n\"The\
  \ map,\" she whispered, reaching for her vest. It was gone—lost in the vortex of\
  \ the sand."
