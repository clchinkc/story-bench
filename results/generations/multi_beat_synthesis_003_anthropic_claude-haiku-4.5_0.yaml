output: 'The Tsarina''s grand salon glittered with the kind of wealth that made Miri''s
  skin crawl. Oligarchs and their hangers-on swirled through rooms lined with stolen
  beauty, oblivious. She adjusted her diamond-tenured earpiece—actually a short-range
  communicator disguised by her team''s technical wizard, Dev—and took a champagne
  flute from a passing waiter. The Renaissance painting hung in Sorokin''s private
  study, third floor, behind a wall-mounted Vermeer as a decoy. Predictable. Arrogant.


  "Eyes on the painting," Miri murmured. Dev''s voice crackled back, calm: "Gallery''s
  secure. No motion sensors in that room—Sorokin trusts his guards too much." Of course
  he did. Men like that always did.


  Her crew moved like water. Marcus, the forger, lingered near the security office
  with a convincing story about a lost passport. Jade, the infiltrator, had befriended
  a junior guard and knew the patrol schedules by heart. Dev monitored from the tender
  boat docked below, ready to kill the external cameras for exactly ninety seconds.
  The plan had taken three months of preparation and cost more than most people earned
  in a year. It would be over in four minutes.


  Miri climbed the service staircase, her borrowed gown making soft sounds against
  the metal. The study was exactly as photographed. She approached the wall, running
  her fingers along the frame''s edge until she found the release. The Vermeer swung
  outward—and there it was. "Madonna and Child," stolen by the Nazis in 1943, missing
  for eighty years. The Amsterdam family''s legal heir had wept when they''d first
  contacted Miri about it.


  She had the painting free and secured in the flat case within seconds. Dev''s timer
  ticked in her ear. Eighty seconds left. She was already moving toward the exit staircase
  when she heard it: boots on marble. Too heavy. Too organized. Not Sorokin''s usual
  security.


  Then, through the study''s cracked door, she saw her. Eleanor Price, impeccably
  dressed in a charcoal suit, reviewing security footage with Sorokin''s head of detail.
  Miri''s throat went dry. Eleanor, who had trained her for fifteen years. Eleanor,
  who had planted the forgery in Miri''s apartment and lied to the police. Eleanor,
  who had destroyed her life and disappeared into the private security world where
  women like her thrived.


  The woman who had just become their problem looked directly at one of the hidden
  cameras and smiled, as if she could feel Miri watching.


  Thirty seconds left. Miri descended the service stairs at controlled speed, her
  heart hammering. The painting was secure. The escape route was clear. But Eleanor
  hadn''t hired on to this job randomly. She was waiting. Hunting. The rest of the
  crew felt it too—Dev''s breathing had sharpened, Marcus''s check-in call came too
  quickly.


  The real heist hadn''t started yet. This was the setup, and Miri had just discovered
  the stakes weren''t about returning stolen art anymore. They were about surviving
  a confrontation two years in the making.


  She pushed through the yacht''s lower level door onto the deck where the tender
  boat waited, Jade already positioned at the helm. The Mediterranean breeze hit her
  face, and Miri made a choice that would change everything: she wasn''t leaving.
  Not yet. Not until Eleanor understood that destroying Miriam Delacroix had only
  created something far more dangerous.'
