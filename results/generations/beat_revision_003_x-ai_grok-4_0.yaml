output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly." Sophie scrolled through her phone,
  checking the work emails that had piled up while she was away. "Oh, great. Three
  emergencies while I was gone. Linda needs me to call her tonight."


  "Can''t it wait until morning?"


  Sophie stared at the screen for a moment, the familiar pull of urgency tugging at
  her. But then she remembered the retreat''s lessons—the quiet power of letting go,
  of breathing through the chaos instead of drowning in it. She set the phone down
  in her lap, screen facing away. "You know, maybe it can. The Pearson account won''t
  fall apart if I take one night to breathe. I''ve spent too long letting it control
  me."


  Her mother glanced over, surprised. "That''s new."


  They drove in silence for a while. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through
  the evening haze. Sophie''s apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought
  her morning latte. Everything exactly as she''d left it, but now it felt different—like
  a canvas she could repaint, starting with boundaries she''d never set before.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, her voice steady with resolve, already envisioning
  a tomorrow where meetings didn''t eclipse everything else.


  Life had shifted.'
