output: 'The crew quarters told a story of sudden departure. Yuki found personal belongings
  scattered across unmade beds, half-eaten meals still on tables, research tablets
  displaying incomplete equations. No signs of struggle. No bodies. It was as if forty-seven
  people had simply vanished mid-sentence.


  In the medical bay, she discovered something more troubling. Patient files showed
  increasing reports of "temporal displacement episodes" over the past month—crew
  members claiming to see through walls, experiencing multiple realities simultaneously.
  Dr. Chen''s final log entry made her blood run cold: "The dimensional barriers are
  thinning. The cure works by existing in quantum superposition, but the human subjects..."


  The file cut off abruptly.


  A shadow moved in her peripheral vision. Yuki spun around, scanner raised, but saw
  only empty corridor. Then another flicker—a human shape that wasn''t quite there,
  like looking at someone through water.


  "Who''s there?" she called out.


  The temperature dropped ten degrees. Whispers filled the air, overlapping voices
  speaking in languages that hurt to hear. The shadows began to coalesce, reaching
  toward her with fingers that existed in too many dimensions at once.


  Yuki backed against the wall, her scanner shrieking warnings about temporal anomalies.
  The transformed crew pressed closer, their forms shifting between human and something
  incomprehensible. They weren''t trying to communicate—they were trying to drag her
  into their fractured existence.


  She grabbed a plasma torch from the medical cabinet and ignited it. The brilliant
  light scattered the shadows temporarily, giving her space to run. Behind her, the
  whispers followed, speaking words that sounded almost like "help us" and "join us"
  and "don''t go."


  Racing through the corridors, Yuki''s mind worked frantically. Dimensional transformation.
  Quantum superposition. They weren''t dead—they existed between realities, trapped
  by their own breakthrough.


  And if Commander Reyes''s final transmission was accurate, the data core containing
  their sacrifice was waiting in Lab Seven.'
