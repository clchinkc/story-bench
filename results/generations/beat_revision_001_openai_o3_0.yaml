output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword a lead weight in
  trembling fingers. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning
  eyes, the living shape of every nightmare she had nursed since the day her brother
  fell.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. "Stronger warriors have tried…
  and each begged for the forgiveness they never earned, just as your brother did
  when you left him behind."


  The words struck harder than flame. Guilt surged up, choking thought, and the world
  narrowed to the rim of the abyss at her heels. Memories blurred with the dragon’s
  mocking voice: training bouts where her brother laughed, promising she could rise
  from any fall. Three times she was knocked down, and three times she rose again—that
  had been his lesson, not a boast. Yet on the fourth he had died while she hid, and
  the shame had never stopped burning.


  A swipe of the dragon’s claw hurled her backward; she dangled over emptiness, fingers
  slipping on crumbling stone. For a heartbeat she let go inside, surrendering to
  the dark that said she deserved the plunge. It was a small death—accepting that
  she could not rewrite the past. In that surrender, something shifted: her brother’s
  lesson was not about erasing failure, but standing anyway.


  With a cry that was half sob, half birth-shout, she hauled herself up and met the
  dragon’s next jet of shadow-flame head-on, angling her shield to split the torrent.
  The reflected blaze lit a seam beneath its foreleg—an opening she had never noticed
  in earlier passes, as if revealed only by this new clarity.


  She surged forward. The dragon lunged, overextending, and she drove her blade through
  the gap, piercing its heart. The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar,
  black wings thrashing once before lying still.


  Kira knelt, not in exhaustion but in silent thanks. The guilt remained, but it no
  longer owned her; it was part of the fire she would carry home.'
