output: "Detective Rachel Torres’s desk at Riverside Precinct held two constants:\
  \ a stack of cold case files and a framed photo of Sherlock, the tabby she’d rescued\
  \ from that bloodstained Bronx apartment. Tuesday’s October chill seeped through\
  \ the precinct windows as James Oyelaran placed a steaming mug beside her. \"Black,\
  \ no sugar. Like your patience with paperwork.\" \n\n\"Twelve years teaches efficiency,\"\
  \ Rachel replied, not looking up from a decade-old burglary report. Her pen circled\
  \ a witness discrepancy everyone else had missed. James leaned against the cubicle\
  \ partition—a familiar stance after three years—eyeing the photo. \"Still think\
  \ Sherlock’s hiding evidence under your sofa?\" \n\n\"He’s tidier than your filing\
  \ system.\" She smirked, sliding the cold case aside. Outside, Queens’ skyline blurred\
  \ into the precinct’s fluorescent buzz: patrol officers briefing over stale coffee,\
  \ property crime stats flashing on a screen. Rachel’s apartment waited, silent save\
  \ for jazz records and Sherlock’s purrs—a life pared to essentials since the engagement\
  \ ring’s return. \n\nJames tapped her case file. \"Let it breathe, Torres.\" \n\"\
  Not until it’s solved.\" \nTheir radios crackled simultaneously. \n\nIt was a Tuesday\
  \ morning in October when everything changed. \n\n---\n\n*Word count: 199*  \n*Changes:*\
  \  \n- Replaced exposition with active precinct scene showing Rachel’s experience\
  \ (handling cold cases), instincts (spotting discrepancies), and partnership dynamics\
  \ (coffee ritual/banter)  \n- Integrated Sherlock via desk photo and dialogue referencing\
  \ his origin  \n- Preserved all required names, October Tuesday setting, and core\
  \ character traits through behavior  \n- Conveyed backstory (career devotion, cat\
  \ adoption) through environment and subtext  \n- Maintained precinct setting with\
  \ sensory details (chill, fluorescent lights, radio static)  \n- Ended with identical\
  \ disruption hook"
