output: 'Eleanor carried the manuscript to her father''s office, now hers by law if
  not by years of preparation. The leather chair still held the impression of his
  body. She settled into it, feeling like an imposter, and began to read.


  The pages were meticulous. Her father had documented the patterns—the dates, the
  locations, the speculation circulating among Scotland Yard. But more than that,
  he had woven them into narrative, transforming clinical brutality into something
  that would grip readers with an urgency that transcended morbid curiosity. This
  was not sensationalism. This was an indictment of a city that permitted such horrors
  to persist in its poorest corners.


  The final pages chilled her most. Her father had written a preface: *"The public
  must demand justice for these women. Only through awareness, through unflinching
  examination of what darkness prowls our streets, can we compel those with power
  to act. Silence is complicity."*


  She found Thomas in the composing room the next morning, his practiced hands arranging
  type for a ladies'' periodical—profitable, respectable, and utterly forgettable.


  "The manuscript," she said without preamble. "How much would it cost to serialize
  it?"


  Thomas set down his tools deliberately. "Miss Blackwood, I cannot advise—"


  "I''m not asking for advice. I''m asking for figures."


  He studied her face as though reading proof for errors. "Printing costs would be
  modest. Paper, ink, binding. Perhaps forty pounds to launch it as a monthly serial.
  But the true cost..." He paused. "The true cost would be reputation. And safety."


  "Safety?"


  "Your father made inquiries. Interviewed witnesses in Whitechapel. Some did not
  wish to be questioned. There are men who profit from the confusion—landlords, constables,
  certain businessmen. A publication demanding accountability..." Thomas trailed off
  significantly.


  Eleanor understood. Publishing her father''s work would transform the printing house
  from a dying business into a target.


  "But if we succeed?" she asked.


  "If we succeed, we expose truths that matter. And we might stabilize the company.
  People will buy newspapers that ask questions others won''t. Especially now, with
  the killings continuing." He hesitated, then added quietly, "My own family lives
  in Whitechapel, Miss Blackwood. My sister works as a seamstress there. My father
  believed we had an obligation to use our skills for more than profits."


  Eleanor realized then that her father had confided in Thomas, had trusted him with
  the weight of this decision.


  That evening, she sat at her father''s desk and composed a letter to the creditors,
  requesting a meeting. Her hands trembled slightly as she wrote, but her words were
  steady. She would explain her plan—a serial publication that would capture the imagination
  of London. Controversial, yes, but viable.


  At dawn, she returned to the printing house and pulled the manuscript from her bag.
  She placed it on the composing table beside yesterday''s ladies'' periodical.


  "We begin with the first installment," she said to Thomas, who arrived moments later.
  "In four weeks. We''ll publish under my father''s pseudonym, but we''ll make certain
  his publisher''s name is known to those who matter."


  Thomas''s expression shifted—gratitude, fear, and determination intermingled. "You
  understand you cannot undo this, Miss Blackwood?"


  "I understand perfectly, Mr. Chen. For the first time in my life, I understand exactly
  what I''m doing."


  She pulled the first pages toward the composing station. The real work was about
  to begin.'
