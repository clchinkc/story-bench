output: 'She found him in the kitchen at two in the morning, surrounded by the wreckage
  of what had clearly been an attempt at his mother''s paella recipe.


  "The sofrito burned," Alejandro said without looking up. Rice scattered across the
  marble counter. Saffron stained his fingers yellow. "She made it every Sunday. I
  thought I remembered how, but—" He gestured helplessly at the ruined pan.


  Maya had been at the estate for three months. In that time, she''d learned his preferences,
  his allergies, his hatred of cilantro. But she''d never seen him like this: unguarded,
  grief-raw, trying to resurrect something that couldn''t be resurrected through sheer
  force of will.


  "When did she pass?"


  "Four years ago. Today." He finally met her eyes, and the famous Alejandro Vega—the
  man who''d won World Cups, who''d smiled for cameras while his marriage imploded
  publicly—looked utterly lost. "I thought cooking it might... I don''t know. Bring
  her back for a moment."


  Maya should have offered condolences and retreated to bed. That''s what the contract
  demanded: professional distance, clean boundaries.


  Instead, she rolled up her sleeves.


  "Show me what you remember," she said. "The parts that mattered to her."


  They cooked together until dawn. He told her how his mother had added a secret pinch
  of smoked paprika, how she''d sung while she stirred, how the smell of saffron still
  made his chest ache. Maya listened, adjusted, guided his hands when they faltered.
  When the paella was finally done—imperfect, nothing like a professional chef would
  serve—Alejandro took one bite and his eyes went bright with tears he refused to
  shed.


  "It''s not quite right," he said roughly.


  "No," Maya agreed. "But it''s close. And next Sunday, we''ll get closer."


  He looked at her then with something new in his expression. Something that made
  her pulse skip dangerously.


  Later, walking back to her quarters as the Mediterranean sunrise painted the villa
  gold, Maya realized the contract no longer mattered. The money, the restaurant,
  the six-month countdown—all of it had faded to background noise.


  She was staying because she wanted to see him smile again.


  That was the moment everything changed, though she wouldn''t understand how much
  until it was far too late.'
