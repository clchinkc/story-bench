output: 'Maya found him in the kitchen at two in the morning, standing barefoot in
  front of the open refrigerator with the same lost expression she''d seen on her
  grandmother''s face after the stroke—when familiar things suddenly became foreign.


  "I couldn''t remember," Alejandro said quietly, not looking at her. "The taste.
  My mother used to make arroz con leche, but I can''t..." He stopped, jaw tight.
  "It''s been happening more. Since the injury. Entire memories just—gone."


  Maya had read about the concussions, the header that ended his career. She hadn''t
  known about this.


  "Tell me what you do remember," she said, moving beside him.


  He closed his eyes. "Cinnamon. Lemon peel. The way the spoon would scrape the bottom
  of the pot. She''d let me stir it while she..." His voice cracked slightly. "I can''t
  see her face anymore when I try."


  Maya understood then why he''d driven away seven chefs. They''d been feeding a man
  who was slowly losing the ability to hold onto what mattered most. Every missed
  flavor was another piece of his mother slipping away.


  "We''ll find it," she said. "Together."


  They cooked through the night, testing ratios, adjusting heat. Maya watched him
  taste each variation with an intensity that had nothing to do with food and everything
  to do with fighting against loss. When his eyes finally widened—when he took that
  seventh spoonful and went completely still—she saw the wall crack.


  "That''s it." He set down the spoon with a trembling hand. "Exactly. Maya, that''s
  exactly—" He turned to her, and his expression was so raw it hurt to witness. "Thank
  you."


  She should have said something professional. Something that maintained the boundaries.


  Instead, she reached for his hand. "You don''t have to eat alone anymore. Any of
  it. If you want—I mean, if you''d like someone to..." She took a breath. "I''d like
  to share meals with you. Really share them. Not just cook and leave."


  "Maya." Her name sounded different in his mouth now. Careful. Hopeful. "You don''t
  have to—the contract doesn''t require—"


  "This isn''t about the contract."


  The words hung between them, true and terrifying. Somewhere in the past three months,
  feeding him had become caring for him. And she wasn''t ready to stop, money or no
  money, six months or six years.


  Alejandro''s fingers tightened around hers. "Tomorrow night? Dinner together?"


  "Tomorrow," she promised, and meant it as more than she could yet name.'
