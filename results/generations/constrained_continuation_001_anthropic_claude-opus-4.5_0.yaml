output: 'The passage was barely wide enough for one person, carved into the bedrock
  centuries ago by hands long dead. Zara pressed forward, Tomás''s ragged breathing
  close behind her, while shouts echoed from the market above. The torchlight faded.
  Soon they moved in absolute darkness, her fingers reading the walls like a blind
  woman.


  Then Tomás stumbled. His cry of pain was sharp, immediate—his ankle caught in a
  gap between stones.


  "Go," he hissed. "The Scorpion Guild knows these tunnels. You have minutes."


  She could. The map was hers. She''d survived alone before, owed this man nothing.
  But her mother''s face flickered in her mind—the way she''d nursed sick neighbors
  even when they had nothing, even when it cost them. Zara cursed and turned back,
  working Tomás''s boot free with practiced fingers.


  "Why are you helping me?" she demanded as she pulled him upright. "The truth."


  In the darkness, she heard him swallow. "My daughter. She died of the same sickness
  your mother has. Three years ago. I was too much a coward to seek the Library then."
  His voice cracked. "I couldn''t save her. But maybe I can help you save someone."


  Grief she understood. Guilt too. She pulled his arm over her shoulder. "Then we
  move together."


  The passage opened into a chamber that stank of ancient dust. Zara''s eyes adjusted
  to faint phosphorescent moss on the walls, revealing a floor riddled with pressure
  stones—a thieves'' nightmare, the kind of trap designed to catch the unwary. One
  wrong step would bring the ceiling down.


  "Can you cross it?" Tomás asked.


  Zara studied the pattern, her mind falling into the cold calculations of her craft.
  Weight distribution. Timing. The gaps between triggers. She''d cracked harder puzzles
  in the vaults of merchant lords.


  "Stay here. Step only where I step."


  She moved like water over the stones, each footfall precise, her body remembering
  the dance of survival she''d learned in the capital''s deadly underbelly. Twice
  she froze as stone groaned beneath her. Twice she adjusted, found the safe path.
  Tomás followed her trail exactly, and they emerged on the far side as dust rained
  from the ceiling behind them.


  The next chamber was the Ordeal.


  Water. Black and still, flooding the passage completely, with no visible end. The
  Sunken Library earned its name.


  Zara stared at that dark surface and felt her chest tighten. Not fear of drowning—fear
  of something worse. What if she made it through and found nothing? What if the cure
  didn''t exist? What if she''d abandoned everything, become a thief and a fugitive,
  and still failed her mother?


  She''d spent so long running toward hope that she''d never let herself imagine the
  alternative.


  "I can''t promise what''s on the other side," Tomás said quietly. "But I know what''s
  behind us."


  Zara drew a breath and dove.


  The water was cold as death, pressing against her from all sides. She swam blind,
  lungs burning, the darkness so complete she couldn''t tell up from down. Her chest
  screamed. Her vision sparked. She thought of her mother''s hands, gentle on her
  forehead during childhood fevers, and pulled herself forward.


  She broke the surface gasping, reborn into torchlight and air.


  Tomás emerged seconds later, coughing. They lay on cold stone, breathing, alive.


  Zara felt different. Lighter, somehow. The fear of failure hadn''t vanished—but
  she''d carried it through the water and survived. It no longer owned her.


  Then she looked up and saw the gate to the Sunken Library, ancient and sealed.


  And the three Scorpion Guild assassins waiting before it, their blades already drawn.'
