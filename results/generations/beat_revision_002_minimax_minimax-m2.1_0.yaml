output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  "I don''t know." Marcus slumped into his chair. "We could try to find another location,
  but the rent anywhere else would be triple what we pay here."


  "What about the fundraiser? We still have three weeks. If we could raise enough—"


  "Denise." He looked up at her. "I got an email today. From Crawford''s company.
  Congratulations on your new position. When did you apply?"


  The silence stretched between them.


  "I''m sorry," she whispered. "They offered me salary and benefits I could never—"


  "Get out."


  She gathered her things and left. Marcus sat alone in the empty conference room.


  His phone buzzed. A text from his wife: "I''ve been thinking. I can''t do this anymore.
  I''m staying at my sister''s. I need space."


  He rubbed his temples. The fundraiser would take weeks they didn''t have. The grant
  application wouldn''t come through in time. Every door he approached would be locked,
  every phone call go unanswered.


  He thought about the kids who''d come through those doors—first as shy eleven-year-olds,
  then as counselors, then as parents themselves. A family he''d built over fifteen
  years, gone in thirty days.


  Marcus folded the eviction notice carefully and placed it on the desk. Then he put
  his head in his hands and wept.'
