output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director. Her
  voice was thin, clinging to a hope that Marcus could no longer feel.


  "It’s over, Denise." Marcus slumped into his chair, the weight of fifteen years
  of futile effort crushing his spine. "The fundraiser fell fifty thousand short.
  The emergency grant was denied this morning. Every door is locked."


  "But the kids—"


  "The kids are going back to the streets." He rubbed his temples, feeling the hollow
  ache of a man who had failed a generation. "The board resigned an hour ago. They’ve
  already started freezing the accounts."


  Denise looked at him, her eyes red-rimmed. She didn''t offer a plan. She didn''t
  offer a hand. She simply picked up her coat from the back of her chair, her loyalty
  finally exhausted by his failure. "I can''t be here when they chain the doors, Marcus.
  I just can''t."


  She walked out without looking back, her footsteps echoing through the hallway like
  a funeral march.


  His phone buzzed. It was a notification from his joint bank account, not a message
  of support. His wife had withdrawn her half of their remaining savings. A follow-up
  text followed: *The bank called about the house. I told you this program would cost
  us everything. I’m staying at my mother’s. Don''t call.*


  The silence of the center felt like a tomb. He had sacrificed his marriage, his
  financial security, and his reputation for a dream that was now a corpse. He sat
  alone in the growing dark, the eviction notice slipping from his numb fingers to
  the floor. There were no cards left to play. There was only the cold, suffocating
  reality of total defeat.'
