output: 'The scent of stale coffee and old paper was as familiar to Detective Rachel
  Torres as her own heartbeat. It clung to the Riverside Precinct’s air, a constant
  companion through a decade of early mornings and late nights. Her hand, calloused
  from years of gripping a service weapon and countless case files, reached for the
  mug. The steam kissed her face as she took a long sip of black coffee, the bitterness
  a welcome jolt.


  Across the worn desk, Detective James Oyelaran sorted through a stack of reports,
  his movements efficient. “Another Tuesday, another mountain of paperwork,” he grumbled,
  but a faint smile played on his lips. Rachel grunted in agreement, scanning the
  precinct’s bulletin board. Her gaze lingered on a faded missing persons poster from
  three years prior, a case that still gnawed at her. She’d spent countless hours
  on it, long after others had moved on.


  A soft meow echoed from the small, cluttered apartment Rachel had left hours ago
  in Queens. Sherlock, her sleek black cat, would be demanding breakfast. She pictured
  him perched on the window sill, observing the street below with an unnerving intensity
  she’d once only seen in witnesses at a crime scene. She’d found him, a scrawny kitten,
  curled beside a victim’s body, clinging to life. He’d been hers ever since.


  The precinct hummed with the usual morning chaos—phones ringing, distant sirens,
  the rhythmic clack of keyboards. Property crime reports had been ticking up lately,
  a subtle shift in the neighborhood’s pulse. Rachel felt it, a low thrum beneath
  the surface calm, waiting.


  It was a Tuesday morning in October when everything changed.'
