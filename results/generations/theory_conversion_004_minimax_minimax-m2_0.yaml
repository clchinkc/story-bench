output: 'Zoe Chen shelved books in the cool quiet of the Millbrook Public Library,
  seventeen and careful, the way she liked things. The library smelled like dust and
  staplers, and she could disappear into other people’s stories instead of living
  her own. She liked being needed without being seen. Comfort was a shelf you could
  find in the dark.


  What was missing, she didn’t name. She felt it when the summer program meeting ended
  and the other kids filed out, when Ms. Okafor said oral history interviews with
  Millbrook’s oldest residents, when she said their stories deserve to be preserved.
  Zoe’s hand stayed down. Talking to strangers and recording their voices felt like
  standing on a stage made of ice. She could barely order coffee without rehearsing
  what to say.


  She left the quiet anyway. Ms. Okafor found her hiding in the stacks. I saw you
  reading Terkel last week, she said. You understand why stories matter. That’s rarer
  than you think. She handed Zoe a recorder. Just one interview. Try. Zoe crossed
  the threshold with it humming in her pocket, a small, unfamiliar animal.


  She learned by trying. Her first interview was with Bernard Park, 89, a Korean War
  veteran who’d lived in Millbrook for sixty years. She showed up terrified, questions
  written on index cards, her voice shaking. The second was worse. The third was a
  stumble. But by the fifth, something shifted. The old voices started to trust her.
  She learned that listening was its own kind of courage. Her mother, who wanted her
  to get a real summer job, became her obstacle. Bernard became her greatest ally.
  She learned the rhythm of pauses, the way eyes close when memory opens. She learned
  that courage could be quiet.


  She found the breakthrough with Bernard in the aisle between shelves where he told
  her he’d never told anyone about what really happened in Korea. You’re the first
  person who ever asked the right questions, he said. He wanted to tell her—but only
  if she’d share his story publicly. Zoe had never been asked to take responsibility
  for someone else’s voice. The town hall was a hundred people, the microphone a bright
  eye. Bernard’s story of survival, guilt, and grace poured through her. She stood
  there, the girl who couldn’t order coffee without rehearsing, giving voice to someone
  else’s truth. The standing ovation was a warm wind, but the reward was Bernard’s
  handshake, his eyes wet. You heard me, he said. That’s all any of us want.


  She returned to ordinary life changed. The summer ended. The program concluded.
  Other volunteers drifted away. But Zoe kept visiting Bernard, kept recording, kept
  asking. The library still smelled like dust and staplers, and she still liked the
  quiet, but she wasn’t hiding anymore.


  Change showed itself in action. Bernard passed in October. His family asked Zoe
  to speak at the funeral. This time, she wasn’t giving voice to someone else’s story.
  She was sharing her own: what Bernard had taught her about listening, about courage,
  about the stories that connect us. Her hands were steady. Senior year, she applied
  to journalism programs. Her essay was about Millbrook’s forgotten voices. She still
  couldn’t order coffee without rehearsing—but she could stand in front of a hundred
  strangers and make them listen. The recorder hummed again in her pocket, and she
  walked toward it.'
