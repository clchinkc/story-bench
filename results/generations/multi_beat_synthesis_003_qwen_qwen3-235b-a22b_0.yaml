output: "The Monaco Grand Prix roared in the distance as the *Tsarina*’s deck shimmered\
  \ with champagne flutes and stolen art. Miri Delacroix leaned against a gilded railing,\
  \ her emerald gown masking a tactical earpiece. “Camera loop is live,” hissed Anya,\
  \ her crew’s hacker, voice crackling through Miri’s comms. “Sixty seconds to the\
  \ fireworks.”  \n\nBelow, Nikolai, the crew’s sleight-of-hand artist in a rented\
  \ tux, plucked a diamond cufflink from a guest’s wrist and replaced it with a fake—a\
  \ distraction as he slipped past Sorokin’s guards to the lower deck. Miri’s eyes\
  \ tracked his progress. “Security’s thinning,” she murmured. “Showtime.”  \n\nThe\
  \ fireworks exploded, gold bursts drowning out Nikolai’s撬 lock. He slid into the\
  \ yacht’s private gallery, swapping the Nazi-looted Raphael with a replica. Miri\
  \ watched Sorokin on the main deck, laughing as he downed vodka. “Boss, you’re gonna\
  \ love this,” Nikolai whispered, the painting secured. “Oh, I already do,” Miri\
  \ quipped.  \n\nThen—a flicker. A guard lingered near the fake, tilting his head.\
  \ “He sees it,” Anya hissed. Miri cursed. “Abort. Now.”  \n\nThey scattered. Nikolai\
  \ vanished into the crowd; Miri melted into shadows, but not before spotting the\
  \ guard radioing someone—*not* Sorokin. A woman’s silhouette stood at the gallery’s\
  \ threshold, backlit by strobing lights. Familiar. Cold.  \n\nFalse confidence crumbled\
  \ two decks below. Miri shoved the Raphael into Anya’s hands. “Get it to the dinghy.”\
  \ The hacker froze. “Security’s got the docks locked. Sorokin’s not even *worried*—this\
  \ was too easy.” Miri’s stomach dropped. The woman from the gallery materialized\
  \ on a nearby screen, crisp British accent cutting through the comms: “Looking for\
  \ me, darling?”  \n\nEleanor Voss. Miri’s mentor. The woman who’d framed her years\
  \ ago. “She’s running security,” Anya breathed. “All of it.” The yacht shuddered—Eleanor\
  \ had rerouted the escape paths Miri had scouted. The Raphael’s rightful owners,\
  \ a family in Amsterdam, felt suddenly distant. Revenge prickled Miri’s spine. “Change\
  \ of plans,” she growled. “We burn this ship down.”  \n\nThe *Tsarina*’s party swirled\
  \ obliviously as Eleanor’s voice boomed over intercoms. “Exit doors sealed. Sweeping\
  \ the decks in three minutes.” Trapped. Miri’s crew huddled in a dim corridor, Luca—the\
  \ youngest, barely twenty—trembling. “I’m sorry,” he stammered. Guards yanked him\
  \ into view, a gun at his temple. “Your call,” Eleanor taunted.  \n\nMiri’s mind\
  \ raced. Nikolai nudged her arm—a silent nod to the maintenance grate above. Beat\
  \ 1’s distraction: he’d noted the ventilation layout while planting the replica.\
  \ But Anya was already sprinting, her tech skills useless now. “Go,” Miri ordered.\
  \ “I’ll handle Eleanor.”  \n\n“*You* taught her,” Nikolai shot back. A beat. A choice.\
  \ Miri shoved the Raphael into his arms. “Then I know how she thinks.”  \n\nShe\
  \ descended alone. Eleanor waited at the yacht’s helm, a silver-haired specter.\
  \ “Still playing hero?” she purred. “That family in Amsterdam? They’re paying *me*\
  \ to keep the painting. Funny how justice bends.” Miri lunged, but alarms blared—Eleanor’s\
  \ guards closed in.  \n\nAbove, Nikolai shoved the painting into Anya’s hands. “Vent\
  \ to the dock,” he barked. “Miri’s not coming?” Luca rasped. The magician grinned\
  \ bleakly. “She’s got a mentor to kill.”  \n\nAs the *Tsarina*’s lights converged\
  \ on Miri, Eleanor sighed. “You never learned the first rule: Trust nobody.” Miri\
  \ smiled. “Funny. That’s why I’m still here.” She slammed a champagne bottle, glass\
  \ exploding—and Nikolai’s hidden distraction ignited: the real fireworks, timed\
  \ to the Grand Prix’s final lap. Chaos. Escape.  \n\nThe Raphael floated to safety.\
  \ Miri’s revenge slipped away, but not her crew. Some victories were measured in\
  \ degrees."
