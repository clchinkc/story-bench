output: 'Sarah sat at her kitchen table, the photograph of Amy between her hands.
  The timer on the counter showed seventy-one hours and counting.


  Recant.


  The word echoed in her skull. She could stand in front of the jury, apologize for
  her mistake, and Vincent Marchetti would walk free. Amy would come home. The nightmare
  would end.


  But she''d watched Marchetti order four men killed in cold blood. She''d testified
  to seeing his finger pull the trigger, the muzzle flash illuminating his face. Recanting
  meant lying under oath, letting a murderer go free, telling every victim of his
  crimes that justice was negotiable.


  She couldn''t do it.


  So she''d go to Morrison. Tell him everything. The department would put Amy in protective
  custody. They''d raid the warehouse. They''d catch the bastards.


  Sarah''s phone buzzed. Marcus.


  She answered. Twenty minutes later, he sat across from her, coffee growing cold
  between them.


  "We''re partners," Marcus said, his voice steady. "You tell me these things. We
  go to Morrison together, get Amy protected, and Task Force One can move by morning."


  "It won''t work."


  "Chen, I''ve worked this job for twelve years. We''ve taken down bigger fish than—"


  "The department''s compromised." The words came flat, factual. "Marchetti''s lawyer
  mentioned details that only someone inside could know. Evidence numbers. Witness
  protection locations. Someone''s feeding him everything."


  Marcus went silent. She watched him process it, the same analytical mind she trusted
  running through the same impossible calculations.


  "So we go to Internal Affairs. Go over Morrison''s head."


  "Every channel we have, he''s watching. Every cop we trust, we don''t know which
  ones are his. The moment we move, Amy becomes a target. Not tomorrow. Now."


  She stood, moved to the window. Below, traffic crawled past, oblivious. Normal people
  living normal lives.


  "There''s only one play," she said quietly.


  "Which is?"


  Don''t recant. Don''t trust the system. Go outside both.


  The thought formed slowly, dreadfully, like a tumor she''d been refusing to name.
  If she couldn''t work inside the rules and she couldn''t live with breaking them,
  she''d have to work without them entirely.


  Sarah closed her eyes. Her partner, her badge, her career—all of it would have to
  be sacrificed on the altar of getting Amy back.


  And Vincent Marchetti was still going to prison.


  She turned back to Marcus, her face unreadable. "I need you to trust me. Don''t
  ask questions. Not yet."


  "Chen—"


  "Please."


  Something in her voice made him nod slowly. She saw the confusion in his eyes, the
  worry. He''d never seen her like this. Neither had she.


  Sarah picked up her phone. Seventy hours left. Time to start saying goodbye.'
