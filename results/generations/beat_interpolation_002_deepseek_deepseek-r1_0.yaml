output: 'Sarah paced the cracked linoleum of her tiny kitchen, the photograph of Amy
  a burning brand against her fingertips. Recant. Say she’d lied under oath. Vincent
  Marchetti walks, Amy lives. The equation was brutally simple. Her stomach churned
  at the thought of freeing the man who’d executed a family in cold blood, the image
  she’d witnessed seared into her memory as indelibly as the red marker on the photo.
  Could she live with that? Could Amy, knowing the price? The easy path felt like
  swallowing acid.


  Duty warred with terror. She was a detective. The system existed for a reason. She
  grabbed her phone, fingers flying to dial Marcus Webb, her partner. He answered
  on the first ring, voice thick with sleep. "Chen? What''s wrong?"


  "Webb. It''s Amy." Her voice cracked, betraying the iron control she usually wielded.
  She spilled the facts: the photo, the call, the demand. "We need to move. Wiretap
  that number. Track the source. Get Vice, Organized Crime, a full task force—"


  "Sarah, slow down," Webb interrupted, concern sharpening his tone. "We will. First
  light, we bring this to Morrison. We get warrants. We flood the zone. We find her.
  That''s the play." His certainty was meant to be reassuring, the bedrock of procedure.


  But it felt like quicksand. "Seventy-two hours, Marcus. Warrants take time Morrison
  might not push for. Task forces leak like sieves." The unspoken truth hung heavy:
  the Marchettis had eyes and ears *inside*. How deep? Who could she trust? A single
  misstep, a whispered word reaching the wrong person, and Amy was dead. The official
  channels, her fortress, now felt like a cage lined with knives pointed at her sister.


  She ended the call, Webb’s promises echoing hollowly. Recanting was surrender, a
  betrayal of everything she stood for. Going through channels was a gamble with Amy’s
  life as the stake, the odds stacked by corruption she couldn’t map. Both options
  led to ruin. She stared at her badge, gleaming dully on the counter beside Amy’s
  terrified image. The system couldn’t save Amy. Not fast enough. Not cleanly enough.
  Not without playing by rules the enemy had already broken. A cold, desperate resolve
  crystallized. There had to be another way. A way only she could take, outside the
  lines. The badge couldn’t help her now. It was the one thing holding her back.'
