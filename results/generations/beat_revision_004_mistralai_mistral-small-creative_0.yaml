output: 'The precinct’s fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as Rachel Torres adjusted
  the blinds in her office, letting in a sliver of October sunlight. Outside, Queens
  hummed with the usual Tuesday morning chaos—honking cabs, the distant wail of an
  ambulance, the scent of fresh bagels from the deli across the street. She took a
  sip of black coffee, the bitter heat grounding her, and flipped open the case file
  on her desk. The cold case file. Again.


  James Oyelaran leaned against her doorframe, arms crossed, watching her with that
  quiet amusement he saved for her obsessions. “You’re going to wear out the ink on
  that one,” he said, nodding at the file. “Or at least the coffee stains.”


  Rachel didn’t look up. “It’s got teeth. I can feel it.” She tapped the edge of the
  file against her desk, a rhythm only she could hear. Sherlock, the orange tabby
  curled on the windowsill, flicked his tail in agreement—or maybe just at the sound
  of her voice. He’d been a crime scene stray, all skin and bones, when she’d scooped
  him up two years ago. Now he ruled the precinct’s back office like a furry lieutenant,
  tolerated by the other detectives because he had the good sense to stay out of their
  cases.


  James pushed off the doorframe and dropped a fresh case file onto her desk. “New
  one just came in. Property theft, high-end electronics. Captain wants us on it.”
  His tone was light, but his eyes held the unspoken question: *You good to let this
  one go?*


  Rachel exhaled through her nose, fingers stilling on the cold case file. The precinct’s
  hum faded into the background—the clatter of keyboards, the murmur of dispatch,
  the distant ring of a phone. She glanced at Sherlock, who stretched lazily before
  hopping down to weave between her ankles. A silent vote of confidence.


  “Yeah,” she said, closing the cold case file with a snap. “I’m good.” But her gaze
  lingered on the tabby’s scarred ear—a reminder of where he’d come from, and why
  she couldn’t let go of the cases that refused to stay buried.'
