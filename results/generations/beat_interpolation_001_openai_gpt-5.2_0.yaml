output: 'Morning brought a thin, guilty light and the stubborn fact that Elena still
  knew where the map was—glowing on her grandmother’s table like an accusation that
  refused to be shelved. She meant to return only to fold it away, to prove to herself
  that last night had been a moment of melodrama and poor sleep.


  Instead, she found herself standing before a narrow storefront wedged between the
  baker and the cobbler, its window crowded with tarnished spyglasses, cracked music
  boxes, and jars of things that absolutely should not have had labels. MARCUS & SONS:
  CURIOSITIES, the sign read, though Elena had never seen a son, and the paint looked
  older than most local grudges.


  A bell chimed as she stepped inside. The air smelled of dust, metal, and lemon oil—like
  the library’s rare-book room after rain.


  Marcus looked up from a workbench where he was repairing a brass hinge with hands
  that moved too precisely to be merely a shopkeeper. His hair was gone to gray, his
  posture easy in the way of someone who had learned the hard way not to waste tension.
  His eyes flicked to Elena’s ink-stained fingers.


  “You’re the one the map chose,” he said, as if noting an overdue book.


  Elena’s mouth went dry. “Maps don’t choose. And even if they did, they have terrible
  taste.”


  Marcus’s smile didn’t mock; it measured. He reached beneath the counter and set
  down a worn leather satchel. “You won’t outfight Thornwood. Don’t try. You’ll outthink
  it. You notice patterns. You read what others skim.”


  “I shelve romances,” Elena muttered, then hated how small it sounded.


  “Then you know how stories lie,” Marcus replied. He slid a brass compass toward
  her; its needle quivered, restless. “This doesn’t point north. It points true. When
  you feel foolish, check it. When you feel brave, check it again.”


  He added a slim notebook, blank but for a few careful headings, and a stub of charcoal.
  “Catalogue what you see. Names matter in old places.”


  Elena stared at the satchel as if it might bite. “I’m not—” A hero. A spellcaster.
  Someone worth a quest.


  Marcus’s gaze held steady. “No,” he said. “You’re Elena. That will have to be enough.”


  Her doubt didn’t vanish. It simply shifted, making room for something heavier: responsibility.
  She curled her fingers around the compass, and the needle steadied as if, reluctantly,
  so did she.'
