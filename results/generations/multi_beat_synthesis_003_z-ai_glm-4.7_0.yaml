output: 'The roar of Formula 1 engines vibrated through the hull of the *Tsarina*,
  a perfect auditory cloak for the silent work happening three decks down. Miri adjusted
  her earpiece, watching Jax fumble with the magnetic decoupler near the ventilation
  grate.


  "Steady," she whispered, checking her reflection in a polished brass fixture—black
  gown, diamond earrings, looking more like a guest than a ghost. "You scratch the
  paint, Sorokin notices."


  Jax, a former pickpocket with more enthusiasm than grace, finally popped the grate.
  "Got it. And this thing works on the vault too?"


  "It works on anything ferromagnetic," Miri said, checking her watch. "Leo, loop
  the cameras."


  The party above was in full swing—champagne, caviar, and the distinct, expensive
  scent of old money. They moved through the narrow service corridors like oil through
  a piston. Miri felt the old rhythm return, the thrill of the restoration process
  in reverse. Instead of preserving art, she was liberating it.


  They reached the private gallery. The walls were hung with masters, but the floor
  was the problem—a pressure-sensitive grid. Miri reached into her clutch and pulled
  out a canister of fine, crushed glass. She sprinkled it across the threshold, the
  glittering debris confusing the sensors into reading a constant, static weight.


  "Walk where I walk," she commanded, stepping onto the glass. It crunched softly,
  louder than she liked, but the sensors remained green.


  They reached the target: a Renaissance masterpiece of a Madonna and child, its blue
  robes vibrant despite its dark history. Jax whistled. "Worth the risk?"


  "Every euro." Miri lifted the frame, triggering a silent alarm. She smirked; they
  had ten seconds before the secondary system pinged. "Jax, the decoupler. Now."


  Jax slapped the magnetic tool against the security frame. With a heavy *thunk*,
  the locking mechanism disengaged. Miri lifted the painting, sliding a protective
  sleeve over it. A rush of adrenaline hit her—pure, uncut victory. They had done
  the impossible.


  "Package secure," Leo buzzed in her ear. "Extraction in two. Head for the aft deck."


  Miri signaled Jax, but as she turned to leave, her eyes caught the security monitor
  mounted above the door. The feed showed the main control room. It wasn''t staffed
  by Sorokin''s usual thugs. Sitting at the console, swirling a glass of vodka with
  terrifying calmness, was Elena.


  Her former mentor. The woman who had forged the provenance documents that ruined
  Miri’s career, sending her from the pristine halls of the Louvre to the criminal
  underworld.


  Miri froze, the blood draining from her face. Elena wasn''t just here; she was running
  the grid.


  "Miriam?" Jax asked, sensing the shift in her posture. "We gotta move."


  "She knew," Miri whispered, the realization cold and sharp. "This wasn''t a job.
  It''s a trap."


  The playful confidence of the heist evaporated, replaced by the icy grip of memory.
  The roar of the race outside suddenly seemed distant. If Elena was here, the simple
  grab-and-turn was over. This was a vendetta.


  "Miri, the hallway sensors just went active," Leo said, panic rising in his voice.
  "It''s a lockdown. She''s sealed the lower deck. She''s herding you."


  Miri looked at the monitor. Elena was looking directly at the camera, a predator
  smiling at prey.


  Heavy blast doors slammed shut with finality, cutting off the exit. The lights shifted
  from soft gold to emergency red, bathing the gallery in a hellish glow.


  "Jax, get back!" Miri shouted, shoving him against the wall just as a turret deployed
  from the ceiling. It didn''t fire bullets; it fired a high-pressure sonic cannon
  that slammed into Jax, knocking him backward. He crumpled, gasping for air, clutching
  his head.


  "I can''t... I can''t move," Jax groaned, dazed.


  Elena’s voice, smooth and cultured, echoed through the hallway speakers. "You always
  were sloppy with your exits, Miri. You should have left the boy behind and taken
  the service hatch."


  Miri looked at the wall panel. The electronic lock was fried, sealed tight. The
  only way out was the heavy maintenance access door across the hall, but it was designed
  to withstand storms, not pry bars.


  She looked at the magnetic decoupler lying on the floor near Jax’s hand. It was
  a small tool, meant for vent covers, not blast doors. But the maintenance door had
  industrial steel hinges.


  "Jax, the decoupler! Toss it here!" Miri yelled over the siren.


  He weakly threw the tool. She caught it, slamming the powerful magnets against the
  hinge of the heavy door. The tool whined in protest, the magnetic field engaging.
  She pulled with all her strength, the metal groaning as the pins began to shear.


  "You have a choice, my dear," Elena purred, the sound of approaching boots echoing
  from the vent shaft. "Save the painting or save the thief?"


  Miri kicked the door open, revealing the dark ocean below and the waiting Zodiac.
  She looked at the painting resting against the wall, then at Jax, struggling to
  stand.


  "Sorry, Elena," Miri muttered, grabbing Jax by the collar and dragging him toward
  the exit. "I''m not a thief anymore. I''m a conservator. I save what''s broken."


  She left the painting on the floor and dove into the night.'
