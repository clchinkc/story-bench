output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  Marcus shook his head, the words hitting like a gut punch. "No, Denise. There isn''t.
  The fundraiser tanked—we barely scraped together enough for a month''s utilities.
  And the grant? I just got the email. Denied. Flat out. They said our program''s
  ''not viable'' anymore."


  Her face fell, but she pressed on. "What about the board? Or appealing to the council
  one last time?"


  "It''s over." He rubbed his temples, the headache pounding like a death knell. "The
  board''s already jumping ship. Half of them emailed their resignations this morning.
  And you... you were the one who tipped off the developer about our budget shortfall,
  weren''t you? To save your own job?"


  Denise''s eyes widened, then she looked away, guilt etching her features. "Marcus,
  I... I had to. My family''s depending on me. I''m sorry." She grabbed her bag and
  headed for the door, pausing only to mutter, "Good luck." The door clicked shut
  behind her, leaving the room echoing with silence.


  His phone buzzed. Not his wife this time—no supportive words, no pizza plans. Just
  a voicemail from her earlier that day, before the news broke: "I can''t keep pretending
  everything''s fine. The kids are suffering from all this stress. If the center goes,
  so does our marriage. Call me when you have a real plan." But there was no plan
  left. The youth program, his life''s work, was crumbling. One of the kids, little
  Jamal who''d finally opened up about his home life, would be back on the streets
  without this safe haven. It felt like death—losing the center meant losing them
  all, piece by piece.


  Marcus slumped into his chair, alone in the dimming light. Fifteen years, gone.
  No team, no family rallying, no miracles waiting. Just him, staring at the ruins
  of everything he''d built.'
