output: 'Miri adjusted her catering uniform, the polyester blend a far cry from the
  linen she''d worn at the Louvre. Through the Tsarina''s ballroom windows, she watched
  Formula One cars scream past Monaco''s harbor, each roar a perfect cover for the
  next phase. On her comms, Lena''s voice crackled: "Environmental system spoofed.
  You''re good for the swap."


  Leo, disguised as a technician, hovered near the Vermeer. His hands trembled as
  he unlatched the frame. "Relax," Miri murmured into her collar mic. "The Grand Prix
  is nature''s white noise machine."


  "Easy for you to say," Leo muttered. "My forgery''s good, but it''s not ''fool a
  Russian oligarch'' good."


  "Your color matching is flawless. Trust the chemistry." Miri watched as Marco, playing
  the drunk playboy, spilled champagne on a guard''s shoes near the exit. The diversion
  worked perfectly.


  The painting came free. Leo slid the replica into place with surgical precision.
  As he secured the latches, a voice behind him said, "Having trouble with that frame?"


  Miri''s blood froze. A guest—some hedge fund manager—squinted at Leo''s work badge.


  "Just adjusting the humidity controls," Leo said, his voice admirably steady. "This
  Vermeer is sensitive."


  The man nodded, already losing interest. "Carry on."


  Back in the service corridor, Miri exhaled. "Nice save."


  "Wasn''t a save," Leo said, wiping sweat from his brow. "He was three seconds from
  asking why a ''humidity controller'' has paint under his fingernails."


  Lena laughed over the comms. "That''s what you get for authenticity. Now get to
  the vault—Sorokin''s doing his big toast."


  They moved through the yacht''s bowels like ghosts. The vault was next. The real
  prize wasn''t the Vermeer—it was the Renaissance portrait hidden behind it in Sorokin''s
  private safe. The painting, a small devotional piece by a student of Titian, had
  been looted from the Rosenberg family in ''43. The family had the provenance. Sorokin
  had the lawyers.


  The swap went flawlessly. Lena''s hack made the security feed loop footage of an
  undisturbed vault. Leo''s replica slid into the hidden compartment. As they retreated
  to the service deck, Lena''s voice changed. "Miri. We''ve got a problem."


  "Define problem."


  "Sorokin just announced a surprise vault inspection. Ten minutes."


  Miri stopped. "He never does that. Not even during the race."


  "There''s more." Lena''s tone was grim. "The guard rotation pattern—it''s the Meridian
  Protocol."


  The name hit Miri like a fist. The Meridian Protocol. Her mentor''s signature, a
  system of rotating blind spots so elegant it was practically choreography. She''d
  helped design it, back when she believed in institutional security.


  "Eleanor''s here," Miri whispered.


  "Who''s Eleanor?" Leo asked, his face pale.


  "The woman who ruined my life." Miri''s mind raced. "Change of plan. We don''t just
  extract—we ghost. Now."


  But they were already moving. The environmental hack Lena had deployed—that clever
  bit of code that masked their air pressure signature when doors opened—suddenly
  blinked red on Lena''s tablet.


  "Backup system''s active," Lena hissed. "She installed a secondary grid. I''m locked
  out."


  Guards began moving with purpose, not the usual party-security languor. This was
  a coordinated sweep. Eleanor''s voice—smooth, familiar, devastating—came over the
  yacht''s PA system, though Miri knew it was meant for her: "Attention all staff.
  Security audit in progress. Please remain at your stations."


  "She knows," Leo said. "She''s talking to us."


  "She''s talking to me." Miri''s jaw clenched. "Lena, can you—"


  "Can''t move. I''m in the security closet. Guards are sweeping this deck."


  Miri looked at Leo. The painting was secure in its transport tube, ready for the
  underwater exit they''d planned. She could take it, dive off the stern, and be gone.
  The Amsterdam family would get their heirloom. Eleanor would have lost.


  But Lena would be caught. And Eleanor would have Miri''s entire crew.


  "How long until they reach you?" Miri asked Lena.


  "Ninety seconds."


  Leo grabbed Miri''s arm. "We can''t leave her. Eleanor will destroy her."


  The irony wasn''t lost on Miri. Her mentor had taught her that artifacts were replaceable,
  people weren''t. Then she''d framed Miri to save her own career.


  Miri made her choice. "Leo, take the painting. Use the maintenance shaft. It''ll
  trigger the pressure alarm, but I''ll be there to cause a bigger one."


  "What?"


  "Go!" Miri shoved the tube at him. "I''ll get Lena."


  As Leo disappeared into the crawlspace, Miri heard Eleanor''s voice again—this time
  directly, over their compromised comms. "Miriam. You always did care too much about
  the help."


  Miri smiled, though her heart hammered. "Eleanor. You always did underestimate how
  much the help could hurt you."


  She pulled the fire alarm. Every exterior door sealed automatically—except the maintenance
  shaft, which Leo had jammed open with a wrench from his toolkit. Alarms screamed.
  Guards ran. And somewhere in the chaos, Miri ran toward Lena, the past and present
  colliding in a perfect, dangerous storm. '
