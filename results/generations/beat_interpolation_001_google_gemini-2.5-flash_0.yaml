output: 'The chill of the morning had done little to thaw Elena’s resolve. She found
  herself outside Marcus’s Curiosity Shop, its bell jingling a reluctant invitation.
  Marcus, a man whose face was a roadmap of forgotten adventures, looked up from polishing
  a brass sextant. “Trouble, Elena? Or just admiring my collection of… well, curiosities?”


  Elena clutched her worn cardigan. “My grandmother’s map. It’s… insistent.” She explained,
  hesitantly, about the glowing runes and her ghost grandmother’s unwavering belief.
  Marcus listened, his gaze surprisingly sharp. “The Wellspring of Echoes,” he murmured,
  stroking his chin. “A place of profound knowledge. And danger.” He walked to a dusty
  shelf, pulling down a sturdy leather satchel and a tarnished brass compass. “You
  think you’re not a hero, eh? You think you’re just a librarian.” He chuckled, a
  sound like dry leaves rustling. “Who better to navigate ancient texts and hidden
  knowledge than someone who spends their life doing just that? The forest tests intentions,
  Elena, not brute strength. It tests what you know, not what you fear you lack.”


  He pressed the satchel and compass into her hands. “This satchel is lighter than
  it looks, and this compass… well, it points where you *need* to go, not where you
  expect.” Elena stared at the simple gifts, a flicker of something other than dread
  stirring within her. Perhaps, just perhaps, cataloging the world’s stories had given
  her more than just a dusty cough.'
