output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands.

  The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes, exactly
  as

  the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled, its voice echoing with cruel
  knowledge. "Stronger warriors have tried... and failed like your brother."


  The words struck like a physical blow. Her brother''s final scream, the memory she''d

  buried, flooded back. The guilt she''d carried—the knowledge that she could have
  saved

  him but chose flight instead—now burned in her chest alongside the dragon''s fire.


  "You left him to die," the Shadow Dragon hissed, reading her thoughts. "You ran
  while

  he faced me alone."


  Kira''s hands shook harder. The dragon was right. She had failed her brother, failed

  everyone who counted on her. What right did she have to stand here with a sword,

  pretending to be a hero?


  But as the creature prepared to strike again, something shifted. Her brother''s
  voice—

  forgiving, not accusing—whispered through her memory. He wouldn''t want her defined

  by guilt. He would want her to fight, to protect others as she couldn''t protect
  him.


  The battle was brutal. Flame scorched her armor. Claws raked across her shield.
  Three

  times she was knocked down, and three times she rose again. Each fall forced her
  to

  confront that moment of choice—flight or flight now meaning something different.


  When the dragon overextended on a strike, she saw not just an opening in its scales,

  but in herself. With the last of her strength, she drove her sword through the gap,

  piercing its heart and the guilt that had chained her.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,

  victorious but transformed. The weight in her chest had shifted—from guilt to

  understanding.


  "I did it," she whispered, and meant more than the dragon''s defeat. She had finally

  confronted her deepest fear and emerged reborn.'
