output: 'The morning sun filtered through the frost-laced windows of Elena''s small
  cottage, casting long shadows across the floor. She hadn''t slept much, her mind
  replaying the glowing map and her grandmother''s insistent ghost. Ordinary, she''d
  called herself—profoundly so. Yet here she was, pulling on her boots with a restlessness
  that felt anything but ordinary. She needed air, or answers, or maybe just a distraction
  from the pull she couldn''t quite shake.


  Wandering into the village square, Elena found herself drawn to the old curiosity
  shop on the corner, its sign creaking in the breeze: "Marcus''s Oddities and Antiquities."
  She''d passed it a hundred times, dismissing it as a dusty relic for dreamers. Today,
  though, she pushed open the door, the bell jingling like a reluctant invitation.


  Inside, shelves groaned under the weight of peculiar artifacts: crystal orbs that
  hummed faintly, leather-bound tomes with indecipherable scripts, and compasses that
  pointed to nowhere in particular. Behind the counter stood Marcus, a weathered man
  with a salt-and-pepper beard and eyes that sparkled like he''d seen too many horizons.
  He was a former adventurer, or so the village whispers went—someone who''d traded
  his sword for trinkets after one too many close calls.


  "Ah, Elena the librarian," he said, looking up from polishing a brass spyglass.
  "I''ve been expecting you. That map of yours has a way of stirring things up."


  She blinked, caught off guard. "How did you—"


  "Ghosts talk, and old maps louder still." He set the spyglass down and leaned forward,
  his voice steady and knowing. "You''re the one it chose. But you''re doubting yourself,
  aren''t you? Thinking you''re just a keeper of books, not a seeker of paths."


  Elena fidgeted with her sleeve, her self-deprecation bubbling up. "Because I am.
  What good is alphabetizing shelves against whatever lurks in Thornwood? I''m no
  fighter."


  Marcus chuckled softly, not mocking, but with a warmth that made her defenses waver.
  "Ah, but that''s where you''re wrong. Adventuring isn''t just swinging swords—it''s
  deciphering clues, piecing together forgotten lore. Your librarian''s eye for patterns,
  for hidden meanings in dusty pages? That''s a weapon sharper than any blade. The
  Wellspring tests the mind as much as the mettle. You see connections others miss;
  that''s what the map saw in you. Something resilient, even if you don''t believe
  it yet."


  He reached under the counter and pulled out a worn leather satchel, stuffing it
  with a few items: a vial of luminous ink, a notebook bound in what looked like dragon
  hide, and a brass compass etched with runes. "These aren''t magic fixes—just tools
  to help you trust what you already know. The compass follows intent, not roads.
  Use it wisely, and remember: the forest doesn''t care for heroes; it respects the
  persistent."


  Elena took the satchel, its weight surprisingly comforting. Her doubts didn''t vanish—they
  lingered like morning mist—but for the first time, they felt... surmountable. Maybe
  she wasn''t spectacularly ordinary after all. Maybe ordinary was enough, if she
  leaned into it. "I still think this is a mistake," she muttered, but her voice lacked
  its earlier bite.


  "Then prove it to yourself," Marcus said, his gaze steady. "But don''t linger. The
  path waits."


  She nodded, a reluctant resolve settling in her chest like a half-read book begging
  to be finished. Stepping back into the daylight, the satchel on her shoulder, Elena
  turned toward the distant treeline of Thornwood. The refusal of last night felt
  distant now, replaced by a tentative step forward.'
