  The manuscript trembled in Eleanor’s hands as she traced the jagged edges of the
  pages, the ink smudged where her father’s fingers had gripped them too tightly.
  *The Whitechapel Murders: A True Account.* The words slithered off the page like
  something alive. She knew what this was—not just a story, but a confession. A reckoning.
  And if it was true, if even half of it was true, then publishing it would either
  save Blackwood & Sons or bury it forever.


  Thomas shifted beside her, his breath visible in the damp air. “Your father believed
  the author was someone close to the killings. A witness. Maybe even…” He hesitated,
  glancing toward the iron gates of the cemetery. “Someone who knew the Ripper’s mind.”


  Eleanor’s throat tightened. “And you think this will sell?”


  “It will sell,” Thomas said, his voice low. “But not just because it’s sensational.
  Because it’s *true.* And because London is desperate for answers.” He stepped closer,
  his voice dropping further. “The creditors won’t wait, Miss Blackwood. But if we
  print this—if we print it *now*—we could pay them off before the month is out. The
  risk, though…” He didn’t finish. He didn’t have to.


  The risk was everything.


  Eleanor thought of her father’s hands, ink-stained and steady, pressing the plates
  for the *Times* when she was a girl. She thought of the way he’d let her sit in
  his office, pretending to read ledgers while she memorized the scent of paper and
  oil. *This is your legacy,* he’d told her once, though he’d never meant for her
  to claim it. Not like this.


  She looked up at Thomas, his dark eyes sharp with something she hadn’t seen before—not
  just loyalty, but urgency. “You’ve read it,” she said. It wasn’t a question.


  He nodded. “Every word. And I’ll stand beside you, whatever you decide.”


  The weight of the decision pressed down on her like the London fog, thick and suffocating.
  If she published this, she would be defying more than just creditors. She would
  be stepping into a world where women didn’t belong—not in print shops, not in the
  shadows of Whitechapel, not in the business of truth when it was this ugly. But
  if she didn’t…


  The printing house would collapse. Her father’s name would be forgotten. And the
  manuscript—this *thing*—would vanish into the dark, another secret swallowed by
  the city.


  Eleanor exhaled, her breath curling into the cold. “We print it.”


  Thomas didn’t smile. He didn’t celebrate. He only nodded, as if he’d known all along
  this was the only answer. “Then we start tonight. The presses won’t wait.”

  The Blackwood & Sons printing house loomed over them as they approached, its brick
  façade blackened by soot and time. The windows glowed faintly from the gaslights
  inside, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cobblestones. Eleanor’s boots
  clicked sharply against the pavement, each step a declaration. She was no longer
  a mourner. No longer a daughter. She was the owner now. The publisher.


  Thomas unlocked the door, the hinges groaning like a warning. Inside, the air smelled
  of ink and damp wood, the scent of her father’s life’s work. The presses stood silent,
  their massive arms poised like sleeping giants. Eleanor ran her fingers along the
  nearest one, the metal cold beneath her touch.


  “We’ll need to work quickly,” Thomas said, already moving toward the back room where
  the typesetting tables waited. “If word gets out before we’ve finished—”


  “It won’t,” Eleanor cut in. She turned to him, her voice steady. “No one else can
  know. Not the staff. Not the distributors. Not until the first copies are in the
  hands of the *Times*.”


  Thomas paused, his expression unreadable. “You understand what you’re asking. If
  this is traced back to us—”


  “I understand,” she said. “But we’re past the point of turning back.”


  She pulled the manuscript from her coat, the pages now creased from her grip. The
  first line stared up at her: *“The first murder was not the first killing.”* Her
  stomach twisted, but she forced herself to focus. This was business. This was survival.


  Thomas lit the lamps, their flickering light casting monstrous shapes across the
  walls. “I’ll set the type,” he said. “You handle the distribution list. We’ll need
  to move the copies ourselves—no middlemen.”


  Eleanor nodded, already reaching for the ledger where her father had kept his contacts.
  The names blurred before her eyes, but she forced herself to focus. The *Times.*
  The *Standard.* The smaller papers, the ones that thrived on scandal. And then—her
  pulse quickened—there were the private buyers. The ones who paid in cash, no questions
  asked.


  A floorboard creaked above them. Eleanor froze.


  Thomas’s hand shot out, gripping her wrist. “We’re not alone,” he whispered.


  The creaking came again, slower this time. Deliberate.


  Eleanor’s breath hitched. The manuscript felt suddenly heavier in her hands, as
  if the words themselves were pulling her down. She met Thomas’s gaze, and in that
  moment, she knew: there was no going back. Not now. Not ever.


  The presses would run. The truth would print. And whatever—or *whoever*—was waiting
  in the shadows above them would have to be faced.


  She tightened her grip on the manuscript.
