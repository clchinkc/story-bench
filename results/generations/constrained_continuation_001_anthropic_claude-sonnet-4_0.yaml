output: 'The hidden passage led them through catacombs older than the market above,
  bones jutting from walls like broken teeth. Tomás moved with surprising agility
  for a scholar, but Zara noticed how his breathing labored as they climbed deeper
  into the earth''s belly.


  "The Approach," he whispered as they emerged onto a narrow ledge overlooking a vast
  cavern. Below, ancient stone bridges spanned a chasm that disappeared into darkness.
  The air reeked of sulfur and something else—decay.


  "Those bridges are trapped," Zara said, studying the tilework. "Pressure plates.
  Classic thieves'' work, but old." She traced patterns only someone raised in the
  underground would recognize. "We can cross, but we''ll need to—"


  A wheeze escaped Tomás. Blood flecked his lips.


  Zara''s stomach dropped. "You''re sick."


  "The wasting sickness," he admitted. "Same as your mother. That''s why I need the
  Library''s texts." His eyes held desperate honesty. "I didn''t lie about knowing
  the route. But I can''t make this crossing alone."


  The sound of pursuit echoed from behind—scorpion cloaks in the tunnels. Zara could
  double back, find another way out. Save herself. The smart move, the survivor''s
  choice she''d made countless times in the capital''s alleys.


  Instead, she grabbed Tomás''s arm. "Stay close. Step exactly where I step."


  She led him across the first bridge, reading the stone like a map of danger. Here—safe.
  There—death. Her fingers found handholds her grandmother had taught her to spot,
  weight distributions that wouldn''t trigger the ancient mechanisms. Halfway across
  the second span, Tomás stumbled.


  The bridge section tilted. Stone ground against stone, and they were falling.


  Zara twisted, every instinct screaming as she caught the ledge''s edge. Her shoulder
  blazed with pain, but she held on, Tomás''s weight dragging from her other hand.
  Below them, darkness waited like an open mouth.


  "Let go," Tomás gasped. "Save yourself."


  Here it was—the moment she''d always feared. Not death, but failure. Watching someone
  else pay the price for her choices. Like her mother wasting away while Zara threw
  herself into impossible schemes instead of accepting the truth: some things couldn''t
  be stolen, couldn''t be solved with clever fingers and quick thinking.


  "Not happening," she grunted, and swung them both toward a narrow outcropping she''d
  glimpsed while falling.


  They crashed onto stone barely wide enough for two bodies. The impact drove breath
  from her lungs, and for a moment the world went black. When awareness returned,
  she was different—hollow, scoured clean. The fear that had driven her for years
  was gone, replaced by something harder and more fragile: determination without the
  safety net of self-preservation.


  "The Library entrance," Tomás wheezed, pointing to where carved symbols marked a
  doorway cut into the cavern wall.


  Zara helped him stand, her whole body aching. They''d crossed into something larger
  than their individual need. But as they approached the ancient entrance, torchlight
  flickered on the far side of the chasm. The Scorpion Guild had found another route,
  and they weren''t alone. Figures in different colors waited with them—other factions,
  drawn by word of the Library''s opening.


  The race had begun.'
