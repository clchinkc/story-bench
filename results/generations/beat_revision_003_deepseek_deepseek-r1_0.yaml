output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... transformative." Sophie felt the familiar vibration in her pocket. She
  pulled out her phone, scanning notifications. Three emergency flags from Linda.
  The Pearson account crisis. Her thumb hovered over the call button, knuckles whitening.


  Then she breathed. Deeply. As the monks had taught her. The panic dissolved like
  sugar in hot water. She silenced the phone, letting it rest face-down on her thigh.
  "I''ll handle it tomorrow morning. With fresh eyes."


  Her mother blinked. "Are you sure?"


  "Certain." Sophie watched raindrops trace paths on the window. "Some fires burn
  themselves out if you stop fanning them."


  They drove in silence. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through the evening
  haze. Sophie''s apartment building. The coffee shop. The same streets, yet now she
  noticed the way streetlights reflected on wet pavement like floating lanterns. How
  the city''s hum felt like breath rather than noise.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, and for the first time, she meant the stillness
  within her, not just the skyline.'
