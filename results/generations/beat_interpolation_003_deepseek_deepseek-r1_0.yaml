output: "Yuki moved through the deserted crew quarters, her scanner casting a pale\
  \ blue beam across overturned chairs and half-eaten meals. Personal logs flickered\
  \ on abandoned tablets—Commander Reyes’s final entry mentioned “phase-shift trials”\
  \ for the Kronin cure, her voice tight with excitement. But the air tasted metallic,\
  \ charged with an energy signature her scanner couldn’t classify. Residual quantum\
  \ fluctuations, perhaps? \n\nIn the medical bay, biobeds stood empty. Scans showed\
  \ no pathogens, yet the crew’s vitals had spiked erratically before flatlining into…\
  \ nothing. Not death. Absence. As she studied the anomaly, a chill prickled her\
  \ neck. Behind her, a figure shimmered like distorted glass—a humanoid shape flickering\
  \ in the corner of her vision. She spun, pulse racing, but found only sterile walls.\
  \ \"Hello?\" Silence answered, thicker now. \n\nThe corridor to Lab Seven hissed\
  \ shut, emergency bulkheads sealing after a power surge. Alarms blared as oxygen\
  \ vents sputtered acidic vapor—a coolant leak. Yuki slapped her respirator on, fingers\
  \ flying across the access panel. Rewiring the circuits with trembling hands, she\
  \ bypassed the lockdown, her mind racing through chemical interactions. The vapor\
  \ thinned just as another shimmer darted past, whispering words too fragmented to\
  \ grasp. \n\nLab Seven’s door yielded. Inside, equations covered whiteboards, detailing\
  \ dimensional bridging. Projections showed crew members phasing in and out of visibility.\
  \ Not ghosts. Test subjects. Sacrifices. The cure required crossing thresholds no\
  \ human should breach. Her scanner confirmed it: forty-seven life signs, impossibly\
  \ stretched across realities. They were here. Watching. Waiting. And she had to\
  \ reach the core."
