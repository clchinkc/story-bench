output: "Eleanor stared at the manuscript’s title, the ink bleeding like old wounds.\
  \ Whitechapel’s shadow stretched across London, whispering of slit throats and vanished\
  \ women. Publishing this wasn’t just controversial—it was dancing on graves. Yet\
  \ the creditors’ demands echoed louder than her dread. Three months. The printing\
  \ house, her father’s legacy, crumbling brick by brick. Thomas shifted beside her,\
  \ mist clinging to his coat. \"He believed it would sell thousands,\" he murmured.\
  \ \"Serialized, weekly. Enough to clear debts.\" His own future hung in the balance;\
  \ without Blackwood & Sons, he’d lose more than employment—his immigrant family’s\
  \ fragile respectability would shatter. \n\nProfit versus peril. The calculation\
  \ chilled her. Printing sensationalized accounts of the Ripper’s crimes felt like\
  \ trading blood for coin. Yet what choice remained? William was gone, society deemed\
  \ her unfit, and bankruptcy meant ruin. She traced her father’s pseudonym—Arthur\
  \ Quill—a ghost pleading for salvation. \"We publish,\" Eleanor declared, the words\
  \ slicing through the graveyard silence. A threshold crossed; no undoing this. Thomas\
  \ nodded, relief warring with unease. \"The first installment is ready. But Miss\
  \ Blackwood… the author claims inside knowledge. If he’s real, if he’s involved—\"\
  \ \n\n\"Then we tread carefully,\" she finished. Danger coiled in the manuscript’s\
  \ gaps, in the unnamed sources hinting at police incompetence or aristocratic complicity.\
  \ But hesitation meant death for the press. \n\nAt Blackwood & Sons, Eleanor claimed\
  \ her father’s oak desk, ignoring the foreman’s scoff. \"Women manage households,\
  \ not ledgers,\" he spat. She dismissed him by noon, hiring a sharp-eyed typesetter\
  \ recommended by Thomas. The shop floor buzzed with scandalized whispers, but Eleanor\
  \ silenced them with Quill’s pages. Proofs emerged, smelling of ink and risk. \"\
  The Whitechapel Murders: Chapter One\" promised grisly truths, veiled threats between\
  \ lines. \n\nThat evening, a brick shattered the office window. Wrapped in cheap\
  \ paper, a note: STOP OR JOIN THEM. Thomas paled, scanning the fog-drenched street.\
  \ \"They know.\" Eleanor lifted the brick, her hands steady. Fear was a luxury;\
  \ survival demanded defiance. She locked the doors, lit every lamp, and worked until\
  \ dawn. \n\nBy week’s end, bundles of the first serial awaited distribution. Eleanor\
  \ stood amidst the presses’ rhythmic thrum, the scent of paper thick as guilt. Outside,\
  \ London’s hunger for horror grew—and with it, the eyes watching Blackwood & Sons.\
  \ The path was set. Let the danger come; she’d meet it with ink and iron resolve."
