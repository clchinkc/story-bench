output: 'Dr. Samira Hassan had spent fifteen years building her reputation as one
  of the nation''s foremost virologists. Her laboratory at Metro General was her sanctuary,
  her team her family, and her work her purpose. She had navigated academic politics,
  funding droughts, and the quiet sexism of her field with the same methodical patience
  she applied to her research. Life was orderly. Predictable. Safe.


  Then Patient Zero arrived, and everything changed.


  The anomalous protein structure on her screen defied explanation. The virus shouldn''t
  exist—couldn''t exist—according to every model she''d studied. Her assistant Raj
  appeared at the door, concern etched on his young face. "The CDC is on line two.
  They want to know why we requested an emergency containment team."


  Samira hesitated. If she was wrong, her career was over. If she was right, they
  were all in danger. "Tell them we have a potential Level 4 outbreak."


  The next seventy-two hours blurred into a nightmare of sleepless work and mounting
  dread. The containment team arrived in their hazmat suits. The hospital transformed
  into a fortress of plastic sheeting and negative pressure rooms. More patients appeared—five,
  then twelve, then thirty—each presenting the same impossible symptoms. Samira ran
  test after test, watching the pathogen evolve faster than she could document it.
  Failed trials accumulated like accusations on her desk. The CDC demanded answers
  she couldn''t give. Raj brought her cold coffee and worried glances, and she barely
  noticed either.


  "We''re missing something," she told him at hour sixty, her voice hoarse. "It''s
  not mutating randomly. It''s adapting. Like it''s designed to."


  She pulled up Patient Zero''s file with trembling hands, searching for the detail
  she''d overlooked. The employer field stared back at her: Nexus Biotech. A company
  that had been quietly acquiring gene-editing patents for years. The realization
  crashed through her exhaustion like ice water.


  "Oh god. Someone made this."


  The confrontation came twelve hours before the quarantine was projected to fail.
  Nexus sent their lawyers, their PR specialists, a senator who happened to be in
  the area. They threatened lawsuits, defamation charges, the complete destruction
  of her career. They had resources she couldn''t match and connections she couldn''t
  fight. But Samira had spent those seventy-two sleepless hours doing more than studying
  the virus—she''d been developing its cure. And she had one move they hadn''t anticipated.


  She called a press conference.


  The hospital lobby became a battlefield of shouted questions and camera flashes.
  Nexus representatives denied everything in real-time, their statements scrolling
  across news tickers even as Samira spoke. She ignored them. She presented her evidence,
  her data, her proof of corporate negligence and engineered catastrophe. And then
  she played her final card: the cure formula, transmitted simultaneously to every
  major news outlet, medical journal, and open-source database in the world.


  "You can sue me into oblivion," she said, her voice steady despite her exhaustion,
  "but you can''t patent something that belongs to everyone."


  The cameras flashed. The lawyers sputtered. The cure began spreading faster than
  the virus ever had.


  Six weeks later, federal investigators descended on Nexus Biotech with warrants
  and subpoenas. The outbreak was contained, the death toll lower than anyone had
  dared hope. Dr. Samira Hassan found herself blacklisted from every major research
  institution in the country—too controversial, too dangerous, too willing to burn
  bridges for the sake of principle.


  She didn''t mind. She''d built her reputation over fifteen years. She''d sacrificed
  it in fifteen minutes. And sitting in her small apartment, reading letters of gratitude
  from survivors she''d never meet, she discovered that peace tasted sweeter than
  prestige ever had.'
