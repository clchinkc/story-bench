output: "The apartment was dark when Maya finally unlocked the door. She didn’t bother\
  \ with the lights. What was the point? The gallery had officially closed its doors\
  \ that morning, twenty years of her mother’s legacy reduced to “LEASE AVAILABLE”\
  \ signs.\n\nShe sank onto the floor by the window, still wearing her coat. The city\
  \ lights blurred through the glass—or maybe through her tears. She’d tried everything.\
  \ The crowdfunding had fallen short. The investors had walked. Even her brother\
  \ had finally stopped answering her calls.\n\nHer mother’s last painting hung on\
  \ the wall opposite, barely visible in the darkness. A woman walking toward an unseen\
  \ horizon. Maya remembered sitting in the hospice, holding her mother’s hand, promising\
  \ she’d keep the gallery alive. “It’s not about the art,” her mother had whispered.\
  \ “It’s about having a place where people can feel something real.”\n\nMaya had\
  \ failed that promise. Failed her mother. Failed herself. The gallery was gone;\
  \ her mother’s spirit felt irretrievably lost. \n\nShe pulled her knees to her chest\
  \ and let the silence swallow her whole. Outside, the city kept moving—cars, sirens,\
  \ life—but in here, time had stopped. The weight of everything she’d lost pressed\
  \ down on her chest, suffocating. There was nothing left to do. No calls to make.\
  \ No plans to execute. Just the shadows of her dreams, haunting her in the stillness.\n\
  \nTomorrow, she’d have to face the world again. But tonight, she allowed herself\
  \ to break, to mourn the life that could have been, and the mother who would never\
  \ see her dreams fulfilled. In that dark apartment, the echoes of loss felt like\
  \ a finality, and all that remained was her despair."
