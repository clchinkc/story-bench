output: 'Elena pushed through the brass bells hanging over Holloway''s Curiosities,
  seeking distraction from the glowing map that had haunted her dreams. The shop''s
  cramped aisles overflowed with dusty artifacts, dried herbs, and books in languages
  she couldn''t identify.


  "Couldn''t sleep either?" Marcus Holloway emerged from behind towers of leather-bound
  volumes, his graying beard split by a knowing smile. Elena had cataloged his donations
  to the library for years—always unusual texts, always perfectly preserved.


  "The map," she began, then stopped. How could she explain?


  "Ah." Marcus''s weathered hands moved to a high shelf, retrieving an ornate brass
  compass. "Your grandmother mentioned you might visit. She was quite the researcher
  in her day, you know. Spent months in my back room, cross-referencing folklore with
  historical accounts."


  Elena blinked. "Grandmother was a scholar?"


  "The best kind—methodical, persistent, never accepted surface explanations." Marcus
  set the compass on the counter beside a worn leather satchel. "Skills any good librarian
  would recognize."


  "But I don''t know anything about magic or adventure—"


  "Do you know how to trace primary sources? Verify contradictory accounts? Follow
  logical progressions through complex systems?" Marcus''s eyes twinkled. "Because
  that''s exactly what successful questing requires. The forest doesn''t care about
  sword work, Elena. It tests understanding."


  Elena lifted the compass, feeling its surprising weight. "I still don''t think—"


  "Think about it this way," Marcus interrupted gently, filling the satchel with small
  vials and wrapped bundles. "If someone brought you a damaged manuscript, would you
  refuse to try restoring it because you''d never seen that particular type of damage
  before?"


  Elena''s fingers tightened around the compass. "No. I''d research the problem."


  "Exactly." Marcus smiled. "The Thornwood is just another kind of manuscript that
  needs reading."'
