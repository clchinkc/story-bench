output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  "I don''t know." He rubbed his temples. The paper felt heavy, like lead. "There
  isn''t."


  "What about the fundraiser?" Denise pressed, her voice trembling. "We have the gala
  next week. If we raise enough—"


  "The venue canceled an hour ago, Denise. The developer bought the hotel chain. They
  refunded our deposit."


  "Oh." Denise looked down. "Well, there’s the grant application. We should hear back—"


  "Denied. This morning. It was contingent on a twenty-year lease."


  Silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating. The sounds of kids playing
  basketball in the gym—usually a source of joy—now sounded like ghosts haunting a
  graveyard.


  His phone buzzed. A text from his wife: *I can’t do this anymore, Marcus. You’re
  never here. I’m taking the kids to my mother’s.*


  The air left his lungs. He wasn''t just losing the building; the obsession with
  saving it had cost him the home he actually lived in.


  Denise was packing her bag. She wouldn''t meet his eyes. "I... I can''t work for
  free, Marcus. I have rent. The developer offered me a job at their new complex.
  I start Monday."


  She placed her keys on his desk. The clink of metal on wood was final.


  "I''m sorry," she whispered, and then she was gone.


  Marcus sat alone in the darkening office. No funding. No staff. No marriage. The
  center was just a hollow shell of brick and mortar, and he was the last rat on the
  sinking ship. There were no cards left to play.'
