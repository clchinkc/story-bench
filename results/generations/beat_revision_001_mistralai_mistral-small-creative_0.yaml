output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled, its voice like grinding stone.
  "Your brother knew this. He begged for mercy at the end."


  The words struck deeper than any claw. Kira’s breath caught—she saw it again: her
  brother’s face, pale and pleading as the dragon’s fire consumed him. *She hadn’t
  been there.* She’d been too late. The guilt coiled in her chest, tighter than any
  dragon’s grip.


  The dragon’s maw split into a grin. "You think vengeance will bring him back? You’re
  just another fool clinging to a corpse."


  Kira’s legs nearly gave out. The sword slipped in her grip. *What if it was true?*
  What if all this—her training, her rage—was just a hollow echo of failure?


  Then she saw it: the flicker of doubt in the dragon’s eyes. It *wanted* her to break.
  Wanted her to turn and run, just like she’d run from the village that night.


  "No," she whispered. The word steadied her. She raised her sword—not for her brother’s
  ghost, but for the truth she’d buried: *she wasn’t fighting to avenge him. She was
  fighting to stop being the girl who failed him.*


  The battle was brutal. Flame seared her armor. Claws split her shield. Three times
  she fell, and three times she rose—not because she was strong, but because she *chose*
  to. Each time, the dragon’s taunts grew desperate. "You’re weak! Just like him!"


  But Kira no longer heard the words. She heard the silence after her brother’s last
  breath. And this time, she answered it.


  When the dragon overextended, she didn’t strike for its heart. She struck for its
  throat—the voice that had poisoned her. The blade found its mark.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  her hands steady for the first time in years. The weight in her chest was gone.


  She didn’t whisper *I did it.* She said, *"I’m free."*


  Then she turned toward home—not to tell the others, but to finally lay her brother
  to rest.'
