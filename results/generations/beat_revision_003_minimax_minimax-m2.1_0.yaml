output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly." Sophie scrolled through her phone,
  checking the work emails that had piled up while she was away. Three emergencies.
  Linda needs me to call her tonight."


  "Can''t it wait until morning?"


  Sophie hesitated. In the past, she would have called Linda immediately, found a
  quiet spot in the airport, solved someone else''s crisis before she''d even collected
  her bags. The old Sophie would have been already typing.


  "It can wait," she said, and put the phone in her pocket.


  Her mother glanced over, surprised.


  They drove in silence for a while. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through
  the evening haze. Sophie''s apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought
  her morning latte. Everything exactly as she''d left it.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, and meant it in a way she hadn''t before—not
  just returning to routine, but choosing to hold onto something quieter that she''d
  found in those silent rooms. The emails would be there tomorrow. Some things, she''d
  learned, were more important.


  Life went on. But so, it seemed, did she.'
