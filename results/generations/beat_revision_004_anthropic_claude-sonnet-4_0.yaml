output: 'Detective Rachel Torres spread twelve-year-old case photos across her desk
  in the pre-dawn quiet of Riverside Precinct. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead
  as she studied crime scene angles from the Martinez murder, noting details other
  detectives had missed. Coffee steamed beside a stack of files marked "COLD."


  "You''re here early again." Detective James Oyelaran set his jacket on his chair,
  eyeing the scattered evidence photos. "The Martinez case?"


  "Something''s off about the blood spatter angle." Rachel tapped a photo with her
  pen. "Look at this trajectory."


  James leaned over her shoulder, studying the image. "You think the killer was shorter
  than we estimated?"


  "Or left-handed." She pulled up the original report on her computer. "Three years
  working together and you still act surprised when I''m here before sunrise."


  "Three years, and I still don''t know how you function on two hours of sleep." He
  glanced at the small cat carrier beside her desk, where an orange tabby watched
  them through the mesh. "Sherlock''s pulling another all-nighter too?"


  Rachel scratched the cat''s chin through the carrier opening. "Building maintenance
  is fumigating my apartment today. He''s better company than most cops anyway."


  The precinct began stirring to life around them—phones ringing, officers discussing
  overnight arrests, the coffee maker gurgling in the break room. October morning
  light filtered through the tall windows, illuminating dust motes above the maze
  of desks where Riverside''s mix of property crimes and domestic disputes would soon
  demand attention.


  James picked up one of the Martinez photos. "What made you pull this one out?"


  "The Williams case yesterday. Similar wounds, different weapon." Rachel aligned
  the photos side by side. "Could be nothing."


  "Or your instincts picking up something everyone else missed."


  It was Tuesday morning in October when everything changed.'
