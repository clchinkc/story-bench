output: 'Eleanor traced the manuscript''s title with a gloved finger, the ink still
  fresh enough to smudge. The pages smelled of her father''s pipe smoke and something
  else—something metallic and sharp. "A true account," she whispered. "How could Father
  possibly—"


  "He had sources," Thomas interrupted, his voice low. "A constable who drank at the
  Pig and Whistle. But Miss Blackwood, publishing this... it walks a line. The police
  haven''t released these details. If they discover—"


  "Then they discover a dead man''s folly." Eleanor''s voice hardened. She thought
  of the creditors, of the machines sitting silent, of the workers'' faces when she
  told them they''d no wages. "Three months, Thomas. We have three months."


  She made her decision before the fog swallowed the last mourner. "We publish. Under
  Father''s pseudonym—Gideon Crowe. If questioned, we claim ignorance. A final shipment
  from the deceased author." The lie tasted of ash, but her father''s grave was still
  fresh, and grief made for good cover.


  Thomas''s jaw tightened. "My parents depend on my wages. They work in the laundry
  on Whitechapel Road. If this brings trouble—"


  "Then we ensure it brings profit first." Eleanor met his gaze. For a decade, Thomas
  had been the invisible hand keeping Blackwood & Sons alive. Now she needed his loyalty,
  not his judgment. "Will you stand with me?"


  He hesitated, then nodded once. The deal was struck.


  The next morning, Eleanor walked through the printing house doors not as a visitor
  but as proprietor. The foreman, Mr. Higgins, opened his mouth to object—then saw
  her expression and closed it. She wore her father''s waistcoat beneath her mourning
  dress, a silent declaration.


  "Gideon Crowe''s serial begins Thursday," she announced to the compositors. "We
  need ten thousand copies of the first installment. Mr. Chen will oversee the layout."


  Whispers followed her through the machinery. A woman, giving orders. A sensationalist
  story, profiting from slaughter. She felt their judgment like needles but kept her
  spine straight.


  Thomas worked through the night, his fingers black with type. When she brought him
  tea at midnight, he showed her the galley proof. The first chapter described a body
  found in Buck''s Row—details no newspaper had dared print, the mutilations hinted
  at but never named.


  "This is what will save us," he said quietly. "And this is what will damn us."


  The first edition sold out by noon. A second run, then a third. Money began to trickle
  in—enough to pay the rent, then the paper suppliers. Success tasted bitter. Eleanor
  watched the crowds gather outside their Fleet Street window, clutching pennies for
  the next installment, their faces hungry for horror.


  Then the letter arrived. Plain paper, block letters: *STOP PROFITING FROM THE DEAD
  OR JOIN THEM.*


  Thomas found it pinned to the shop door, his face pale. "My mother saw a man watching
  the laundry yesterday. Just standing, watching."


  Eleanor took the letter, her hands steady despite the ice in her veins. The threat
  was real. The line was crossed. There was no returning to the quiet life of a proper
  Victorian daughter—only forward into the dark they''d conjured.


  "Print the next chapter," she said. "We''ll print them all." '
