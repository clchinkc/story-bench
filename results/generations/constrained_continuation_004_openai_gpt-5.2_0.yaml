output: 'The next morning the city felt scrubbed raw by rain, as if London wished
  to wash itself clean of rumour. Eleanor rode to Fleet Street with her father’s manuscript
  held tight beneath her cloak, the paper warming against her ribs like a guilty secret.


  Blackwood & Sons waited behind its soot-stained windows, the familiar signboard
  hanging at a weary angle. Inside, the air carried ink, metal, and damp wool. Men
  at the cases paused when she entered, their eyes flicking from her veil to her hands—hands
  bare, ungloved, not carrying a lunch basket but an inheritance.


  Mr. Pritchard, the foreman, cleared his throat. “Begging your pardon, miss. We weren’t
  expecting—”


  “You may expect me,” Eleanor said, hearing her own voice as if from a corridor.
  “This shop is mine.”


  A small rustle moved through the compositors. It was not quite defiance, not quite
  respect; it was the sound of an order of the world being nudged, and the world deciding
  whether to snap back.


  Thomas closed the door behind them and followed her toward her father’s office.
  The room had been shut since the funeral. When she turned the key, the lock protested,
  then yielded with a sigh. Dust lay on the blotter like grey snow. Her father’s coat
  still hung on its peg, a mute reminder of whose place she was taking.


  Eleanor set the manuscript on the desk and opened it again. “A true account,” she
  murmured, tasting the words. Sensational. Profitable. Poisonous.


  Thomas remained standing, hands clasped, his posture the disciplined kind he wore
  when customers mistook him for a clerk and spoke to him slowly, as if English were
  an act of charity. “He thought it would sell,” he said. “Serials do. And the public…
  they are hungry for certainty in frightening times.”


  “Hungry,” Eleanor repeated. “For blood, you mean.”


  “I mean for an ending,” Thomas said quietly. “And for names. The constables won’t
  give them that.”


  Eleanor’s gaze slid over her father’s shelves: ledgers, proofs, envelopes tied with
  string. “If we print it, we profit from terror. We put women’s fear into penny packets.”


  “And if we don’t,” Thomas said, “the creditors seize the presses. Everyone here
  loses their wages. My mother and father will have nothing. You will have nothing
  but a grave and a surname.” His jaw tightened, not pleading but stating a fact London
  had always been ready to enforce.


  Eleanor sat, feeling the chair accept her as if it had waited. “What is in it that
  Father believed so strongly?”


  Thomas hesitated, then drew a smaller sheaf from his own coat—notes in a neat hand,
  ink browned with age. “Sources,” he said. “Your father spoke with a man at the mortuary
  office, a constable who owed him a favour. He gathered details that were never printed.”


  Eleanor’s stomach turned. “Details that should not be printed.”


  Thomas’s eyes met hers, steady and unromantic. “Details that another paper would
  print without conscience. At least here we can choose what to omit. We can avoid
  the vulgarity of it.” He tapped the manuscript. “But the bones of the story—how
  the police fumble, how the poor are left to lock their doors and pray—that may be
  worth saying.”


  A knock came at the office door before Eleanor could answer. Pritchard leaned in,
  cap in hand. “The gentlemen from Holborn,” he announced, as if naming a plague.
  “They’ve brought documents.”


  Eleanor stood. Her skirts whispered against the floorboards as she crossed to the
  outer room. Three men waited near the presses, their coats glossy with rain, their
  expressions dry. They did not remove their hats.


  “Miss Blackwood,” said the tallest, a smile as thin as a paper cut. “Our condolences.
  And our patience, which is not inexhaustible.”


  They spoke of numbers and interest and deadlines. Eleanor listened, her face composed,
  while behind their words she heard the clatter of the shop—the heart of the place
  ticking down.


  When they finished, she did not ask Thomas to answer for her. She did not retreat
  into the script women were handed with their mourning clothes. She lifted her chin.
  “Blackwood & Sons will continue operations,” she said. “We will publish a new serial
  beginning within the fortnight. Payment to creditors will be renegotiated on the
  strength of its receipts.”


  The men exchanged glances. “A lady proposes to save a printing house with a penny
  dreadful?” one said, amusement curdling his tone.


  “With a serial,” Eleanor corrected, coldly. “And a contract.” She looked to Thomas.
  “Bring me the paper estimate. And speak to the newsboys; I want distribution beyond
  Fleet Street.”


  Thomas’s mouth tightened at the corner—not a smile, but something like pride disciplined
  into obedience. “Yes, Miss Blackwood.”


  After the creditors left, laughter muffled behind their departing umbrellas, Eleanor
  returned to the office and shut the door. The manuscript lay where she had left
  it, its title staring up at her like an accusation.


  She dipped her father’s pen into ink. The black pooled, gleaming, as if eager.


  “There will be consequences,” Thomas said, voice low. “If the author’s sources are
  exposed, the police will be angered. If the wrong person reads it, they may take
  it as a challenge. And if the neighbourhood believes we are making coin from their
  misery—”


  “Then we will be careful,” Eleanor said. Her hand trembled once, then steadied.
  “And we will be honest where we can be. But we will print.” She began to write her
  signature at the bottom of the first proof order, the ink biting into the paper.
  “I will not let this place die quietly because propriety demands my silence.”


  Outside, the presses thumped on, indifferent as fate. Somewhere beyond the fog,
  Whitechapel kept its frightened watch. Eleanor blotted the page, rose, and carried
  the signed order into the composing room herself.


  “Set the first instalment,” she told them, and the shop seemed to inhale.


  As the men bent to their type and the letters fell into place—cold, leaden, irreversible—Eleanor
  felt the threshold close behind her with the soft finality of a door in a tomb.'
