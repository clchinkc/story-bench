output: "Yuki pushed into the Crew Quarters, her boots thudding against the metal\
  \ grate. The silence was punctuated by the rhythmic, wet throb of the station’s\
  \ cooling system. In Commander Reyes’s cabin, a half-eaten meal sat on the desk,\
  \ now a desiccated ruin. More unsettling were the distortions. As Yuki scanned the\
  \ room, the air rippled like oil on water. A shadow—humanoid and elongated—stretched\
  \ across the bulkhead, yet there was no one behind her to cast it. When she turned,\
  \ it vanished with a sound like tearing silk.\n\n\"Focus,\" she whispered, her pulse\
  \ thumping in her throat. Her scanner spiked with exotic particles—non-baryonic\
  \ matter bleeding into the local space-time. The crew hadn't left; the environment\
  \ itself was changing.\n\nShe moved toward the Medical Bay, but the heavy blast\
  \ door was dead-locked. A security override had been triggered from the inside,\
  \ the terminal screen glowing with a jagged \"ACCESS DENIED\" in crimson text. To\
  \ bypass it, she had to vent the localized gravity in the corridor, a risky maneuver\
  \ that sent her floating into the dark. Clinging to the wall-rails, she re-wired\
  \ the door’s internal logic board with her multitool, her breath fogging inside\
  \ her suit as the temperature plummeted. With a groan of protesting metal, the door\
  \ cycled open.\n\nInside the bay, vials of the Kronin’s serum were shattered, but\
  \ the spills didn't pool on the floor; they drifted upward in crystalline fractals,\
  \ defying physics. A silhouette flickered near the centrifuge—a man, she thought—his\
  \ face a blur of shifting geometries. He lunged toward her with impossible speed,\
  \ a hand reaching out that felt like a freezing wind passing through her chest.\
  \ Yuki dove aside, her shoulder slamming into a diagnostic bed. \n\nIt wasn't a\
  \ deliberate attack, she realized, watching the shimmer retreat into the vents.\
  \ It was a collision of dimensions. The crew were phased out, stuck in the threshold\
  \ of the breakthrough. Clinging to her mission, she tracked the highest concentration\
  \ of quantum leakage. The readings were off the charts, leading her toward the high-security\
  \ research wing. Lab Seven was just ahead, the epicenter of the distortion."
