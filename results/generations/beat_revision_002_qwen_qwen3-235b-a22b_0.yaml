output: "Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate\
  \ the community center where he'd run his youth program for fifteen years. The property\
  \ developer had won. The city council had sold out.  \n\n\"There has to be something\
  \ we can do,\" said Denise, his assistant director.  \n\n\"I don't know.\" He rubbed\
  \ his temples, staring at the grant rejection email on his phone. \"The fundraiser\
  \ money’s still two months short. Even if we maxed out the donations, it wouldn’t\
  \ cover a week’s rent elsewhere.\"  \n\nDenise bit her lip. \"I talked to Councilwoman\
  \ Ruiz again. She said—*off the record*—there’s no appeal. She called the developer’s\
  \ offer 'too lucrative to refuse.'\" Her voice cracked. \"I’m sorry, Marcus. I thought\
  \ if I pushed harder...\"  \n\nHis finger hovered over a photo in his desk frame—his\
  \ son at ten, grinning mid-handstand in the center’s gym. This building had been\
  \ the boy’s second home until the accident. Now both were gone.  \n\nA notification\
  \ buzzed. The grant denial. Final.  \n\nHe closed his eyes. The walls felt thinner,\
  \ already empty without the kids’ laughter. \"You ever notice how rotunda ceilings\
  \ look like coffins?\" He laughed bitterly, gesturing to the vaulted ceiling. \"\
  Grand, but hollow.\"  \n\nDenise stood, her chair screeching. \"Marcus, don’t. We’ll—\"\
  \  \n\n\"The hell we will.\" He shoved papers into a trash bin. \"You think I didn’t\
  \ see the emails? You’ve been job hunting since February. Tell me, Denise—when were\
  \ you planning to mention the center’s just a résumé booster?\"  \n\nShe flinched.\
  \ \"That’s not—!\"  \n\n\"Save it.\" He turned toward the gym. Toward where the\
  \ boys’ gymnastics mats still held phantom chalk marks. Toward where his son had\
  \ last hugged him.  \n\nDenise left, her footsteps echoing.  \n\nMarcus slumped\
  \ into the chair, cold metal pressing into his spine. Outside, a developer’s truck\
  \ idled, surveying the lot.  \n\nAlone."
