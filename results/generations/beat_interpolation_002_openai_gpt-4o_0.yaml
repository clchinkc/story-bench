output: "Sarah sat on her couch, the photo of Amy on the coffee table, glaring at\
  \ her like an accusation. She considered the simplest option: recanting her testimony.\
  \ It would mean safety for Amy, but the thought of letting Vincent Marchetti walk\
  \ free roiled her stomach. Her integrity, her commitment to justice—what were they\
  \ worth if it cost her sister’s life?\n\nThe other option was to report the threat,\
  \ lean on the system she’d trusted for years. She’d seen it work, but she’d also\
  \ seen its failures. The department was compromised, riddled with Marchetti’s influence.\
  \ Informing them might endanger Amy further, alerting those on the inside who could\
  \ tip off the family.\n\nTorn, she called Marcus Webb, her partner. He arrived quickly,\
  \ concern etched across his face. \"Sarah, you don't have to do this alone. We can\
  \ go to Morrison, get protection for Amy.\"\n\nShe shook her head, voice heavy with\
  \ doubt. \"You know how deep Marchetti's reach is. Even if we get Amy into protective\
  \ custody, who's to say someone won't betray us? They got to her once; they could\
  \ do it again.\"\n\nMarcus leaned forward, earnest. \"Then let's fight this together,\
  \ through the right channels. We have to believe in what we stand for.\"\n\nHis\
  \ words echoed what she’d always believed, but the stakes had changed. The system\
  \ wasn’t equipped for this kind of battle. Not when the enemy was embedded within\
  \ its own ranks. Her mind churned, weighing Marcus's offer against the raw truth\
  \ of her situation. \n\nIn the silence that followed, a memory surfaced—her father’s\
  \ voice from years ago, teaching her to play chess. \"Sometimes,\" he'd said, \"\
  the only way to win is to change the game.\"\n\nThat was it. The realization hit\
  \ her like a lightning bolt. She couldn’t play by the rules anymore. If she did,\
  \ she’d lose Amy and the case. But outside those confines, she could strike where\
  \ Marchetti wouldn’t expect. It was risky, dangerous, but it was a plan she could\
  \ control.\n\n\"Thank you, Marcus,\" she said, her voice firm now. \"But I need\
  \ to do this my way.\"\n\nAs he left, she knew she’d chosen her path. It wouldn’t\
  \ be easy, but it was the only way to save Amy and see justice done. The only way\
  \ to change the game."
