output: 'The fog swallowed them as they left the cemetery and trailed the omnibus
  toward Holborn, manuscript clutched to Eleanor’s chest like a living thing. Blackwood
  & Sons loomed out of the gloom: a narrow brick edifice with broken cornices and
  a brass plate that had not been polished since spring. Inside, the presses sat like
  sleeping beasts under tarpaulins, the air still pungent with ink and oil. On her
  father’s desk—her desk now—a ledger lay open to a column of figures that marched
  like funeral pallbearers.


  Thomas lit the gas, his face thrown into chiaroscuro. “You should know what it says
  before you decide,” he murmured. He gestured to the manuscript. “It names men. It
  speaks of alleyways, of a pattern in the nights, of the letters the police won’t
  own. If we print this, Miss Blackwood, we invite libel, and worse. But it would
  sell.”


  Eleanor sat and began to read, the pages rasping beneath her fingers. The prose
  was not lurid; it had her father’s steadiness, and a reporter’s eye. There were
  sketches in the margins—lantern circles, a map of Dorset Street, a hand noting timepieces
  that had stopped the same hour. There were quotes from witnesses no one had bothered
  to interview—laundresses, flower-sellers, women with their names kept off respectable
  lips. And there, in her father’s cramped hand, a note like a spur: “This city is
  an accomplice if it looks away.”


  Her throat tightened. “He was writing against forgetting,” she said.


  “And against men who can afford lawyers,” Thomas added. He stood at the window,
  peering into the wet street where a constable’s lantern bobbed. “The creditors won’t
  wait, but we can chase safer work. Almanacs for the New Year. Hymnals for St. Paul’s.
  Government circulars, if we can curry a clerk. This—this will put me and my family
  in the papers in the worst way. You know how they talk, Miss Blackwood.”


  She did know. Where her father had been praised for pluck, Thomas had been called
  fortunate, tolerated. The pressmen owed him their wages; his parents’ tea shop owed
  him its rent. His stake was written in the same ledgers as hers.


  “It will put me there as well,” she said. “A woman presuming to shout into the street.
  The scandal will do its rounds.”


  “And yet,” he said softly, “the first installment alone could pay the month’s coal.”


  Profit tugged at one sleeve, ethics and peril at the other. Eleanor heard her aunt’s
  voice—respectability, deportment, the safe parlor—and beneath it, the rasp of Whitechapel
  cobbles under her boots when she was foolish and fifteen, and had followed her father
  on his rounds. The women who had smiled at him had looked through her as if she
  might yet become useful.


  She set the pages down and looked at the room: the compositor’s frame, the inkballs,
  the type laid in neat coffins. There had always been a Blackwood at the helm. If
  she yielded the wheel now, she would prove every whisper right.


  “We publish,” she said.


  Thomas’s breath left him in a small cloud. “Under Mr. Penhaligon’s name?”


  “For now. But I’ll stand behind it with mine when it matters.” She squared the manuscript.
  “Not as spectacle. We remove anything that titillates. We print the failures of
  the watch, the poverty that makes women prey, the names of those who could have
  helped and did not. If we must profit, let it be in exchange for light.”


  “That is not how Fleet Street counts its pennies,” he said. But she saw in him,
  then, a flicker of pride. “You will be the first woman most of these men take orders
  from.”


  “Then let us teach them their letters again,” she replied.


  Before dawn they woke the beasts. The pressroom filled with men shrugging on coats,
  their faces nicked by years of work, their doubt palpable. Eleanor mounted the iron
  stair and spoke so her voice resounded against the rafters. “Blackwood & Sons remains
  open. Your pay depends upon our courage as much as your skill. We begin a serial
  today. Mr. Chen will oversee the formes. If any man thinks a woman cannot direct
  him, the door is that way—and the street is colder than this room.”


  No one moved. Somewhere a chuckle tugged a corner of the room; a few caps tipped.
  Thomas’s eyes met hers, steady as a rule.


  By noon she had signed her name where her father’s had been. The newsagents’ contracts
  lay like a row of guillotines; if Blackwood & Sons failed to deliver each week,
  penalties would cut into bone. She brought out the last sovereigns in the safe;
  she pledged the stereos of their schoolbook plates as collateral for fresh ink.
  Her signature looked small beneath the solicitor’s flourish, but it was indelible.


  The hint of a new world arrived with the first visitor: a boy with a cap too large
  for his head and a note pressed flat in his palm. “Left this at the door,” he muttered,
  eyes skittering from Eleanor to Thomas and back.


  The paper smelled faintly of ammonia, the letters formed with a precise, almost
  dainty hand. Leave Whitechapel to its own darkness. Stop the account, or a Blackwood
  will join it. Do not imagine that a woman’s hand makes you safe.


  Thomas folded it once, twice. “It could be a cruel jest.”


  “It could be proof we have struck a live wire,” Eleanor said. Her hatpin glittered
  on the desk like a thin blade. She slid the note beneath the ledger. “Lock the doors.
  Send the runners to the agents. We go to press.”


  The formes clattered into place. Ink smeared her cuffs to mourning grey. When the
  flywheel turned and the first sheets kissed the type, the press shuddered and roared,
  and something in Eleanor roared with it. Bundles went to boys with red faces and
  thin shoes. Gaslight caught the black letters—The Whitechapel Murders: A True Account—and
  carried them into the fog.


  There was no recalling a word once set and sent. The city would answer. Eleanor
  Blackwood had crossed.'
