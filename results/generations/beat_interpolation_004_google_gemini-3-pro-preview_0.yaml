output: 'Thomas approached the podium, the wood cool under his sweating palms. He
  didn''t look at his notes; he looked only at Patricia Okonkwo.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," Thomas began, his voice echoing in the vaulted room. "Please identify
  Exhibit C for the record."


  Patricia touched the document, her fingers trembling. She glanced toward the defense
  table, where the CEO gave a nearly imperceptible nod. She swallowed hard, her voice
  barely audible. "This is... a draft. An early internal memo. It contains errors
  I later corrected."


  A murmur rippled through the gallery. The lie hung in the air, thick and suffocating.
  The defense attorney leaned back, satisfied. She was doing it. She was burying the
  truth to save her child.


  Thomas felt a cold weight in his chest. He could impeach her, attack her credibility
  with the falsified dates, but that would only destroy the witness, not win the case.
  He needed her conscience, not just her compliance. He stepped out from behind the
  podium, ignoring the judge’s raised eyebrow, and closed the distance between them.


  "Errors?" Thomas asked softly. "Dr. Okonkwo, the ''error'' in that report corresponds
  to the cardiac arrest of patient fourteen. A nineteen-year-old boy."


  "I..." Patricia’s eyes darted around the room, panic rising. "Interpretations of
  the data can differ, Mr. Wright."


  "This isn''t about interpretation. It''s about safety." Thomas stopped at the railing
  of the witness box. He had to cut through the leverage Meridian held over her. He
  had to make her see that the bribe was poison. "You are a scientist. You are a healer.
  And you are a mother."


  "Objection!" The defense attorney shot up. "Relevance?"


  "Goes to the witness''s state of mind regarding the drug''s safety," Thomas fired
  back, not breaking eye contact with Patricia.


  The judge hesitated, glancing between them. "Overruled. Proceed with caution."


  Thomas leaned in, lowering his voice so it felt like just the two of them. "You
  know the risks better than anyone. If this drug is approved today, it will be prescribed
  to thousands. To the elderly. To teenagers. To children." He let the word hang there,
  heavy with implication. "Knowing what you know—knowing the data in that report is
  accurate—would you let your own daughter take it?"


  The courtroom froze. Patricia’s gaze snapped to the CEO, whose smile had vanished.
  She looked back at Thomas, her face crumbling as the terrible logic took hold. If
  the drug was a lie, the cure they offered her was a lie too.


  She straightened her spine, a tear tracking through her makeup.


  "No," she whispered. Then, her voice gained the strength of steel. "No. I wouldn''t.
  The report is accurate. The trials were rigged. The drug is lethal."'
