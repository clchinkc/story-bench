output: 'Eleanor read the first page by lamplight in her father''s office, Thomas
  standing silent beside the bookshelf. The manuscript was not sensationalist drivel.
  It was worse. Her father had somehow obtained information—details about the victims,
  timelines, possible suspects—that went far beyond what the newspapers reported.
  He claimed to have corresponded with someone close to the investigation.


  "Where did he get this information?" she asked.


  Thomas shifted uncomfortably. "I don''t know. He kept his sources confidential,
  even from me. But Miss Blackwood, if we publish this..." He paused. "The creditors
  would be paid within a month. I''ve calculated the figures. The public''s appetite
  for anything related to these crimes is insatiable. We could print ten thousand
  copies and sell them in a week."


  "And then?" She set down the pages. "We profit from women''s murders?"


  "We survive." Thomas''s voice carried an edge she''d never heard before. "My family
  depends on the wages from this printing house. As do twelve other families. Your
  father believed this story needed to be told—perhaps to help catch the killer. The
  police have failed. Maybe public scrutiny—"


  "You don''t believe that." Eleanor met his eyes. "You''re a practical man, Mr. Chen.
  This is about money."


  "Yes." He didn''t flinch. "It is. I won''t lie to you as men lied to your father
  about the company''s finances. We are drowning. This manuscript is the only rope
  within reach."


  Eleanor walked to the window. Below, the printing press sat idle—a hulking beast
  of iron and wood that had been her childhood playground. Her father used to lift
  her onto its platform, let her touch the metal letters, smell the ink. He''d published
  parliamentary proceedings, scientific journals, respectable novels. Never scandal.
  Never blood.


  But he''d kept this manuscript. He''d written it.


  She thought of the women in Whitechapel. They deserved justice, not exploitation.
  Yet without the printing house, what did she have? No husband would claim a penniless
  woman of twenty-six. No respectable employment would accept her. She would become
  what those murdered women had been: invisible, desperate, discarded.


  "If we do this," Eleanor said slowly, "we do it properly. No fabrications. We verify
  every claim we can." She turned to Thomas. "And we donate a portion of the profits
  to the victims'' families."


  "The creditors won''t wait for charitable deductions."


  "Then they''ll receive slightly less, slightly later." She lifted her chin. "Those
  are my terms, Mr. Chen. If your family''s welfare depends on this company, then
  you have as much stake in this decision as I do. Are we partners in this, or not?"


  Something shifted in Thomas''s expression—surprise, perhaps, or a careful reassessment.
  "Partners," he said. "Though the publishing world won''t receive a woman proprietor
  kindly."


  "Then we won''t announce my position. Not yet." Eleanor picked up the manuscript
  again. Her hands trembled slightly, but her voice remained steady. "You''ll attend
  the creditors'' meeting as acting manager. We''ll prepare the first printing immediately."


  "Miss Blackwood, you should know—there''s a note in your father''s papers. He believed
  the author of his source letters might be connected to the murders themselves. Not
  the killer, but someone close. Someone who knew things they shouldn''t."


  The room seemed to grow colder. Eleanor thought of her father, working late nights
  on this manuscript in the weeks before his sudden heart failure. Had it been sudden?
  Or had someone ensured his silence?


  She was stepping off a cliff, and there would be no climbing back.


  "Then we''ll be careful," she said. "Print the first installment."'
