output: 'Sarah stared at the phone for twenty minutes after the line went dead, her
  mind cycling through possibilities like evidence in a case file. The simplest solution
  sat right there: call the prosecutor, claim she''d been mistaken about the shooting,
  watch Marchetti walk free. Amy lives. Justice dies. Her fourteen-year career reduced
  to a lie.


  She pulled up Detective Marcus Webb''s contact. Her partner would know what to do—Marcus
  always knew what to do. The phone rang twice.


  "Chen? It''s past midnight. Everything okay?"


  "I need help." The words tumbled out: the photograph, the voice, the ultimatum.
  Marcus listened without interruption, his breathing steady on the other end.


  "We''ll put a protection detail on Amy immediately," he said. "Wire surveillance,
  full court press on the Marchetti organization. We''ve got seventy-two hours to—"


  "Marcus." Sarah closed her eyes. "How many people in the department knew I''d be
  testifying Monday?"


  Silence stretched between them. They both knew the answer. The Marchetti family
  had survived thirty years of prosecutions by having eyes and ears everywhere. Protection
  details could be compromised. Evidence could disappear. Witnesses could have accidents.


  "There has to be another way," Marcus said finally, but his voice carried no conviction.


  Sarah thought about Amy laughing at their mother''s birthday dinner last month,
  flour in her hair from baking the cake. Amy, who taught second grade and rescued
  stray cats and had never hurt anyone in her life. Amy, who would die because Sarah
  had chosen to be a cop, to testify, to believe the system could deliver justice.


  "If we go through channels, they''ll know every move we make," Sarah said. "If I
  recant, Marchetti walks and kills again. And if I do nothing..." She touched the
  photograph lying on her kitchen table.


  "So what are you thinking?"


  Sarah was already pulling case files from her laptop bag, spreading them across
  the table. Four years of investigating the Marchetti family. Every contact, every
  weakness, every favor owed. "I''m thinking there might be a third option."'
