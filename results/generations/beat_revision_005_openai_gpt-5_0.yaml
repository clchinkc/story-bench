  This segment cleanly hits the Dark Night of the Soul: it follows the All Is Lost
  (the gallery’s closure), isolates Maya in a dark apartment, and shows genuine despair
  and guilt tied to her mother’s dying wish. There’s a clear “whiff of death” through
  the hospice memory and the finality of the gallery’s end. No solutions intrude;
  the line about “tomorrow” preserves the wallow while keeping the scene focused on
  surrender and vulnerability.'
