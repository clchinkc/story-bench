output: 'Thomas stood. The air in the courtroom was thick enough to choke on. “Dr.
  Okonkwo,” he began, his voice steady despite the tremor in his hands. “You were
  the head of research for the Astra-12 trial, correct?”


  “Yes.” Her voice was a whisper. The microphone picked it up, a ghost in the room.


  For ten minutes, he walked her through the technicalities—the protocol, the oversight
  committee. She answered mechanically, her gaze fixed on her lap. The defense attorney
  looked bored, confident.


  Thomas approached the bench, placing himself directly in her line of sight. “Dr.
  Okonkwo, did you ever personally witness data from the Astra-12 trial being altered?”


  She looked at him, then past him, to where the CEO sat. Her throat worked. “The
  data… the reports were complex. Sometimes interpretations could vary.”


  It was the first step off the cliff. A prelude to recantation. Thomas felt the case
  slipping. He could see the defense attorney straighten, a shark scenting blood.


  “Let’s be specific,” Thomas pressed, his heart hammering. He held up a document.
  “This is the safety report you authored on July twelfth. It lists twelve severe
  adverse events. The report filed with the FDA lists two. Did you authorize that
  change?”


  Her eyes filled with tears. She opened her mouth, closed it. The courtroom held
  its breath. She was going to deny it. She was going to save her daughter and bury
  the truth.


  Thomas did the only thing he could. He abandoned his script. He stepped closer,
  his voice dropping, speaking only to her. “Patricia,” he said, the first name a
  violation of protocol, a personal plea. “Your daughter. She’s eight years old. What
  do you tell her about what you do?”


  The unexpected question shattered her composure. A sob escaped. “I… I tell her I
  try to help people.”


  “When she’s older,” Thomas whispered, the words fierce and urgent, “and she asks
  you about this day, about these seventeen people… what will you tell her you did?”


  It was a brutal gambit. He saw the impact strike home—not as a lawyer’s tactic,
  but as a father’s nightmare. Her face crumpled, then hardened into something resolute.
  She looked at Thomas, then directly at the jury, her voice clear and ringing.


  “I did not authorize the change,” she declared. “I was ordered to bury that report.
  The people at Meridian knew. They knew the risks, and they covered them up. For
  money.” She pointed a shaking finger at the CEO. “He knew.”


  The gallery erupted in noise. The judge’s gavel cracked like a gunshot. But the
  turning point had come and gone. The truth, finally, was in the room.'
