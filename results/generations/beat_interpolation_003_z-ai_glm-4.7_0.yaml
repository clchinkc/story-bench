output: 'Yuki swept her scanner through the Crew Quarters, the device chirping uselessly
  against the heavy silence. Beds were unmade, tablets left open on desks with unread
  messages. A half-finished game of solitaire on a screen suggested departure had
  been instantaneous, not gradual. There were no signs of violence, no blood—just
  a sudden, terrifying absence.


  She moved deeper toward the Mess Hall, her boots squeaking on the deck. The air
  grew perceptibly colder, unnatural for a functioning life-support system. Shadows
  elongated across the bulkheads, distorting into jagged shapes that didn''t match
  the room''s geometry. Suddenly, a figure coalesced near the galley—translucent,
  its edges blurring into the static of the air. Yuki raised her flashlight, but the
  beam passed through it as if it were smoke.


  "Identify yourself," she commanded, though her voice wavered. The figure didn''t
  speak; it merely drifted closer, radiating a low-frequency hum that vibrated in
  her teeth. Panic clawed at her throat, but Yuki forced herself to analyze the data.
  Her scanner readings were erratic—quantum fluctuations, not biological signatures.
  It defied physics.


  She backed away, retreating toward the sealed blast doors of the Science Wing. The
  figure was joined by another, then another, closing in like silent predators. Yuki
  reached the door panel. It was locked down, requiring a manual override.


  Her hands shook as she pried the interface cover. The shimmering entities hovered
  inches away, their cold, empty presence pressing against her skin. She jammed her
  decoder into the port, forcing herself to breathe through the terror. *Think, Yuki.
  Don''t look at them. Look at the wires.*


  With a spark and a hiss, the mechanism disengaged. The door slid open, and she stumbled
  through, sealing the entities on the other side. She was closer to the truth, but
  the station felt more like a tomb than ever.'
