output: 'Priya bounced onto the curb and flipped her camera to selfie mode. “First
  day jitters, y’all,” she told the internet, gesturing at the neon bus behind her.
  “Paneer-smoked brisket tacos, free to the first ten brave stomachs.” She winked,
  posted, and dragged Dev back inside before he could argue.


  Fifteen minutes later two college kids skateboarded up, laughing. “Saw you on TikTok,”
  one said. “Paneer me.” Priya seared cubes of cheese on the flat-top while Dev carved
  pepper-crusted brisket. The sizzle, the plume of ghee-laden smoke—one of the skaters
  filmed the whole show. “Smells like buttered campfire,” he narrated. When he bit
  in, his eyes went wide. “Dude, this slaps.” He uploaded the clip on the spot.


  Fun and Games rolled in like a flash flood. A trickle of curious Austinites became
  a river after a vegan parody account stitched the video with the caption, “Dairy
  deathwagon or genius fusion?” By sundown a queue snaked around the lot, and the
  pink bus glowed under string lights borrowed from the taco stand next door. Dev
  handled the register, Priya plated, both moving with a telepathy forged during sleepless
  prep nights. When the paneer ran low, Priya improvised, shaving smoked cheddar into
  the brisket drippings; Dev kept the crowd hyped with free samples of masala rub
  straight from a spice shaker. They laughed at each other’s grease-splattered faces,
  partners in a dance neither had rehearsed but somehow knew.


  Just when they found a rhythm, a matte-black trailer growled onto the lot, parking
  so close its fender kissed their bumper. FLOODGATE BBQ, gold letters boasted, with
  a championship trophy painted beside them. Out stepped Raul “Pit King” Morales,
  reigning Austin Food Truck champ, his beard as trimmed as his ego wasn’t. “Heard
  the circus came to town,” he said, eyes on their pink bus. “Figured I’d sell real
  meat to the people stuck in your line.”


  Priya smiled sweetly. “Hope you brought paneer.”


  Raul barked a laugh, fired up his smoker, and started handing out free ribs to anyone
  willing to step out of Priya’s line. Some did. Most didn’t—the internet was hungry
  for the new act—but the warning shot was clear: the king had noticed the upstarts.


  Near midnight the skater’s TikTok detonated past a million views. Local news vans
  rolled in, blinding the lot with floodlights. A reporter thrust a mic between Priya
  and Dev. “You two are the talk of Austin. How does it feel?”


  “Like we’re just getting started,” Priya said. She and Dev bumped elbows, grinning
  through exhaustion. In that breath they weren’t ex-consultants or overworked cooks—they
  were co-captains sailing the same absurd ship.


  Moments later her phone chimed: an email from the Austin Food Truck Championship
  committee. She tore it open and whooped. “We’re in the finals! Tomorrow night showcase
  slot!”


  Cheers erupted from the customers still waiting. Even Dev let himself exhale for
  the first time all day—until he kept reading. “Priya… there’s more.”


  She scanned the rest. “Effective this year,” the email read, “due to new sponsorship
  by Lone Star Almond Co., all finalists must present at least one entirely dairy-free
  signature dish.”


  They stared at the words, smoke curling between them. Paneer was their identity,
  their logo, even their Twitter handle. The same virality that rocketed them forward
  now pointed a spotlight at the one ingredient they couldn’t abandon without becoming
  something else.


  Outside, Raul Morales leaned against his trailer, polishing a rib bone like a warning.
  The crowd chanted for more paneer tacos, unaware that tomorrow every block of cheese
  would be contraband.


  Priya swallowed, tasting both victory and panic. “Looks like we just leveled up,
  partner.”


  Dev nodded, jaw set, mind already racing through spice blends. “Then let’s win twice.”


  The neon bus hissed as the burners dimmed, their moment of triumph glowing hot and
  fragile in the Texas night.'
