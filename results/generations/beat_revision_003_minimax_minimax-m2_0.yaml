output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly." Sophie noticed her hand reaching
  for her phone, then deliberately set it face-down in her lap. "Oh, great. Three
  emergencies while I was gone. Linda needs me to call her tonight."


  "Can''t it wait until morning?"


  Sophie considered this, remembering hours spent in silent contemplation. "You know
  what? It can wait." She powered off her phone entirely. "The Pearson account won''t
  collapse overnight."


  They drove in silence for a while. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through
  the evening haze. Sophie''s apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought
  her morning latte. Everything exactly as she''d left it.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, already planning to call Linda tomorrow—after
  breakfast, after a proper morning walk, after checking in with herself first.


  Life went on, but now Sophie would choose how.'
