output: 'The crew quarters were a gallery of interrupted lives. A half-finished chess
  game. A mug of cold, congealed coffee. Yuki’s scanner registered faint, impossible
  bio-signs—blips of energy that defied cellular structure—but found no bodies.


  The medical bay was worse. Logs showed a sudden, unanimous cessation of all vital
  signs forty-eight hours ago, followed by a massive, localized energy spike from
  Lab Seven. The data was corrupted, but one phrase repeated in Commander Reyes’s
  notes: *“The boundary is thinner than we thought.”*


  A whisper of cold air brushed Yuki’s neck. She spun, her light slicing through the
  gloom. For a heartbeat, the shadows in the corner *shimmered*, resolving into the
  faint, translucent outline of a man in an engineering uniform before dissolving
  into static.


  Her heart hammered. *Optical illusion. Stress-induced.* But her scanner chirped
  frantically, detecting a localized gravitational anomaly right where the figure
  had been.


  The main corridor to the lab sector was sealed, a power conduit ruptured and sparking.
  The only alternate route was through the malfunctioning hydroponics bay, where atmospheric
  processors had failed. The oxygen levels were safe, but the CO2 was critically high.
  She had fifteen minutes before cognitive impairment would set in.


  Yuki sealed her suit’s emergency filter and plunged into the jungle-like gloom.
  Vines brushed against her visor like grasping fingers. Shapes moved at the edge
  of her vision—flickers of lab coats, a glimmer of a face—always retreating, never
  clear. A tendril snagged her ankle, and she fell hard, her scanner skittering away.
  Gasping in the thick air, she crawled for it, her thoughts already beginning to
  fog.


  Her fingers closed on the device. The readout was clear: the anomalies weren’t random.
  They were *converging*, herding her toward Lab Seven. This wasn’t an accident. It
  was a pattern. A destination.


  She emerged from the bay, dizzy but clear-headed, facing the sealed door to the
  labs. The crew wasn’t gone. They were everywhere. And they were leading her.'
