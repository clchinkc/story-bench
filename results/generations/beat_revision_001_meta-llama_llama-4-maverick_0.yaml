output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. "Your brother''s fate awaits
  you. You failed him once; can you truly face his memory now?"


  Kira''s mind recoiled as the dragon''s words struck true. She thought of her brother''s
  death, of the guilt that still lingered. The weight of her failure threatened to
  consume her. She raised her sword, but her charge felt hesitant, as if driven by
  duty rather than resolve.


  The battle was brutal. Flame scorched her armor. Claws raked across her shield.
  Each blow felt like a reminder of her inadequacy. Kira stumbled back, her vision
  blurring as the dragon''s words echoed in her mind: "You failed him once." For a
  moment, she was trapped in the memory of that failure, reliving the pain and regret.


  As she fell to her knees, the dragon''s claws descended, and Kira felt her world
  go dark. But in that darkness, something shifted. She recalled her brother''s final
  moments, and the determination that had driven her to this point. With newfound
  ferocity, she launched herself at the dragon when it overextended on its strike.
  With the last of her strength, she drove her sword through the gap in its scales,
  piercing its heart.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  victorious but shaken. "I did it," she whispered, the words a mixture of triumph
  and vindication.


  She retrieved her sword, the weight of her guilt slightly lifted, and began the
  long walk back to camp.'
