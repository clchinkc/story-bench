output: 'Within an hour, the blogger''s dismissive post backfired spectacularly. The
  comments section exploded with defenders arguing that fusion was the future of food.
  A local comedian replied with "I''d eat at a disaster truck," which spawned a hashtag.
  By lunch, #DisasterTruck was trending citywide.


  The first customer arrived tentatively, phone already recording. Then another. Then
  ten more.


  "We need more paneer!" Priya shouted, elbow-deep in tandoori spice rub.


  Dev was already at the griddle, flipping brisket-stuffed parathas while simultaneously
  managing orders on their barely-functional tablet. "I''m out of tamarind chutney!"


  "Use the mango!"


  "That''s for the—"


  "Just use it!"


  They fell into a rhythm neither had anticipated: Priya''s bold instincts meeting
  Dev''s precision execution. When she experimented with a chai-braised brisket on
  the fly, he found a way to keep cook times consistent. When he worried about costs,
  she upsold extras with charm that had customers doubling their orders.


  By sunset, they''d sold out completely. A line still snaked down the block.


  "Tomorrow we triple the prep," Dev said, counting cash with hands that actually
  trembled with excitement.


  "Tomorrow we conquer Austin," Priya corrected.


  That''s when the smoke rolled in—not from their truck, but from the gleaming stainless
  steel monstrosity parking across the street. "Smoke & Thunder BBQ" in aggressive
  red letters. A man in an expensive cowboy hat emerged, surveying the crowd with
  a predator''s smile.


  "Marcus Chen," Dev muttered. "He won the Championship two years running."


  Marcus sauntered over, all swagger and calculated intimidation. "Cute truck. Pink''s
  really going to help when you''re competing against actual Texas barbecue." He nodded
  at their remaining customers. "Enjoy the charity cases."


  Priya felt her jaw tighten, but Dev''s hand on her shoulder stayed her response.


  After Marcus left, Dev met her eyes. "We can do this. Not despite the fusion thing—because
  of it."


  "You really believe that?"


  "I quit my job too, didn''t I?" He grinned, and for the first time, Priya saw her
  own reckless hope reflected back. "We''re either brilliant or insane."


  "Why not both?"


  The next two weeks blurred into beautiful chaos. Lines around the block. Features
  in three local papers. The blogger who''d mocked them posted an apology tour of
  their menu. Their bank account swelled from terrifying to merely worrying.


  Then the Championship organizer called.


  "You''re in," Priya announced, hanging up with shaking hands. "Official competitors.
  They loved our viral numbers."


  Dev whooped, pulling her into a completely platonic, entirely unprofessional victory
  hug.


  The email arrived ten minutes later. Championship rules. Priya''s stomach dropped
  at clause seventeen.


  "What?" Dev asked.


  "All recipes must be submitted for authenticity verification." She looked up. "My
  grandmother''s recipes—they''re not written down. She guards them like nuclear codes.
  And she still doesn''t know I quit consulting to run a food truck."


  Dev''s smile faded. "How long since you''ve talked to her?"


  "Three years," Priya admitted. "We had a disagreement about my life choices."


  "This seems fine," Dev said weakly. "Totally fine."'
