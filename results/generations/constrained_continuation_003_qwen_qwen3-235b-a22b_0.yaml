output: "Jin stepped into the orbital ring’s processing hub, a cavernous chamber where\
  \ the air tasted recycled and the lighting flickered with the irregular rhythm of\
  \ someone else’s sleep cycle. The Collective’s promised freedom felt more like entropy—stations\
  \ spun in loose orbit around one another, connected by cables and grudges as much\
  \ as ideology. A woman with a shaved head and a patchwork jacket stamped his wrist\
  \ with a biometric ink that shimmered red, then faded. “You’re on your own until\
  \ you pay the welcome tax,” she said. “That’s how we keep the vultures out.”  \n\
  \nKael, his eventual guide, found him hours later in a zero-g lounge, adrift among\
  \ refugees and mercenaries. Her eyes carried the weariness of someone who’d believed\
  \ in revolutions long ago. “You leaked the carbon data? Pissed off Earth’s entire\
  \ ruling class? Cute.” She tossed him a protein bar. “Welcome to the only place\
  \ that doesn’t care if you’re a saint or a terrorist. Just pay your debts.”  \n\n\
  The Collective’s “independence” masked a fractal bureaucracy. To access resources,\
  \ Jin needed patronage from one of the station blocs—either the Engineers, who controlled\
  \ power grids and oxygen; the Merchants, who hoarded Earth imports; or the Archivists,\
  \ who guarded data like dragons. Kael, a disgraced ex-Archivist, warned him the\
  \ idealists who’d founded the Collective were long gone. “We’re just another corporate\
  \ board now. Louder, but just as hungry.”  \n\nJin’s search for allies led him to\
  \ the Archivists’ repository, a labyrinth of servers where Earth’s banned science\
  \ collected digital dust. While scrubbing data for his welcome tax, he found his\
  \ own leak buried under encrypted layers—a version altered to exclude the Collective’s\
  \ involvement. The suppressed carbon capture tech hadn’t been a secret from the\
  \ Collective. They’d pioneered it.  \n\n“Earth didn’t silence your breakthrough,”\
  \ Kael said when he confronted her. “We did. The Council paid us to keep quiet.\
  \ Clean air, clean water? That’s debt. You want to ‘make a difference’? Start by\
  \ surviving.”  \n\nThat night, Jin filmed himself in a docking bay maintenance closet,\
  \ his face lit by a handheld lamp. The broadcast went everywhere: Earth’s censored\
  \ networks, the Collective’s gossip loops, the Merchant black markets. He didn’t\
  \ mention the Archivists’ betrayal. He spoke of Earth’s dying coasts, of his parents’\
  \ likely imprisonment, of the technology that could still be rebuilt. By dawn, the\
  \ Engineers offered him shelter. The Merchants, a propaganda platform. The Archivists?\
  \ A quiet warning. “You’ll need a better hiding place.”  \n\nTaking the Engineers’\
  \ deal meant abandoning the full truth. Taking the Merchants’ meant becoming a symbol,\
  \ not a scientist. Jin chose the Engineers, but let the Merchants edit his next\
  \ speech. The cost was immediate: a message from the Archivists showing Yuna’s face—alive,\
  \ but bracketed by capture timestamps. They’d found her on Earth. They’d keep her\
  \ safe, they said, if Jin buried the Collective’s complicity.  \n\nHe agreed.  \n\
  \nWhen he stepped onto the station’s main broadcast deck, the Collective’s flags\
  \ fluttering behind him, Jin recited the Merchants’ lines about Earth’s “tyranny\
  \ of silence.” He omitted the cables that tied the Collective to the same fossil\
  \ fortunes. He felt Yuna’s absence like a phantom limb.  \n\nKael found him afterward,\
  \ staring at the altered data files. “You sold your rage to buy hers,” she said,\
  \ not unkindly. “Now you’re both stuck in the lie.”  \n\nJin tightened his grip\
  \ on the memory chip—proof the Collective had chosen profit over planet. He couldn’t\
  \ fight them yet. But in the quiet dark between stations, he began rebuilding the\
  \ carbon model, one stolen equation at a time. The fight would be different here.\
  \ Slower. Sharper.  \n\nHe had a platform. He had Yuna’s chance to live.  \n\nThe\
  \ price of both was his silence. For now."
