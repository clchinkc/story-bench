output: "The kitchen was bathed in the amber glow of the oven light when Maya found\
  \ him. Alejandro wasn’t the untouchable titan of the pitch in that moment; he was\
  \ hunched over a copper saucepan, his leg braced awkwardly against a stool. The\
  \ scent of burnt sugar hung heavy and bitter in the air.\n\n\"It’s supposed to be\
  \ *crema catalana*,\" he muttered, not looking up. \"My mother made it every Sunday.\
  \ I thought... if I could get the smell right, the house wouldn't feel so quiet.\"\
  \n\nMaya didn't comment on the late hour or his intrusion into her workspace. She\
  \ simply moved beside him, gently taking the whisk from his hand. His fingers were\
  \ cold, trembling slightly from the effort of standing too long on his injured knee.\
  \ \"The trick isn't the heat, Alejandro,\" she said softly. \"It's the patience.\
  \ You’re rushing the temper.\"\n\nShe started over, her movements fluid and practiced.\
  \ As she stirred the milk with cinnamon and lemon zest, Alejandro began to speak,\
  \ his voice low and stripped of his usual defensive bite. He didn't talk about the\
  \ goals or the trophies. He talked about the sudden, terrifying silence that followed\
  \ the day his career ended—how the villa wasn't a palace, but a gilded cage he’d\
  \ built to hide a man who no longer knew who he was without a ball at his feet.\n\
  \nIn the quiet of the kitchen, the professional distance evaporated. When the custard\
  \ was finally perfect, she didn't plate it for a client; she handed him a spoon.\
  \ They stood over the marble island, sharing the warm, citrus-scented cream directly\
  \ from the pot. \n\n\"Why are you really here, Maya?\" he asked, his dark eyes searching\
  \ hers. \"Lucia says you’re the only one who hasn't complained about the isolation.\"\
  \n\nMaya thought of the mounting bills and her grandmother’s tired eyes, but for\
  \ the first time, those reasons felt distant. She looked at the man who had been\
  \ a ghost in his own home, now standing vulnerable in the light. \n\n\"I came because\
  \ I needed the money,\" she admitted, her voice steady. \"But I’m staying because\
  \ I want to see you actually taste your life again.\"\n\nIt was the pivot point.\
  \ She was no longer just fulfilling a contract; she was choosing him. As Alejandro\
  \ reached out, his thumb grazing a smudge of flour on her cheek, the two million\
  \ euro penalty felt like a whisper against the roar of her own pulse. She was no\
  \ longer a spectator in his life; she was a participant."
