output: 'They dashed through the twisting tunnels, the air thick with the stench of
  damp earth and flickering torch smoke. The Scorpion Guild''s shouts echoed behind
  them, growing closer. Zara''s lungs burned, but she kept pace with Tomás, his scholarly
  robes flapping like a flag of surrender. The underground market had tested her already—dodging
  pickpockets, bargaining with shady merchants for supplies, and evading Guild spies
  who saw her as easy prey. Tomás had proven an ally, sharing scraps of lore about
  the Sunken Library, but enemies lurked in every shadow, and trust was a luxury she
  couldn''t afford.


  "This passage," Tomás panted, pointing to a narrow crevice hidden behind a stall
  of withered herbs. "It leads to the Approach. Ancient traps guard the way to the
  Library''s heart. We must be careful."


  Zara nodded, her thief''s instincts kicking in. She''d lifted the map from a Guild
  enforcer''s pocket without a sound, a skill honed in the capital''s slums where
  one wrong move meant starvation. As they squeezed into the crevice, the tunnel narrowed,
  forcing them to crawl. The walls pressed in, rough stone scraping her skin. Ahead,
  faint glyphs glowed on the floor—warnings in a forgotten tongue that Tomás translated
  under his breath.


  But the Guild was relentless. Footsteps thundered closer, and suddenly, a scorpion-marked
  thug blocked their exit, dagger drawn. "The map belongs to us, thief!"


  Zara''s knife flashed, but Tomás lunged first, tackling the man in a clumsy brawl.
  They tumbled, and the thug''s blade sliced Tomás''s arm. Blood sprayed, and Tomás
  cried out. Zara saw her chance—a side vent leading to safety, just wide enough for
  her alone. Escape beckoned, a clean getaway to pursue the Library solo. Her mother''s
  face flashed in her mind, withered and pleading for a cure. But Tomás had guided
  her this far, his knowledge her only edge. Leaving him meant betraying the fragile
  alliance she''d built, and in this morally gray underworld, alliances were all that
  separated survivors from the dead.


  With a curse, she chose. Zara dove back, using her agility to slip behind the thug
  and hook her foot around his ankle, yanking him off balance. Tomás finished him
  with a desperate shove, sending the man crumpling. "Why?" Tomás gasped, clutching
  his wound.


  "Because I need you," Zara muttered, binding his arm with a strip of her cloak.
  But doubt gnawed at her— was he truly an ally, or just another enemy in disguise?


  They pressed on into the Approach, the tunnel descending into darkness. The air
  grew colder, heavy with the weight of forgotten secrets. Tomás lit a small lantern,
  revealing a chamber ahead: a vast pit spanned by a rickety bridge of crumbling stone,
  rigged with pressure plates that promised collapse. "A test of cunning," Tomás said.
  "Step wrong, and it all falls."


  Zara''s thief skills shone here. She studied the plates, noting the faint dust patterns
  and hairline cracks—tells from years of spotting hidden compartments and weak locks.
  "Follow my steps exactly." She moved like a shadow, testing each slab with a gentle
  prod, her heartbeat thundering. One wrong move, and they''d plunge into the abyss.
  Midway, a plate shifted under Tomás''s foot. The bridge groaned, stones raining
  down.


  "Jump!" Zara yelled, grabbing his hand. They leaped to safety as the bridge shattered
  behind them. Panting on the other side, Tomás slumped against the wall. "I... I
  owe you the truth. I''m not just a disgraced scholar. The Library holds a forbidden
  text that could restore my family''s honor—stolen by the Guild years ago. I help
  you to get it back for myself. If it means using you... well, survival demands compromises."


  Zara''s stomach twisted. Morally complex, indeed—his desperation mirrored her own,
  a desperate hope that the Library''s knowledge could redeem them both. But betrayal
  stung. "You could have told me."


  "Would you have trusted me?" he countered.


  Deeper they went, the Approach yielding to the Inmost Cave''s threshold. The Ordeal
  awaited: a sealed door etched with riddles, guarded by a mechanism that flooded
  the chamber with sand if unsolved. Zara''s fingers traced the inscriptions, her
  mind racing. Failure here meant death, but more than physical peril, it unearthed
  her deepest fear—the terror of failing her mother, of returning empty-handed to
  watch her waste away. In the slums, she''d stolen to survive, but what if she wasn''t
  clever enough for this? What if her skills, her choices, weren''t enough?


  The riddle clicked: a sequence of levers pulled in the order of ancient constellations.
  But as the door ground open, a trap sprang—sand poured from ceiling vents, rising
  like a desert tide. They scrambled inside, but the flow sealed them in a narrowing
  tomb. Sand filled her boots, her mouth, burying her alive. Panic clawed at her—
  this was failure incarnate, the weight of every doubt crushing her. She thrashed,
  symbolically dying to her old self, the girl who ran from fears, reborn in the struggle.
  With a surge of desperate hope, she spotted a weak seam in the wall, using her knife
  to pry it open. Sand burst through, draining away, leaving them gasping in a hidden
  alcove.


  Zara emerged changed—harder, her fear of failure tempered into resolve. No more
  doubting her path; she''d press on, cure or no. But as they caught their breath,
  torchlight flickered ahead. The Library''s antechamber loomed, but shadows moved
  within—more Scorpion Guild enforcers, somehow ahead of them, blocking the way to
  the inner vaults. The Ordeal was survived, but a new complication barred their quest.'
