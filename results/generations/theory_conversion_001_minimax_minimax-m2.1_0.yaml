output: 'Dr. Samira Hassan had spent fifteen years building her reputation as a virologist,
  carefully constructing her world one discovery at a time. Her colleagues trusted
  her judgments. Her research had been published in every major journal. She had earned
  the right to be certain about things.


  That certainty shattered on a Tuesday evening, when the anomalous protein structure
  glowed on her monitor. The sample from Patient Zero showed something impossible—a
  virus that defied every model she''d studied in her career. It shouldn''t exist.
  It couldn''t exist.


  "Dr. Hassan?" Her assistant Raj stood in the doorway. "The CDC is on line two. They
  want to know why we requested an emergency containment team."


  She stared at the data. If she was wrong, her career would collapse under the weight
  of a false alarm. If she was right, they were all in danger. "Tell them we have
  a potential Level 4 outbreak," she said, and watched Raj''s face pale as he reached
  for the phone.


  The next seventy-two hours collapsed into a blur of controlled chaos. The containment
  team arrived in hazmat suits. The hospital was quarantined. And more patients kept
  arriving with the same impossible symptoms, their bodies hosting a pathogen that
  evolved faster than Samira could study it.


  "We''re missing something," she told Raj at hour sixty, surrounded by failed test
  results and empty coffee cups. The data mocked her from every screen. "It''s not
  mutating randomly. It''s adapting. Like it''s designed to."


  The realization hit like ice water. She pulled up Patient Zero''s file again, searching
  for what she''d missed. There—in the employer field: Nexus Biotech. A company that
  had been quietly buying up gene-editing patents for years, staying just below the
  radar of regulatory scrutiny.


  "Oh god," she whispered. "It''s not natural. Someone made this."


  The confrontation with Nexus came twelve hours before the quarantine was set to
  fail. Samira had the proof—sequences that matched their patented vectors exactly—but
  Nexus had lawyers, PR teams, and a senator on speed dial. Their CEO looked at her
  across a mahogany conference table with pity.


  "Dr. Hassan, you''re sitting on information that could destroy a hundred billion
  dollars in market value," he said smoothly. "We will bury you. Every credential,
  every publication, every reputation you''ve built—it will all disappear. Sign this
  NDA and walk away, or become the biggest fraud in virology history."


  She looked at the document. At the career she''d spent fifteen years building. At
  the choice between her survival and the truth.


  "No," she said.


  The press conference was chaos. Cameras flashed. Reporters shouted questions. Nexus''s
  lawyers threatened lawsuits in real-time, their PR team spinning frantically about
  "unverified data" and "irresponsible accusations." But Samira had one card left
  to play—the formula for the cure, developed in those sleepless hours, shared simultaneously
  with every major news outlet and medical journal in the world.


  "You can sue me into oblivion," she said into the cameras, her voice steady despite
  the tremor in her hands. "But you can''t patent something that belongs to everyone."


  Six weeks later, the outbreak was contained. Nexus was under federal investigation.
  Dr. Samira Hassan was unemployable at any major institution—her name toxic to administrators
  who feared Nexus''s lawyers even in defeat. But she could sleep at night. She had
  chosen the truth over her career, and in the silence of her small apartment, she
  found something she hadn''t expected.


  Peace.'
