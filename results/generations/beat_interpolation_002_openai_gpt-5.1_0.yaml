output: 'Sarah sat on the edge of her bed, the photo of Amy spread on the comforter
  like a piece of evidence at a crime scene. She forced herself to look past the ropes,
  past the bruising at Amy’s temple, to the background: rusted metal, flaking gray
  paint, a partial stenciled “7” on a support beam.


  Warehouse, older district. She cataloged every detail because the alternative was
  thinking about the phone call.


  Recanting was clean. Simple. She pictured herself on the stand, eyes downcast. “I
  must have been mistaken, Your Honor.” Vincent Marchetti walks. Amy lives.


  Maybe.


  Her mind supplied the rest like a report: Witness recants under duress. Marchetti
  family eliminates liability anyway. Probability of Amy’s survival… she didn’t finish
  the thought. The envelope hadn’t been about negotiation. It had been about power.


  Still, the thought of saying the words—“I lied”—made her stomach twist. Every victim
  whose case had crossed her desk, every rookie who’d looked at her like she was what
  a good cop should be… she’d be spitting in their faces.


  She dressed on autopilot and drove to the precinct, white-knuckling the steering
  wheel the whole way. There was another option. Protocol. Go to Morrison. Call the
  FBI. Witness protection, emergency task force, lock down the city.


  She found Marcus in the squad room, tie crooked, coffee in hand. He took one look
  at her and set the cup down.


  “What happened?”


  She didn’t show him the photo, but she told him everything else. The call. The threat.
  The deadline.


  “We go up the chain,” he said immediately. “Morrison, DA, feds if we have to. We
  put surveillance on you and your sister’s place, pull phone records, traffic cams—”


  “Assuming nobody tips Marchetti first,” she cut in. “IA still hasn’t found the leak
  from last year. You think his people don’t have someone listening the second Morrison
  picks up a phone?”


  Marcus’s jaw tightened. “We can control it. Keep it small. I’ll handpick—”


  “Like you handpicked the raid team on the harbor deal?” she asked softly. Two officers
  dead. Marchetti’s guys waiting in perfect formation.


  Silence stretched between them.


  “I’m not letting you handle this alone,” he said finally.


  “You can’t handle it inside the lines,” she replied. “Not this.”


  Her duty was clear: testify, put Marchetti away. Her heart didn’t care about clarity.
  It cared about the girl in the photo who’d followed her around in mismatched socks
  when they were kids.


  Duty vs. Amy. Law vs. blood. System vs. a family that owned half the system.


  She felt something settle in her chest—not a decision yet, but the outline of one.
  If the choices were: betray every victim she’d ever sworn to protect, or trust a
  compromised machine to save the one person she couldn’t lose… then she needed a
  third answer.


  One that didn’t exist on any form or in any manual.


  “I’ll testify,” she said at last. “And I’ll get Amy back.”


  “How?” Marcus asked.


  “I don’t know,” she lied. But as she walked past Morrison’s closed door, the resignation
  letter already half-formed in her mind, she knew the solution wouldn’t be found
  here.'
