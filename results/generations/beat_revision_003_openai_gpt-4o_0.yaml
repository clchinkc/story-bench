output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... transformative. I learned to let go of some things." Sophie glanced at
  her phone, the work emails flashing insistently. She took a deep breath and turned
  the phone face down in her lap. "Three emergencies while I was gone. Linda needs
  me to call her tonight."


  "Can''t it wait until morning?"


  Sophie hesitated, then smiled softly. "You know, maybe it can. The Pearson account
  will still be there." She settled back into her seat, watching the city lights blur
  past.


  They drove in a companionable silence, the familiar Chicago skyline appearing through
  the evening haze. Sophie''s apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought
  her morning latte. Everything exactly as she''d left it.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, feeling the steady rhythm of the city around
  her. This time, she meant it with a newfound sense of peace.'
