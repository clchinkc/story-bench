output: 'I need to revise this segment to show Rachel''s character through action
  rather than telling. The current version relies too heavily on info-dumping instead
  of showing the protagonist''s world through scene.


  Detective Rachel Torres pushed through the glass doors of the Riverside Precinct,
  her weathered leather jacket catching the morning light. Twelve years on the force
  had taught her to read the room instantly—crime boards crowded with case files,
  detectives hunched over desks, the familiar hum of a precinct in motion.


  "Sherlock gave me that look again this morning," she mentioned to James as they
  passed in the hallway, her partner''s familiar nod acknowledging their shared understanding
  of the cat''s judgmental stares during 5 AM feeding time.


  Rachel''s desk bore the accumulated evidence of her reputation—cold case folders
  stacked three deep, case photos pinned to a cork board that had become a small memorial
  to the forgotten. Her father would have approved of her persistence, though he''d
  retired before she''d learned to balance stubbornness with results.


  The Riverside Precinct''s daily rhythm was predictable: morning briefings, coffee
  that tasted like burnt ambition, the constant ring of phones. In Queens, where her
  small apartment overlooked the neighborhood where wealthy families lived alongside
  working-class residents, stability had been the norm for years. Crime rates remained
  steady, mostly property crimes increasing as economic pressures mounted.


  But something in the morning briefing felt different. Rachel sensed it before James
  finished reading the call sheet—the way his voice paused, the way other detectives''
  conversations died mid-sentence. Her sharp instincts, honed over a decade of chasing
  cold trails, prickled with recognition.


  Tuesday morning in October had arrived like any other. The disruption would wait
  another few minutes.'
