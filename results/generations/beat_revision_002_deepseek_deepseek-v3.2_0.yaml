output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director, her
  voice thin with a hope he could no longer afford.


  "I don''t know." Marcus slumped into his chair. "We could try to find another location,
  but the rent anywhere else would be triple what we pay here. We don''t have that."


  "What about the fundraiser? We still have three weeks. If we could raise enough—"


  "It''s dead, Denise." He rubbed his temples, the pressure building behind his eyes.
  "The major donor just pulled out. An hour ago. I didn’t want to say it."


  "And the grant application?"


  "Rejection email. This morning." He watched the color drain from her face. "There''s
  nothing left to play."


  His phone buzzed. Not his wife. A notification from his bank. The automatic mortgage
  payment had failed. Insufficient funds. He’d poured everything into keeping the
  center afloat this quarter.


  Denise stood, avoiding his eyes. "Marcus... I’m sorry. I have to be practical. I’ve
  accepted a position with the city’s parks department. I start next month."


  She gathered her things, a quiet, final rustle. "I’m really sorry."


  The door clicked shut behind her. The silence in the office was absolute, a physical
  weight. The notice fluttered from his fingers. Every door was closed. Every ally
  was gone. Every penny was spent. He had nothing. He was nothing. The center was
  a corpse, and he was just the man left alone in the empty room with it.'
