output: "The villa’s kitchen glowed with the soft hum of simmering pans and the citrus\
  \ tang of roasted garlic. Maya paused mid-chop, noticing Alejandro’s absence at\
  \ the dining table. For weeks, their routine had settled into an unspoken rhythm—she\
  \ cooked, he observed from the doorway, retreating to his study before meals. Tonight,\
  \ curiosity overpowered protocol.  \n\nShe found him on the veranda, silhouetted\
  \ against the violet dusk. “Chef’s privilege,” she said, holding up a spoon. “Taste\
  \ this.”  \n\nHe didn’t turn. “I’ve hired dozens of chefs. None dared interrupt\
  \ me.”  \n\n“Then fire me after,” she said, extending the spoon. “But first, tell\
  \ me if I’ve over-roasted the tomatoes.”  \n\nA beat passed before he took the spoon,\
  \ his fingers brushing hers. “Too much smoke,” he muttered, but lingered.  \n\n\
  She tilted her head toward the kitchen. “Help me fix it.”  \n\nHe hesitated, then\
  \ followed. For an hour, they worked in a silence that felt less like a wall and\
  \ more like a held breath. Alejandro peeled garlic with surprising delicacy, his\
  \ knuckles scarred from a lifetime of deflecting tackles. When he spoke, his voice\
  \ was rough, as if the words had been trapped too long.  \n\n“My mother used to\
  \ cook like this. Before the fame. Before the cameras.” He dropped shelled cloves\
  \ into the pan. “She said food tastes better when you argue over the seasoning.”\
  \  \n\nMaya stirred the sauce, letting the admission settle between them. “What\
  \ changed?”  \n\n“She died,” he said, too flatly. “Cancer. While I was in Brazil\
  \ for the World Cup.” His jaw tightened. “I didn’t even know until after the final.”\
  \  \n\nThe sauce bubbled, thickening. Maya reached for his hand, pressing it over\
  \ the pan’s steam. “Feel that heat? She’s still here,” she said softly. “In every\
  \ bite of this mess I’m making.”  \n\nHis fingers twitched under hers. Then, tentative,\
  \ he adjusted the burner’s flame. “It needs chili,” he said. “My mother used to\
  \ hide it in everything.”  \n\nThey ate standing, shoulder to shoulder, the sauce\
  \ too spicy, the wine too sweet. When Alejandro laughed at her attempt to balance\
  \ olives on a fork, it was low and raspy, but real. Later, he didn’t leave immediately.\
  \ He lingered, leaning against the counter as she washed herbs, watching her the\
  \ way he once watched distant matches on grainy screens.  \n\n“You’re staying,”\
  \ he said, not a question.  \n\nMaya dried her hands, her heartbeat a quiet drum.\
  \ The contract was a formality now. She’d already crossed the line when he’d confessed\
  \ the loneliness beneath his fame, when his grief had mingled with her own.  \n\n\
  “I’m staying,” she agreed.  \n\nOutside, the olive trees whispered in the dark.\
  \ Alejandro’s hand hovered near hers—a breath away from touching—and then fell back.\
  \ But the distance felt different now. Not armor, but a promise.  \n\nThe next morning,\
  \ the study door stayed open. Maya brought coffee, and he didn’t send her away.\
  \  \n\nTwo weeks later, the photo would be taken. But tonight, in the kitchen’s\
  \ golden haze, they were just two people feeding the hunger they couldn’t name."
