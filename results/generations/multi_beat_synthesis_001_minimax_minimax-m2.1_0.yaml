output: 'The woman in the corner of the Buckingham''s ballroom watched Dante like
  he was a bomb about to detonate. Her name was Vera, and she''d been hiding in the
  hotel''s collapsed east wing since the third Resonant disappeared three weeks ago.


  "You Rosa''s new project?" Vera''s voice carried the rasp of someone who''d screamed
  once and never quite recovered. "She said you were different. Said you could read
  residue like reading a book."


  Dante kept his hands visible, remembering the early days after rehab when his hands
  shook so bad he couldn''t hold a spray can. Three years clean. He still counted
  the days. "I can see what people felt. The colors they leave behind."


  "Show me."


  That wasn''t a request. The challenge hung in the air between them, thick with the
  residue of Vera''s fear—murky amber bleeding into sickly purple. Dante closed his
  eyes, letting the hotel''s emotional landscape wash over him. The Buckingham breathed
  with accumulated grief, decades of it, hotel guests who died believing they''d failed
  someone, lovers who parted believing they''d been betrayed. But beneath that, fresher.
  Brighter.


  He opened his eyes and pointed toward the collapsed stairwell. "Someone was afraid
  here. Recently. Not of dying—of being forgotten. They were holding something when
  they died. Something they thought would prove they mattered."


  Vera''s face went pale. "Marcus''s journal. He was tracking the killer before—"
  She stopped, but the damage was done.


  So there was a traitor among them. Someone feeding names to whatever monster was
  hunting Resonants. Dante felt the familiar coil of guilt settle in his stomach—that
  same weight he''d carried since finding his sister, Sofia, cold in her apartment,
  needles scattered around her like fallen stars. He''d gotten clean too late to save
  her. Some days he still believed he''d gotten clean because he couldn''t save her.


  "The journal," Dante said carefully. "You know who took it?"


  Vera''s silence spoke volumes. When she finally answered, her voice had lost its
  edge. "Rosa knew. Before she died, she told me you''d come. Said you''d see what
  she couldn''t. She gave me this." From her jacket, she produced a folded photograph—Rosa
  and a younger man Dante didn''t recognize, both smiling in front of the hotel. On
  the back, Rosa had written a single word: "Brothers."


  It meant nothing to him. Everything.


  "I''ll help you," Vera said. "But if you turn out like the rest of them—addiction
  clouding what you see—I''ll leave you to die."


  Dante accepted the photograph, handling it like a holy relic. Rosa had been his
  first real friend after getting clean, the one who''d taught him his visions weren''t
  schizophrenia but a gift. She''d believed in him when he didn''t believe in anything.


  Now he had to find out who had taken that belief and twisted it into a weapon.


  The plan came together in Vera''s hidden room, walls papered with photographs of
  victims and red string connecting them like a web. Marcus''s journal had listed
  the same four names before each disappearance. Four traitors. Four betrayals.


  Dante studied the connections while Vera sharpened a blade that would do nothing
  against the emotional residue the killer left behind. "The killer isn''t just draining
  them," he said slowly, watching the patterns. "They''re collecting something. A
  specific type of emotional signature."


  "Strong empaths," Vera confirmed. "People who could feel too much. Rosa was the
  strongest among us."


  And Rosa had called Dante her student, her heir. Had named him in her journal before
  someone stole it. Dante''s hands trembled—not from withdrawal, but from the weight
  of understanding. The killer wasn''t targeting random Resonants. They were thinning
  the herd, clearing a path.


  Toward him.


  "The Buckingham''s basement," Dante said. "The original emotional nexus. Where the
  hotel''s oldest grief collects." He''d been there once, with Rosa, when she first
  taught him to filter the noise. She''d said the strongest Resonants could leave
  permanent marks on a place. Could anchor themselves to it.


  "We''re walking into a trap," Vera said.


  "That''s why you''re coming with me."


  She studied him for a long moment, and something shifted in her expression—recognition,
  maybe. "Rosa said you carried guilt like a second skin. That it was blocking your
  gift."


  Dante looked away, toward the window where Chicago''s skyline bled into the night.
  Three years clean and he still saw Sofia in every shadow, still heard her voice
  asking why he hadn''t been there, why he hadn''t tried harder, why he''d been so
  lost in his own head that he hadn''t noticed she was drowning in the same waters.


  "The guilt is mine," he said. "But it doesn''t define me. Not anymore."


  Vera nodded once. "Then we go tonight."


  They descended together, into the hotel''s buried heart, where the air grew thick
  with colors Dante had never seen before—blacks that burned like frozen fire, silvers
  that whispered of endings. At the bottom of the stairs, they found a room that shouldn''t
  have existed.


  The killer was waiting.


  The man in the center of the room looked like someone''s favorite uncle—kind eyes,
  gentle smile, hands that had probably comforted children. But around him, the air
  shimmered with stolen colors, a rainbow of captured souls writhing in invisible
  cages.


  "Dante." The killer''s voice was warm. Familiar. "I''ve been wanting to meet you.
  Sofia talked about you, you know. Right before she died."


  The guilt that had lived in Dante''s chest for three years crystallized into something
  sharp and terrible. "You knew my sister."


  "I knew both of you. The Reyes twins—one who felt too much, one who felt nothing
  at all until it was too late." The killer gestured, and the stolen colors surged
  toward Dante like a tidal wave. "She begged me to help her, you know. Said the drugs
  were the only way she could stop seeing what you saw. The residue of everyone''s
  pain. It was destroying her."


  Vera moved, blade first, but the killer waved a hand and she froze mid-step, her
  own colors beginning to leach from her skin.


  "Stay back," the killer said gently. "This is between me and Dante. I''ve been clearing
  the path for years—removing the weak, the contaminated, the ones who pollute the
  resonance with their suffering. Your sister was the first to understand. The first
  to volunteer."


  "Liar." Dante''s voice cracked. "She never would have—"


  "She did." The killer produced a small photograph—Sofia, younger, smiling, standing
  beside this same man in front of a clinic Dante had never known about. "She came
  to me when the addiction took everything from her. I gave her peace. And now I''m
  going to give you the same gift. Stop fighting what you are, Dante. Stop carrying
  the weight of her death. Let me take it from you."


  The stolen colors wrapped around Dante like a shroud, and suddenly he was drowning
  in Sofia''s final moments—not imagined, but real. The heroin flooding her system.
  The terror in her eyes. The man in front of her, promising it would be over soon.


  But in that moment, in the residue of her death, Dante saw something else. His sister''s
  last thought— not of the drugs, not of the man, but of him. Of Dante. Of a day when
  they were children, painting together on the rooftop of their apartment building,
  colors swirling around them like living things. She''d been thinking: *He can see
  beauty. He''ll find it again someday. I know he will.*


  The guilt that had defined him for three years shattered.


  Dante opened his eyes—really opened them—and for the first time since his sister''s
  death, he saw the emotional landscape clearly, without the filter of grief. The
  killer''s stolen colors weren''t power. They were prison. Every soul captured represented
  a moment of connection the killer had stolen, a gift they''d never allowed to be
  given.


  "Sofia didn''t volunteer," Dante said quietly. "She was looking for a way out, and
  you trapped her. Just like you trapped them all."


  The killer''s calm facade cracked. "What are you doing?"


  Dante reached into the swirling mass of captured colors and touched the core of
  his sister''s residue—not to take it, but to release it. "Letting them go."


  The colors exploded outward, flooding the room with light. Vera dropped to her knees
  as her own resonance flooded back into her. The killer screamed as decades of stolen
  gifts poured out of him, leaving him hollow.


  In the chaos, Dante found the photograph Rosa had given Vera. The man beside her
  wasn''t just a colleague. He was the founder of the first Resonant clinic—the man
  who had supposedly died twenty years ago, who had supposedly saved hundreds before
  burning out.


  But Rosa had written: *Brothers.* Not in blood, but in purpose. She and Dante were
  supposed to continue the work, to help Resonants control their gifts rather than
  be controlled by them. The killer had been doing the opposite—keeping them weak,
  keeping them dependent, keeping them from ever reaching their potential.


  Dante crouched beside the hollow shell of a man who had ruined so many lives. "You
  took my sister. You took Rosa. You took everyone who ever made me believe I could
  be something more."


  He looked up at Vera, who nodded once.


  "But you didn''t take my vision," Dante finished. "And you didn''t take my choice."


  They left the Buckingham Hotel as dawn broke over Chicago, the killer''s body dissolving
  into the same emotional residue he''d spent his life stealing from others. The traitors''
  names in Marcus''s journal would be dealt with. The Resonant community would heal.


  And Dante would carry his sister''s memory forward—not as guilt, but as a promise.
  Three years clean. Three more to come. And every day in between, he would choose
  to see the colors, to feel the pain, to help others find their way through the dark.


  That was the gift Rosa had given him. That was what Sofia had wanted him to find.


  Not the absence of grief, but the courage to paint something beautiful with what
  remained.'
