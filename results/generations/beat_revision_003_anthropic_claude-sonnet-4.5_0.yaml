output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful." Sophie gazed out the window instead of reaching
  for her phone. "The meditation retreat was harder than I expected. All that silence."


  "Did it help?"


  "I think so." Sophie felt her phone buzz in her pocket—work emails piling up, no
  doubt. She left it there. "I learned I''ve been running on autopilot for years."


  Her mother glanced over, surprised.


  The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through the evening haze. Sophie recognized
  the tightness creeping back into her shoulders, the old reflex to check, respond,
  manage. She took a breath, feeling it the way the meditation teacher had shown her.


  Her phone buzzed again. Then again.


  "You should probably check that," her mother said.


  Sophie pulled out her phone. Three emergencies. Linda needed her to call tonight
  about the Pearson account. The old Sophie would already be typing, apologizing,
  fixing.


  She turned off the screen.


  "It can wait until morning," she said quietly. "Linda will survive one night without
  me. The Pearson account will still be there tomorrow."


  "Really?"


  Sophie smiled, uncertain but steady. "I''m going to try something different. I spent
  two weeks learning to sit with discomfort instead of immediately reacting. Might
  as well start now."


  They drove in silence for a while. Sophie watched her darkened phone, resisting
  the urge to turn it back on.


  "It''s good to be home," she said. And this time, she meant home—not the office,
  not the emergencies, not the endless cycle of response and reaction.


  It wouldn''t be easy. But something had shifted.'
