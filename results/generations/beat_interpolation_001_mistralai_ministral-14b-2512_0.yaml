output: 'Elena woke with the map’s glow still seared into her eyelids, the weight
  of her grandmother’s words pressing down like a book she’d tried to ignore. She
  hadn’t gone to the forest—she’d gone to the one place that made sense: *The Curious
  Compass*, a shop wedged between a blacksmith’s forge and a bakery that smelled suspiciously
  of expired incense. The bell above the door jingled as she stepped inside, where
  shelves sagged under jars of dried things—eyeballs, feathers, a single silver key
  floating in a vial of murky liquid.


  Behind the counter, a man with ink-stained fingers and a beard streaked with gray
  looked up from a ledger. “You’re the one who left the map at your grandmother’s,”
  he said, not a question. “Elena, right?”


  She froze. “How do you—?”


  “Because the map didn’t just *appear* to you,” he said, setting down his quill.
  “It *chose* you. And choices leave traces.” He gestured to the shelves. “I’m Marcus.
  Former cartographer, occasional thief, and the only person in this town who still
  remembers how to read those runes.”


  Elena’s fingers twitched toward the satchel she’d slung over her shoulder—her grandmother’s
  old leather bag, the one with the loose stitching she’d meant to mend for years.
  “I don’t need a map,” she muttered. “I need… I need to know if I’m even *supposed*
  to do this.”


  Marcus leaned on the counter, studying her the way she studied a stubbornly silent
  patron. “You’re a librarian. You know how to find things that aren’t supposed to
  be found.” He reached under the counter and slid a small brass compass toward her.
  The needle spun like a drunkard before settling on a direction that didn’t exist
  on any chart. “The forest doesn’t care about fighting. It cares about *knowing*.
  And you, Elena, know more than you think.”


  She picked it up, the metal warm against her palm. “What if I’m wrong?”


  “Then you’ll be wrong *there*,” he said, nodding toward the window, where the first
  light of dawn touched the edge of Thornwood. “But wrong’s better than never trying.”
  He pressed a worn leather satchel into her hands—heavier than it looked. “Supplies.
  Tea. A few things that might help. And this.” He slid a folded parchment across
  the counter, a sketch of the forest’s lesser paths, marked with symbols she recognized
  from her grandmother’s notes. “You’re not a hero. You’re a scholar with a map. That’s
  enough.”


  Elena stared at the compass, then at the forest beyond the glass. The doubt still
  gnawed at her, but for the first time, it felt less like a scream and more like
  a whisper. She could leave. She could walk away. But the thought no longer made
  her chest ache the way it had the night before.


  Marcus watched her, then reached for a teacup behind the counter. “You’ll need this
  more than I will.” He poured her a cup of something dark and spiced. “Drink up.
  The forest’s got a long memory.”'
