output: 'Tomás hauled Zara through a slit between two spice stalls and into a service
  corridor that smelled of damp clay. Behind them, the market’s roar thinned into
  muffled echoes, replaced by the slap of hurried boots and the hissed clicks of Scorpion
  Guild signalers. Torchlight skipped along the walls as Tomás ducked under a beam
  etched with old chalk marks—scholar’s notation, not merchant’s tally.


  “This passage was part of the cistern works,” he said. “Older than the bazaar. Fewer
  eyes.”


  “Fewer,” Zara muttered, because no eyes at all meant something else was watching:
  mechanisms, the kind people forgot until they took your fingers.


  They reached a rusted gate half swallowed by mineral crust. Beyond it, a narrow
  stairwell plunged into the earth at an angle that made her stomach tilt. Tomás fumbled
  with the latch, hands trembling.


  “You said they don’t know about it,” she whispered.


  “They don’t,” he said. “But the builders did.”


  A dull thud sounded above—someone trying doors, hitting walls. Tomás shoved the
  gate; it squealed, and the sound felt like a flare. Zara slipped past him and knelt
  at the hinge where an iron pin held the thing together. The lock wasn’t meant to
  keep honest people out; it was meant to slow frightened ones down.


  Her fingers found the seam, traced the grit, and she slid her knife tip into the
  crusted groove. A twist, a patient pry. The pin shifted with a soft give. She pulled
  it free and the gate swung wider, silent now, obedient as a lie.


  Tomás stared at her hands. “You do that like it’s breathing.”


  “It is,” she said, and started down.


  The stairwell tightened into a tunnel where the air tasted of old coins. A series
  of carved stone blocks formed the floor—too regular, too clean of dust. Zara halted,
  lifting her foot mid-step.


  “Don’t,” she said.


  Tomás nearly collided with her back. “What?”


  She crouched, ran her fingertips along a narrow slit between stones. “Pressure plates.
  See how the sand avoids them? Something sweeps it away.”


  Tomás swallowed. “There’s no other route.”


  “There’s always a route,” Zara said, though the words felt like an old prayer she
  no longer trusted. She pulled a copper bead from her pocket—one of the last from
  the market’s pickings—and rolled it forward. It clicked onto the first stone. Nothing.


  She rolled it again. On the third block, a faint tremor answered; from the wall
  ahead, a row of needle-holes sighed and spat a dart that clattered harmlessly against
  the opposite stone.


  Tomás flinched hard enough to crack his shoulder against the tunnel. “Maker.”


  Zara’s mouth went dry. “Follow my steps. Exactly.”


  She moved with a thief’s measured certainty, reading the floor the way she once
  read crowds: where weight lingered, where absence meant danger. Behind them, the
  Guild’s pursuit grew louder, metal scraping above as someone found the gate.


  Halfway across, Tomás’s boot slipped off her indicated edge and settled full on
  a plate.


  The tunnel inhaled.


  Zara lunged, grabbing his sleeve and yanking him forward as the wall spat. A dart
  buried itself in the stone where his throat had been. Another grazed Zara’s arm,
  a bright sting, not deep, but enough to remind her how cheap her body was to this
  place.


  At the far end, a round door waited—stone, seamless except for a ring-shaped indentation.
  Tomás pressed his palm there, and it did nothing.


  “What are you doing?” Zara hissed. “Open it.”


  “I can’t,” he said, voice thin. He looked over his shoulder at the tunnel they’d
  crossed. “The mechanism—”


  Above, the gate shrieked again. A scorpion-hooded silhouette filled the stair mouth,
  then another. Zara’s mind leapt to the simplest salvation: slam the round door,
  wedge it, run on alone if she could. Tomás was the reason they’d been found twice;
  Tomás was a weight she didn’t have to carry.


  His eyes met hers. Not pleading. Ashamed. “Zara. I know how it sounds, but I need
  to be inside. I need what’s in the Library.”


  “I need it too,” she said, and heard the lie in her own voice. She needed a cure.
  He needed something else.


  “Your mother,” Tomás said softly, as if naming it hurt him. “I’m not pretending
  I’m here for her. I’m here because the Sunken Library holds the original ledger
  of the Sand Kings’ treaties—the proof that my work wasn’t heresy. They stripped
  my title, burned my papers. If I bring that ledger to the Council, they can’t deny
  me.”


  The confession landed like a stone in her gut. All the talk of routes and rescue—he’d
  been walking his own path, and she’d been convenient.


  Zara’s hand tightened on her knife. The Scorpion Guild’s boots thundered closer.
  She could leave him, take the map, vanish back into Vel’kara’s veins. Safer. Smarter.
  Her mother’s face rose uninvited, sunken eyes and a breath that rattled like dice
  in a cup. If Zara failed, there would be no second try. No heroic last-minute bargain.
  Just a grave and an empty room.


  Failure wasn’t a blade; it was time running out.


  Tomás’s fingers found a small recess beneath the door ring. He tried to fit his
  signet—cracked and tarnished—into it, and it didn’t align. He cursed under his breath,
  panic turning his scholar’s care into clumsy force.


  Zara breathed once, forced herself to see details instead of fear. The recess wasn’t
  for a ring. It was a lock, disguised by pride. She slid in beside him, ignoring
  his startled glance, and worked her knife tip into a hairline seam. A hidden tumbler
  caught; she lifted, listening with her skin. One pin, then another. The door shuddered
  as if waking.


  The first Scorpion Guild member dropped into the tunnel behind them, crossbow raised.


  The stone door ground open just wide enough for a body. Tomás grabbed Zara’s uninjured
  arm. “Now!”


  She shoved him through first. For a heartbeat she could have stepped back and let
  the door close on him, let the Guild have their scholar, buy herself time. Her muscles
  even tensed to do it.


  Instead, she hooked her fingers into his collar and hauled herself after him. The
  door slammed shut as a bolt thudded from the other side, and darkness swallowed
  the noise of pursuit.


  They stood in pitch black air that tasted like flooded parchment. Zara took one
  step and her boot sank into water.


  Then the floor vanished.


  Cold swallowed her whole, dragging her down. She fought, flailing, but there was
  nothing to grab—only the weight of her own clothes and the panic that screamed she’d
  brought herself here, stupidly loyal, stupidly hopeful. Water filled her nose; the
  world narrowed to a single thought: if she dies here, her mother dies alone.


  She stopped fighting.


  In the stillness, she felt it: a current, gentle but insistent, pulling toward an
  unseen opening. She let it take her, made herself small, let go of the need to win
  by force. Her lungs burned; her mind flickered, a candle in a jar.


  Something hard scraped her shoulder—stone. She kicked once, twice, and her head
  broke the surface in a low chamber where faint light seeped from cracks in the ceiling
  like diluted dawn. She coughed water and air, alive in a way that felt borrowed.


  Tomás surfaced nearby, choking, spluttering, then laughing once—raw and disbelieving.
  He crawled onto a slick ledge, and Zara followed, shivering, arm bleeding faintly,
  but upright.


  For a moment she simply sat, water streaming from her hood, and listened to her
  heartbeat. It sounded different—less like a drum of panic, more like a metronome.
  She had not conquered the dark by striking it; she had survived by yielding, by
  trusting her own reading of a hidden world.


  When she rose, she rose changed: not softer, not kinder, but clearer. She would
  help Tomás only as long as it served her purpose, and she would not confuse hope
  with blind trust again.


  Ahead, an arched corridor sloped downward. The walls were carved with catalog marks
  and warnings in multiple scripts. At the threshold lay three figures in scorpion-marked
  cloaks, soaked and unmoving, their crossbows twisted, their faces pressed to the
  stone as if they’d been crawling toward sanctuary too late.


  Tomás stared, then looked back at the sealed door behind them. “They can’t have
  come through there.”


  Zara’s gaze dropped to the floor. Fresh footprints—bare, smaller than hers—ran from
  the bodies into the corridor, and beside them, the edge of her stolen map, torn
  clean from her vest and dragged away into the dark.'
