output: "Thomas leaned forward, his voice steady but urgent as he began his direct\
  \ examination of Dr. Okonkwo. In the hushed courtroom, every word rippled through\
  \ the tension. “Doctor, please recount your experience at Meridian’s research division,\
  \ and the undeniable truth behind the suppressed data,” he intoned. His gaze was\
  \ unwavering—a silent beckoning for her to stand with truth despite the weight bearing\
  \ on her conscience. For a long moment, Dr. Okonkwo’s eyes flickered; doubt clouded\
  \ their depths. The room held its breath as she clutched the documents close, and\
  \ it seemed, for an excruciating heartbeat, that she would recant the testimony\
  \ that had already sealed the case against Meridian. \n\nHer trembling voice began\
  \ with halting phrases, the first hints of recantation evident when she whispered,\
  \ “I… I am not sure if…” But Thomas interrupted with a decisive clarity that brooked\
  \ no further hesitation. “Doctor, I understand the personal cost, I understand the\
  \ burden of your actions,” he said softly, yet firmly. “But think of those seventeen\
  \ lives lost – their voices demand justice. Your truth can’t be swayed by fear or\
  \ personal anguish.” \n\nThe weight of his words shifted the air. Her gaze slid\
  \ from the papers to his resolute face, each word cutting through her internal conflict.\
  \ Thomas edged forward, sliding a photograph of the memorial for the fallen—a reminder\
  \ that every stone in the pathway to truth bore the names of those who could never\
  \ speak for themselves. “By standing firm, you not only honor them, but you also\
  \ secure a future for your daughter,” he added, the implications crystallizing in\
  \ the stillness that enveloped the courtroom. \n\nIn that charged moment, Dr. Okonkwo’s\
  \ resolve began to solidify. Her hand trembled visibly as she reached for the microphone.\
  \ With a deep, shuddering breath, she declared, “I will not recant. I affirm every\
  \ word.” The courtroom erupted in a mix of murmurs and relief. Thomas exhaled slowly,\
  \ aware that his decisive intervention had shifted the balance irrevocably towards\
  \ truth, marking the turning point in the trial where justice, painful though it\
  \ might be, finally prevailed."
