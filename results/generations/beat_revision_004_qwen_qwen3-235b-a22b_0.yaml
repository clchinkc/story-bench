output: "Detective Rachel Torres adjusted the angle of the crime board photo with\
  \ a dry-erase marker, the faint smudges of ink on her sleeve matching the shadows\
  \ under her eyes. Her fingers lingered on a decade-old case file as Detective James\
  \ Oyelaran placed a steaming paper cup beside her keyboard. \"Black, two sugars,\"\
  \ he said, nodding at the untouched mug from yesterday’s shift still parked by her\
  \ keyboard. \n\nShe smirked without looking up. \"You ever forget that's my order?\"\
  \ \n\n\"Would've brought three coffees if I thought it'd make you stop re-filing\
  \ cold cases at 6 a.m.\" He flicked a glance at the board—*Hawthorne, 2012*—where\
  \ her red circles connected a thread no one else had chased. \n\nThe Riverside Precinct\
  \ hummed behind them: the clatter of patrol reports, the sour tang of disinfectant\
  \ from the locker room, and somewhere beyond the glass walls, a man in a tailored\
  \ coat arguing with a uniformed officer about a stolen watch. \n\nAt her desk, Rachel’s\
  \ phone buzzed—a notification from the precinct app showing a Queens apartment complex’s\
  \ address. She tapped it, the screen illuminating a photo of her living room: the\
  \ same case files stacked on her coffee table, a cat paw smudged print on a surveillance\
  \ photo. Sherlock sat primly atop the fridge, tail flicking as he watched her microwave\
  \ a lone burrito. The microwave beeped. She yawned. \n\nA patrol car’s radio crackle\
  \ outside punctured the quiet. \"You notice,\" James said, \"every time we catch\
  \ a break, someone from 3rd Avenue reports a smashed Lexus window?\" He tossed her\
  \ a department report—the third burglary this month in a three-block radius. \n\n\
  Rachel stood, her chair scraping against linoleum as she clipped her badge to her\
  \ belt. Sherlock’s adoption tag jingled faintly in the photo on her desk, the one\
  \ taken at the 2017 arson scene where he’d pawed at a surviving ledger page. She’d\
  \ never told anyone how the kitten’s burned whiskers reminded her of her father’s\
  \ old mutt, or how the case had gone cold while she buried herself in work after\
  \ the breakup. \n\nRain misted the windows as the precinct clock ticked toward 8:00\
  \ a.m. Rachel reached for her coat. \n\n\"Tuesday’s going to be a long one,\" James\
  \ muttered, already scanning her latest Hawthorne board notes. \n\nOutside, October\
  \ leaves skittered across the sidewalk like unanswered questions."
