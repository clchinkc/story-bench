  The storm rolled in just after midnight, turning the Mediterranean into a churning
  black mirror. Maya had been awake for hours, restless, the weight of the contract
  pressing against her ribs like a too-tight corset. She’d spent the evening preparing
  *arroz negro*—black rice, the dish her abuela swore could cure any sorrow. The squid
  ink stained her fingers, her apron, the edges of her thoughts. She told herself
  it was just another meal, but the truth was, she’d made it for him.


  Alejandro had been avoiding the kitchen since her first week—Lucia delivered his
  meals on a silver tray, as if he were a prisoner in his own home. But tonight, the
  power flickered, then died. The villa groaned in the dark, and Maya lit candles,
  their flames casting long shadows over the countertops. She was stirring the rice
  when she heard the study door creak open.


  He stood in the doorway, his silhouette sharp against the dim light. No suit jacket,
  no polished shoes—just a rumpled shirt, sleeves rolled to the elbows, as if he’d
  been caught mid-fight with his own demons. “The generator’s out,” he said, voice
  rough. “Lucia’s gone to check.”


  Maya didn’t look up. “You could’ve sent someone else.”


  “I didn’t want to wait.”


  A beat of silence. The rice hissed in the pan.


  “You’re cooking,” he observed, stepping closer. The scent of garlic and smoked paprika
  curled between them.


  “For you.” The words slipped out before she could stop them. She braced for the
  shutters to come down, for him to turn and leave. But he didn’t.


  Instead, he exhaled, slow and unsteady, like a man surfacing from deep water. “I
  haven’t had *arroz negro* since I was a boy.” His fingers twitched at his sides,
  as if he wanted to reach for something but didn’t dare. “My mother used to make
  it. Before the—” He cut himself off, jaw tightening.


  Maya set the spoon down. “Before what?”


  The candlelight flickered across his face, carving out the lines of old pain. “Before
  the accident. The one that ended my career.” His laugh was bitter. “You think I’m
  difficult now? You should’ve seen me then. I broke three plates that night. Threw
  them against the wall like a child.”


  She should’ve let it go. Should’ve served the rice and sent him back to his study.
  But the way he stood there, half in shadow, half in light—it undid her. “What happened?”


  He hesitated. Then, quietly: “I was driving. My father was in the passenger seat.
  We argued. I lost control.” His voice cracked. “He walked away with a broken arm.
  I walked away with a torn ACL and a lifetime of headlines calling me reckless.”


  Maya’s chest ached. She reached for his hand without thinking. His fingers were
  cold, but he didn’t pull away. “You were grieving,” she said. “Not reckless.”


  His thumb brushed over her knuckles, just once. “No one’s ever said that to me.”


  The moment stretched, fragile as spun sugar. Then the lights flickered back on,
  harsh and sudden. Alejandro blinked, as if waking from a dream, and stepped back.
  But the damage was done—the walls had cracked.


  Maya turned off the stove. “Sit down.”


  “Maya—”


  “Sit.” She dished the rice onto two plates, the black grains glistening under the
  light. “You’re eating with me. No Lucia. No contracts. Just this.”


  He hesitated. Then, slowly, he pulled out a chair.


  As they ate in silence, the storm raging outside, Maya made her choice. She wasn’t
  staying for the money anymore. She was staying for the man who flinched at the mention
  of his mother’s cooking, who carried his guilt like a second skin. For the first
  time, she let herself hope that maybe—just maybe—she could be the one to help him
  set it down.'
