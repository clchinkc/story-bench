output: 'Yuki''s footsteps echoed through the deserted corridors as she methodically
  searched the station. She began in the crew quarters, where personal belongings
  lay scattered, as if the occupants had vanished mid-activity. In the mess hall,
  unfinished meals had congealed on the tables, utensils still clutched in hands that
  were now absent. The air was stale, but life support hummed quietly, maintaining
  a comfortable atmosphere.


  In the medical bay, she found the first log entry from Dr. Patel: "Subject 14表现出异常的细胞再生能力..."
  The entry trailed off, and the screen flickered with an error message. Yuki''s curiosity
  piqued; she continued to the next room.


  The lab was in disarray, equipment smashed, and samples shattered on the floor.
  Amidst the chaos, a log on a damaged console displayed a frantic message from Commander
  Reyes: "We''ve contained the anomaly...for now. The dimensional resonance is...it''s
  calling to them." Yuki''s eyes narrowed; she wasn''t sure what to make of it.


  As she turned to leave, a shadow darted across her peripheral vision. She spun around,
  but there was no one there. Suddenly, the lights flickered, and the air seemed to
  ripple. Figures coalesced, their faces distorted, eyes black as voids. Yuki froze,
  her heart racing. The figures lunged, their movements jerky and unnatural. She raised
  her scanner, and the energy emission seemed to startle them; they recoiled, momentarily.


  Yuki took advantage of the reprieve to make a run for the exit, slamming the door
  shut behind her. She leaned against the bulkhead, catching her breath. The encounter
  left her with more questions than answers. She accessed the station''s internal
  sensors, mapping the areas with the most unusual energy readings. Lab Seven was
  at the top of the list. With a deep breath, she set off towards it, her determination
  renewed. The mystery was far from solved, but she was getting closer.'
