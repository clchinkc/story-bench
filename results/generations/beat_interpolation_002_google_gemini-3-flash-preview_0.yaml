output: "Sarah stared at the photo until the edges blurred. Recanting was the path\
  \ of least resistance. A few sentences of perjured testimony and Amy would be home.\
  \ But Sarah knew the Marchetti bloodline; they didn't leave witnesses, even cooperative\
  \ ones. If she lied, she lost her soul and likely still lost her sister. To recant\
  \ was to hand Marchetti a \"get out of jail free\" card and hope a killer kept his\
  \ word. It was a sucker's bet.\n\nShe met Detective Marcus Webb in the back of a\
  \ dim twenty-four-hour diner. When she slid the photo across the cracked laminate,\
  \ Marcus’s jaw tightened. \"We go to the Captain, Sarah. We pull the file on every\
  \ warehouse in the district and we kick doors until we find her. Official channels,\
  \ the right way.\"\n\n\"The right way gets her killed,\" Sarah hissed, her voice\
  \ a jagged blade. \"Marchetti has ears in the precinct. You saw the leak in the\
  \ narcotics raid last month. If I flag this, the mole alerts the compound before\
  \ the first cruiser leaves the lot. The moment a SWAT team assembles, Amy becomes\
  \ a liability they'll dispose of in a heartbeat.\"\n\n\"Then we go to the feds,\"\
  \ Marcus countered, his voice low and urgent. \"Don't do anything reckless. Your\
  \ duty is to the law, Sarah. You're a damn good cop. Don't throw that away for a\
  \ gamble.\"\n\n\"My duty is to my blood,\" she snapped. \n\nShe looked past Marcus,\
  \ spotting a dark sedan idling near a hydrant—the same car she’d seen near the courthouse\
  \ yesterday. It wasn't just the mob watching her; she felt the suffocating weight\
  \ of the department’s bureaucracy and the very real possibility that her own colleagues\
  \ were reporting her movements to the Marchettis. If she stayed within the lines,\
  \ she was predictable. If she followed protocol, she was a sitting duck.\n\nShe\
  \ realized then that as long as she wore the badge, she was tethered to a failing\
  \ system that couldn't protect its own. To save Amy and keep Marchetti behind bars,\
  \ she couldn't be a pawn. She had to be the player. The badge wasn't a shield anymore;\
  \ it was a target.\n\n\"I can't do it your way, Marcus,\" she said, sliding out\
  \ of the booth. \n\n\"Sarah, wait! If you walk out, I have to report this.\"\n\n\
  \"I know,\" she said, her mind already calculating the distance to the precinct.\
  \ \"That's why I'm leaving.\""
