output: 'The morning sun did nothing to warm the chill of dread settled in Elena’s
  stomach. She had intended to return the map to her grandmother’s attic and forget
  the whole spectral misunderstanding, but her feet betrayed her, carrying her instead
  to the Dusty Tome—the village curiosity shop she usually avoided because the sheer
  disorganization offended her cataloger’s soul.


  Inside, the air smelled of ozone and old parchment. Marcus, the proprietor, emerged
  from behind a stack of precarious crates. He was a man made of sharp angles and
  scars, leaning heavily on a cane carved from what looked suspiciously like dragon
  bone.


  "You’re late," he grunted, not looking up from a brass compass he was polishing.
  "The map usually drives people here by dawn."


  Elena blinked. "I didn''t bring the map. I’m not going."


  "Of course you aren''t. Not without supplies." Marcus limped over and shoved a worn
  leather satchel into her arms. It was heavy, smelling of sage and oil. "Take it."


  "I told the ghost, and I’m telling you," Elena said, trying to hand it back. "I
  organize fiction; I don’t live it. I have no skills for a quest."


  Marcus laughed, a sound like gravel crunching. "Skills? The last ''hero'' who marched
  into the Thornwood had a sword big enough to cleave a boulder. He lasted ten minutes
  because he tried to stab a riddle." He fixed her with a piercing stare. "The Wellspring
  doesn''t need a warrior, Elena. It needs someone who understands patterns. Someone
  who knows how to listen to stories and find the truth in the margins. You’ve spent
  your life organizing chaos into order. That is not ordinary. That is a weapon."


  He pressed the brass compass into her free hand. "This doesn''t point north. It
  points to intent. Don''t fight the forest; read it."


  Elena looked down at the compass, then at the heavy bag. The panic was still there,
  but beneath it, a small, stubborn curiosity had taken root. She wasn''t brave, but
  she was thorough. And leaving a story unfinished was the one thing a librarian could
  never endure.'
