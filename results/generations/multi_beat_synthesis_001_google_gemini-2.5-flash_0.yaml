output: 'The chill wind off Lake Michigan always carried echoes, but tonight, inside
  the Buckingham’s crumbling ballrooms, those echoes were solid. Dante traced the
  faint, shimmering grief that clung to a tarnished brass rail, a residue left by
  a woman a century dead. “It’s thin,” he muttered, more to himself than the figure
  who’d been shadowing him.


  “You see what you want to see, Reyes,” a voice cut through the dust motes. Lena,
  a sharp-edged Resonant with a knack for sensing anxieties, stepped from the shadows.
  Her eyes, the color of storm clouds, narrowed. “Rosa trusted you. Said your ‘sight’
  was rare. But you’re a ghost yourself, soaked in the city’s pain, just like you
  used to soak in… other things.”


  The barb hit home. Three years clean, but the ghost of the needle still pricked.
  “Rosa taught me to see past the noise,” Dante said, his voice level. “She taught
  me how to read the *absence* of emotion. What’s left when the killer drains it all
  away.” He pointed to a patch of air where Rosa’s final, vibrant despair should have
  been, but instead, there was only a chilling, colorless void. “That’s not just a
  lack. It’s a signature. A negative print. They leave a vacuum, not just an empty
  space.”


  Lena’s gaze intensified, less suspicion, more critical assessment. “Show me.” She
  led him to a hidden alcove, barely visible. “A Resonant named Elias was here last
  week. He spoke of a ‘whisperer’ among us, someone subtly corrupting the energy flows.”
  She paused, then pointed to a faint, sickly green shimmer near a loose floorboard.
  “Can you tell me what *that* is? It doesn’t feel right.”


  Dante knelt, extending a hand. The green flickered, a faint, sickly envy. But beneath
  it, almost imperceptible, was a fainter, colder current, like the void he’d found
  at Rosa’s site, masked. “It’s a misdirection,” he stated, standing. “Elias felt
  envy, yes, but someone *else* laid that emotion here, on top of something colder,
  something… familiar. The killer has an accomplice, Lena. Someone who can manipulate
  residual emotion to cover their tracks.” Lena’s expression shifted, a flicker of
  grudging respect replacing the distrust. “Alright, Reyes,” she conceded, her voice
  softer. “You see it. Now, what do we do about it?”


  The plan formed in the hushed intimacy of Lena’s hidden workshop, tucked deep within
  the hotel’s forgotten service tunnels. She spread out a crude map of the Buckingham’s
  lower levels, scarred with her notes on past Resonant gatherings and their emotional
  hotspots. “The killer preys on strong emotions, then drains them,” she mused, tapping
  a dark stain on the map. “This ‘void’ you see… it’s a perfect camouflage in a place
  like this, where energies are always shifting.”


  “It’s more than camouflage,” Dante corrected, his fingers tracing the contours of
  the map. “It’s a mirror. The killer isn’t just taking emotion; they’re leaving a
  void that echoes the emptiness I felt when I lost Sofia. Like a piece of your soul
  ripped out.” He clenched his jaw. Confronting this killer meant plumbing the depths
  of that old wound, the gaping hole his sister’s overdose had left. He’d buried that
  guilt under years of sobriety, but it was a raw nerve now. He needed to be strong,
  not just for Rosa, but for Sofia.


  Lena watched him, her gaze surprisingly soft. “You think that void is their weakness?”
  she asked, handing him a small, intricately carved obsidian shard. “This belonged
  to Rosa. She said it amplifies a Resonant’s focus, helps them cut through the noise.
  Maybe it can help you see past the killer’s mirror.”


  Dante ran his thumb over the cool, smooth stone. It felt heavy, not just with its
  physical weight, but with the memory of Rosa’s touch. Taking on this killer meant
  facing not just a physical threat, but a psychological one that tapped into his
  deepest fears. He remembered the hollow ache after Sofia’s death, the feeling of
  utter helplessness. Could he stand against a force that inflicted that same desolation
  on others? He took a deep, shuddering breath. “It’s time,” he said, his voice rough
  but resolute. Together, they descended into the Buckingham’s true heart – the forgotten
  sub-basements, where the city’s oldest, darkest emotional residues festered, a labyrinth
  of shadows and chilling silence.


  The sub-basement air hung thick with despair and ancient, forgotten rage. The void
  Dante had identified, the killer’s negative emotional signature, pulsed stronger
  here, a palpable chill that seeped into his bones. Lena moved with quiet urgency
  beside him, her hand gripping Rosa’s obsidian shard. Suddenly, the air crackled.
  A figure emerged from the gloom, tall and gaunt, their face obscured by a deep hood.
  “Reyes,” a voice hissed, devoid of warmth or inflection. “The boy who couldn’t save
  his sister. The addict who feeds on others’ pain.”


  The words struck Dante like a physical blow. The killer’s void pulsed, and Dante
  felt a familiar, suffocating emptiness spread through him, a phantom pain in his
  chest. He saw Sofia’s pale face, felt the crushing weight of his helplessness as
  she slipped away. His vision blurred, the world narrowing to that final, agonizing
  moment. He was paralyzed, lost in the echo of his past failure. Lena cried out as
  the killer moved, a shadowy tendril reaching for her.


  All seemed lost. Dante was drowning in guilt, the killer’s power amplified by his
  own internal torment. But then, through the haze, he saw it: the killer’s void wasn’t
  just an absence, it was a *reflection*. A mirror of the very pain it inflicted.
  And within that reflection, he saw not Sofia’s death, but Rosa’s final, defiant
  spark, the lingering trace of her strength he’d learned to discern. He remembered
  her words, echoing in his mind: *“The absence isn’t empty, Dante. It’s a place for
  something new.”*


  The obsidian shard in his hand vibrated. He squeezed it, accepting the truth: his
  guilt was real, a part of him, but it didn’t have to define him. It could be a source
  of understanding, a window into the killer’s own profound emptiness. He focused,
  not on fighting the killer’s power, but on *seeing* its source, on projecting his
  own hard-won sobriety, his acceptance of loss, into that reflected void. The killer
  faltered, a flicker of confusion crossing their features as Dante’s focused resolve,
  honed by years of battling his own demons, cut through the emotional vacuum. It
  wasn’t strength that broke the killer’s hold, but a profound understanding of their
  shared, yet vastly different, emptiness.'
