  Maya had spent weeks mapping Alejandro Vega’s schedule, his moods, the way he flinched
  when asked about his career. She knew him as a man of routine—breakfast at seven,
  no guests after dinner, a daily bottle of wine at six. But tonight, the study doors
  were open, and the scent of garlic and slow-braised meat drifted through the villa’s
  marble halls. That’s when she saw him.


  He wasn’t on his balcony, where the tabloids loved to photograph him, brooding and
  distant. He was in the kitchen, sleeves rolled up, a knife in hand. The golden lamplight
  caught the scars on his forearms—old, pale lines that told their own story. He was
  peeling the skin off a lemon with the precision of someone who’d done it a thousand
  times, but his thumb slipped, drawing a thin line of blood. Maya froze in the doorway,
  half-expecting him to turn and find her spying, but he didn’t. Instead, he pressed
  the wound to his lips, as if tasting it, and then continued.


  “You’re supposed to be preparing supper,” she said softly, stepping inside.


  He didn’t look up. “I need something else.”


  The refrigerator was half-empty, as usual. She turned to the pantry, where his private
  stock lay—wines she’d never been allowed to touch, spices imported from places she’d
  only read about. “What then?”


  “The other bottle of *Lagar*." His voice was rough. “The one from ’98.”


  Maya’s breath caught. The ’98 wine was the vintage he’d won the World Cup with.
  The one he never mentioned, never allowed near the table. “You’re sure?”


  Alejandro finally met her eyes, and for the first time, she saw something unguarded.
  “No.”


  She uncorked it anyway, the deep amber scent filling the air. He watched her pour,
  his jaw tight, as if the ritual itself pained him. Then he lifted the glass, swirling
  the wine before drinking—not the quick, efficient sip she’d grown accustomed to,
  but a slow, deliberate taste. When he lowered it, his gaze lingered on hers.


  “Tell me about it,” he said.


  Maya hesitated. The wine was sacred. His past, his solitude, all of it. But the
  way he leaned against the counter, the knife still resting in his hand as if he’d
  forgotten it—this was a crack in the armor she’d come to fear.


  She exhaled, the story spilling out like she hadn’t meant to. “My grandmother—she
  used to grow lemons in the garden behind the restaurant. Said they tasted like the
  sun. But the *Lagar*? It’s not just wine. It’s time. The night you won. The sweat
  on your skin, the hands that held you up afterward.” She paused, realizing she’d
  stopped talking to the contract, to the salary, to the restaurant. She was talking
  to *him*. “I once saw a man cry over food,” she added quietly. “Not tears. Just…
  his mouth trembling.”


  Alejandro set the glass down hard. The sound echoed like a gunshot. Then, without
  a word, he reached for the knife she’d been using for his usual meat preparation.
  His fingers brushed hers, and she didn’t pull away. He turned it, the blade catching
  the light, and slid it along his palm—just enough to draw a line, just like with
  the lemon. Blood welled. He pressed it to her lips.


  “Now you,” he said.


  Maya’s pulse hammered in her throat. She could refuse. She could step back, call
  this a breach, a moment to be erased. But the way he watched her, as if she were
  the only person in the villa who understood him—not the cameras, not the fans, not
  the money—*her*. She pressed her thumb to the cut, wincing at the sting, and brought
  it to her mouth. The taste was metallic, warm. His eyes darkening, Alejandro lifted
  her wrist, his breath hot against her skin as he licked the blood away.


  The air between them thickened, charged. For the first time since signing that contract,
  Maya didn’t count the days. She counted the *moments*—the way his voice had softened
  when she spoke of her grandmother’s lemons, the way his guard had slipped just enough
  for her to catch it. Six months had never seemed so long. Or so short.


  She would stay. Not for the salary, not for the dream of a bigger kitchen. For this—whatever
  it was, whatever it might become. For the way he looked at her now, like a man who’d
  been starved of something, and she was the first bite of food he’d let himself taste
  in years.'
