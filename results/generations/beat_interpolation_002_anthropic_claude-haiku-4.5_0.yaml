output: 'Sarah sat in her apartment, the envelope on her kitchen table. The photograph
  of Amy stared up at her. Her hand hovered over her phone. She could end this nightmare
  right now. Walk into court Monday and say she was mistaken. Say the lighting in
  the warehouse was poor, her memory faulty. Vincent Marchetti walks free, her sister
  walks out of that warehouse, and life continues.


  Except it wouldn''t. The Marchetti family didn''t release hostages out of goodwill.
  Amy would become a liability—a witness to her own kidnapping. Sarah had seen enough
  crime scenes to know exactly what happened to liabilities.


  She called Marcus instead.


  They met at the diner near the precinct, a place too public for moles. Marcus listened
  while she framed it cautiously—a possible threat connected to the trial, needing
  advice on how to protect someone close to her.


  "We''ll get protection," Marcus said immediately. His earnest blue eyes held absolute
  conviction. "Captain Morrison will put your family in protective custody. The state
  police can coordinate with us, maybe even the feds. This is exactly what resources
  exist for."


  Sarah wanted to believe him. Marcus was good people, one of the few genuine cops
  left in the department. But she asked the question she already knew the answer to:
  "Get protection through who, exactly? Who in this department can we absolutely trust?"


  Marcus''s silence was answer enough. They both knew. Corruption in the Marchetti
  family''s pocket ran deep—at least three detectives, possibly more. The FBI coordination
  would take weeks of bureaucratic delays that Marchetti owned people to obstruct.
  Her sister didn''t have weeks.


  Back in her apartment, Sarah made a list. Recant: Amy dies later, her testimony
  dies now, Marchetti walks. Official channels: too slow, too compromised, too many
  variables she couldn''t control. Both meant surrendering agency to a system already
  corrupted from the inside.


  There was only one option left. One requiring her to stop being a cop and start
  being something else entirely. Something operating outside rules, outside procedures,
  outside channels that criminals had already penetrated.


  The realization didn''t feel like defeat. It felt like clarity. Sarah had been waiting
  unconsciously for the system to fail her, waiting for permission to break the rules.


  Now she had it.'
