output: 'Her scanner pinged softly as she moved through the crew quarters, the dim
  red lights smearing reflections across neatly made bunks and abandoned sleeves of
  clothing. Coffee lay in a thin skin at the bottom of a mug, evaporated to a tacky
  ring. On a wall, a half-finished chess game levitated in her mind’s eye as position
  notations on a tablet blinked their last battery bars. No signs of panic. People
  had simply... stopped.


  A chill lifted the hairs along her arms. The air pressure dipped, subtle but measurable;
  her scanner’s spectrum analyzer fuzzed with a high-frequency hiss she couldn’t attribute
  to machinery. “Hello?” she tried again, quieter, like sound might fracture whatever
  held this place together. In the corner of her vision, something wavered—a distortion
  like light crossing hot metal. When she turned, it vanished, leaving a smell like
  ozone and cold iron.


  She forced herself onward to Medical. The door was sealed with a flashing “biohazard:
  quarantine.” Yuki linked her tablet to the panel, isolated the thermistor array
  from the system bus, and spoofed a clean readout. The lock clunked, and she shouldered
  through.


  Med bay was organized to the point of tenderness: labeled vials, folded linens,
  a centrifuge mid-cycle, paused. On a screen, a paused recording—Commander Reyes,
  eyes rimmed in sleepless red. “Trial cohort Cleo/Phase—” Static. Yuki scrubbed through
  the waveform and spliced two fragments. “Field three... oscillation drift... if
  we can anchor the protocol, it holds. Data core... Lab Seven.” She exhaled, slow.
  Kronin’s Disease noted on charts, pre- and post-therapy biomarkers trending toward
  remission. Another note in Reyes’s handwriting: “Phase stabilization window narrows
  with cumulative exposure.”


  The temperature dropped again. The glass of an empty tank hazed with breath that
  wasn’t hers. Shapes accreted in the corners—humanoid lengths where the light bent
  wrong. As they pressed nearer, her skin prickled, the pins-and-needles of the teleporter
  returning. A whisper threaded the ventilators, syllables almost forming. She backed
  into the supply bay, flipped her scanner into active mode, and pulsed a broad-spectrum
  calibration burst. The hiss spiked, the distortions shuddered, and the room’s air
  normalized by a fraction. Not gone—just repelled.


  The corridor to the labs was barred by a radiation-lockdown bulkhead. The Geiger
  logs read like nonsense—white noise. Yuki patched in, injected a reference curve,
  and watched the alarm reset. Cold resolve settled in. The pattern was clear enough
  to chase: a breakthrough that touched the wrong layer of reality, and the proof
  of it anchored where Reyes had said. She headed for Lab Seven.'
