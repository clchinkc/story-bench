output: 'The apartment was dark when Maya unlocked the door. She didn''t bother with
  the lights. What was the point? The gallery had closed this morning. Twenty years
  of her mother''s legacy, reduced to "LEASE AVAILABLE" signs.


  She sank onto the floor by the window, still in her coat. The city lights blurred—or
  maybe that was tears. She''d tried everything. The crowdfunding fell short. The
  investors walked. Even her brother stopped answering.


  Her mother''s last painting hung opposite, barely visible in the darkness. A woman
  walking toward an unseen horizon. Maya remembered the hospice room, holding her
  mother''s hand, promising she''d keep the gallery alive. "It''s not about the art,"
  her mother had whispered. "It''s about a place where people feel something real."


  Maya had broken that promise. Failed her mother. Failed herself.


  She pulled her knees to her chest and sat in the silence. Outside, the city kept
  moving—cars, sirens, life continuing. But here, time had stopped. No calls left
  to make. No plans. Just the weight of loss pressing down on her chest.


  Tomorrow she''d figure out what comes next. Tonight, she let herself break.'
