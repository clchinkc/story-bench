output: "The tunnel spat them into darkness so thick Zara’s fingers brushed stone\
  \ on both sides. Tomás lit a shard of phosphorite, revealing a cavern floor riddled\
  \ with pressure plates—rusty blades jutting from cracks. “Stay behind me,” she hissed,\
  \ crouching to trace the mechanisms. Years of prying open locked chests in the capital’s\
  \ slums taught her to see the trap’s rhythm. She inched forward, her knife probing\
  \ until she found the fulcrum. A flick of her wrist disengaged the first blade.\
  \  \n\n“Move,” she ordered, guiding Tomás across the path she’d cleared. But as\
  \ he stepped, a plate shifted. A net of iron spikes surged upward, grazing his calf.\
  \ He stumbled, blood darkening his boot. Zara froze. The Scorpion Guild’s shouts\
  \ echoed from behind.  \n\n“You’ll slow us down,” she said, the words sharper than\
  \ she intended.  \n\n“And you’ll never navigate the Approach without me,” Tomás\
  \ gritted out.  \n\nShe cursed, hauling him up. The tunnel ahead narrowed into a\
  \ crawl space.  \n\nThey emerged into a cavern where the ground dropped into a bottomless\
  \ chasm. A series of stone bridges crumbled into the void, leaving only a frayed\
  \ rope bridge. “The Approach’s final test,” Tomás panted.  \n\nZara’s stomach knotted.\
  \ Heights had haunted her since a childhood fall left her with a scarred knee. But\
  \ Tomás’s weight leaned heavier against her.  \n\nA thud echoed behind them. The\
  \ Guild had breached the crawl space.  \n\nShe shoved Tomás toward the bridge. “Cross.”\
  \  \n\nHe hesitated. “Zara—”  \n\n“Move!”  \n\nThe first Scorpion lunged. Zara flung\
  \ her knife, burying it in the man’s shoulder. She scrambled onto the bridge, ropes\
  \ biting her palms as it swayed. Halfway across, Tomás screamed. A second bridge,\
  \ hidden in shadows, collapsed—intentionally timed. The Scorpions roared, cut off\
  \ by the chasm.  \n\nOn the far side, Zara dragged Tomás behind a pillar. His face\
  \ was ash. “Why did you tell them where we’d be?” she demanded, remembering his\
  \ whispered conversation hours earlier.  \n\nHe flinched. “I owed them a debt. I\
  \ thought if I led them here, they’d let me pass unbothered.”  \n\nHer knife pressed\
  \ to his throat before she could think. “You used me?”  \n\n“I needed you alive\
  \ to get this far.” His voice wavered. “But I’ll help you inside the Library. Swear\
  \ it.”  \n\nThe confession curdled her gut, but the Scorpions were regrouping. She\
  \ sheathed her blade. “Walk.”  \n\nThey entered a vaulted chamber where water dripped\
  \ from stalactites, forming a pool that reflected the ceiling’s ancient carvings.\
  \ Tomás limped to a pedestal where a cracked astrolabe rotated. “This unlocks the\
  \ final door,” he said.  \n\nA rumble shook the chamber. The carvings depicted a\
  \ goddess drowning her kingdom—a warning. The pool began to rise, swallowing their\
  \ ankles.  \n\n“Turn it!” Zara shouted.  \n\n“I can’t—it’s jammed.”  \n\nShe shoved\
  \ him aside, fingers dancing over the astrolabe’s gears. Water reached her waist.\
  \ The thief’s patience clicked in: find the weakness. Her nail caught a hairline\
  \ fracture in the outer ring. She jammed her pick into it, twisting. The gears groaned,\
  \ and the pool drained, revealing a stairway beneath.  \n\nTomás stared. “How?”\
  \  \n\n“Streets taught me locks break easier when you know where to crack ’em,”\
  \ she spat.  \n\nThe stairs led to a sealed door. As Tomás traced sigils on it,\
  \ Zara’s mind churned. He’d manipulated her. Yet his hands trembled—not from fear,\
  \ she realized, but shame. His betrayal was cowardice, not malice. She’d trusted\
  \ him. Now she’d survive him.  \n\nThe door groaned open, revealing a vast chamber\
  \ where the ceiling sagged with roots. Tomás stumbled forward—but the ground gave\
  \ way. Zara lunged, catching his wrist as he dangled over a pit of black thorns.\
  \  \n\n“Let go!” he yelled. “I’ll be the only one dead!”  \n\nInstead, she hauled\
  \ him up, the thorns scraping her forearms raw. “You’re not worth the guilt,” she\
  \ muttered.  \n\nWhen he stood, he didn’t meet her eyes.  \n\nA pedestal stood in\
  \ the chamber’s heart, holding a single obsidian key. Zara reached for it—but the\
  \ room shuddered. The walls exhaled dust, then collapsed inward, burying the pedestal\
  \ in a landslide. She threw herself over Tomás, stone grazing her shoulder. Darkness\
  \ fell as the ceiling split open, letting a shaft of light strike the rubble. From\
  \ beneath the debris, the key glinted.  \n\nTomás gasped. “The Library’s protected.\
  \ Only those who defy death can pass.”  \n\nZara spat blood from her split lip.\
  \ “You mean those who survive because they’re willing to break.” She dug into the\
  \ rubble, muscles screaming, and pulled the key free.  \n\nThe ground stilled. A\
  \ hidden door slid open. But as they stepped through, her breath caught. The Sunken\
  \ Library loomed—a fortress of black stone, but its gates were barred by a dozen\
  \ armored sentinels.  \n\n“New problem,” Tomás whispered.  \n\nZara flexed her bruised\
  \ shoulder. The old Zara would’ve run, doubted her odds. But the girl who’d clawed\
  \ her way through traps and betrayal didn’t flinch. Her fear of failure had choked\
  \ her for years. Now it fueled her.  \n\n“Follow my lead,” she said, and charged."
