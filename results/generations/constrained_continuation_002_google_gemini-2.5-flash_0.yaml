output: 'Priya’s grin widened. “He called us a disaster. Clearly, he hasn’t tasted
  our Punjabi-Texas fusion.” She grabbed her phone, typing furiously. “Just added
  a comment: ‘Come taste the disaster, @HungryATX. We guarantee it’s delicious.’”


  A ripple of laughter, then a cheer, surged through the small crowd gathering near
  their truck. Someone had retweeted Priya’s reply, and the hashtag #TasteTheDisaster
  started trending locally. Soon, a line genuinely formed, not just out of pity, but
  curiosity. Dev, still skeptical, watched as the first adventurous soul ordered a
  "Spicy Paneer Brisket Taco."


  “Two hundred thousand followers, Priya,” Dev muttered, flipping a sizzling paneer
  slab. “Most of them probably hate-following.”


  “Doesn’t matter. They’re here.” Priya’s voice was a whirlwind of energy, taking
  orders, explaining the concept, and charming skeptical faces into trying their unique
  fare. The next few hours were pure pandemonium. They moved with a clumsy grace,
  Dev mastering the art of the quick sear and the perfect dollop of chutney, Priya
  a blur of orders and cash. They ran out of cilantro, then napkins, then finally,
  after a desperate dash to the nearest grocery store, out of paneer.


  As the last customer left, a sleek, chrome-plated truck with "Smokin'' Joe''s BBQ"
  emblazoned on its side pulled up across the lot. A burly man with an impressive
  mustache leaned out. “Looks like the circus came to town,” he drawled, eyeing their
  pink bus. “Heard you’re making a splash. Don’t think your little experiment will
  last long, though. This town likes *real* barbecue.” Joe winked at a passing pedestrian
  and drove off.


  Priya and Dev exchanged a look. Joe’s BBQ was an Austin institution, a previous
  championship winner. He was their Goliath.


  Over the next two weeks, the #TasteTheDisaster phenomenon exploded. Foodies flocked,
  influencers filmed, and their electric pink bus became a vibrant, unexpected landmark.
  They hired a part-timer, a college student named Maya, just to manage the growing
  queue. The money rolled in, a sweet symphony of cash register pings. One evening,
  after their busiest day yet, Dev pulled out a stack of crisp bills.


  “We actually did it, Priya,” he said, his voice laced with disbelief. “We’re profitable.
  In two weeks.”


  Priya leaned against the bus, exhaustion giving way to a triumphant glow. “Told
  you this was a winning recipe.” She met his gaze, a shared understanding passing
  between them. The endless nights, the arguments, the doubt – it had all culminated
  in this moment of genuine, hard-won success. They high-fived, a solid smack that
  echoed in the quiet lot.


  Then Dev’s phone buzzed. He glanced at it, his brow furrowing. “Joe just posted
  something. The Austin Food Truck Championship just announced its wildcard slot.
  And he challenged us directly for it.” A smug photo of Joe’s truck gleamed on the
  screen. “He said, ‘Let’s see if that pink monstrosity can handle the heat.’”'
