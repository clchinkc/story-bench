output: 'Priya moved like a caffeinated tornado, scooping spiced paneer onto smoked
  brisket-bunned tacos while Dev managed the register and shouted out orders to an
  ever-growing crowd. The lunch rush had descended like a locust swarm, and they were
  drowning in the best possible way.


  "Half and half on twelve!" Dev called, sliding another credit card through the reader.
  His earlier pessimism had transformed into frantic focus.


  "On it!" Priya flipped three tacos in the air, catching them with the kind of precision
  that surprised even her. Maybe quitting her engineering job hadn''t been insane
  after all.


  By two o''clock, they''d run out of everything. Priya stood in the empty kitchen,
  wiping her hands on her apron, while Dev counted what had to be the best four-hour
  revenue in East Austin food truck history.


  "We did it," he said, the disbelief in his voice matching the smile on his face.
  "We actually did it."


  Priya bumped her fist against his. "Told you. Austin isn''t ready for us? Austin
  doesn''t know what hit them."


  That''s when the horn sounded. Not a friendly honk—the aggressive, move-it-or-lose-it
  beep of someone claiming territory.


  A glossy black truck with chrome accents pulled into the lot beside them. The words
  "Smoke & Oak" were scripted across the side in elegant gold letters. A tall woman
  in a branded apron stepped out, surveying their location with the cold precision
  of a general surveying enemy lines.


  "Great," Dev muttered. "The Iron Oak Empire has arrived."


  Priya watched the woman—whose name tag read VICTORIA CHEN—begin setting up. "You
  know her?"


  "She owns four trucks. Won the championship two years running. She''s basically
  the reason everyone else shows up to lose."


  Victoria glanced over, offering a tight smile that somehow communicated both politeness
  and a threat. "Cute truck," she called out. "Love the pink. Very... bold."


  Priya felt Dev tense beside her. She placed a hand on his arm, the first intentional
  contact they''d shared all day. "Let her set up. We proved ourselves today."


  "For now," Dev said. "But the championship is in two weeks. She just found out we''re
  competition."


  The afternoon sun felt suddenly hotter. Priya looked at their empty serving window,
  at the line that had wrapped around the block, at the deposit they''d just earned.
  They were actually doing this.


  Her phone buzzed. A new email from the Food Truck Championship committee: "Congratulations
  on your qualification. Due to unprecedented interest, this year''s bracket has expanded.
  A new elimination round has been added: the Street Food Invitational, happening
  this Saturday. Eight trucks. Winner takes the final championship slot."


  Priya stared at the screen. Saturday. Three days. They hadn''t even finished their
  first week.


  Dev read over her shoulder. "That''s not possible. Nobody gets invited to the Invitational
  without at least six months of—"


  "We proved ourselves today," Priya repeated, but the words felt different now. Heavier.
  The victory she''d been savoring had just become something else entirely: a challenge
  they might not survive.


  She looked at the Smoke & Oak truck, at Victoria Chen already reviewing her own
  phone with narrowed eyes. The woman had received the same email. And she was already
  looking at Priya with an expression that said: I know what you are. And I know how
  this ends.


  "We need to talk about our numbers," Priya said quietly. "And figure out how the
  hell we''re going to scale this in three days."


  Dev nodded, the easy joy of their morning replaced by something sharper. "Partners?"


  "Partners."


  They shook on it, the gesture solidifying something that had only felt tentative
  before. Whatever came next, they would face it together—not as coworkers, not as
  almost-something, but as the only two people who believed in this strange, pink,
  paneer-taco dream.'
