output: 'The Buckingham still smelled like wet velvet and old secrets. Dante slid
  through the lobby’s skeleton, seeing the world in the way only he could: the air
  layered with brushstrokes of feeling, the carpet stiff with crackled amber rage,
  the chandeliers crying pale blue drips of once-sparkle joy. Rosa’s green—her teaching
  patient as spring—had been scrubbed from the walls where her body was found, but
  he could still see a faint halo where she’d laughed at his first clean year, where
  she’d smacked his shoulder and called him a stubborn artist.


  A clear note quivered through the ballroom. Dante froze. The sound wasn’t quite
  sound; it was a ripple in the lingering color, a tremor through old emotion. He
  followed it to the stage where a woman stood with a bent brass tuning fork in one
  hand and a face that could cut glass.


  “You Reyes?” she asked. The fork sang against her knuckle. Her brown eyes were all
  suspicion. “Lena. Rosa’s friend. She told me to keep my distance.”


  “She told everybody,” he said, mouth dry. He felt the sober coin in his pocket with
  his thumb, a cool edge to rub when the old hunger itched. Three years was nothing
  and everything.


  “She’s dead because someone sold us out.” Lena’s gaze flicked to the painted veils
  clinging to the proscenium like smoke. “Maybe the guy who shows up after disappearing
  for months.”


  He took it. He earned doubt. “I’m clean. I was with Rosa the night before. We were
  supposed to meet here, and—”


  The room took a breath. The colors thinned, pulled toward a point at the edge of
  the stage, a web of silver grief drawn taut. Trap. Dante saw the filaments glistening,
  plucked from what Rosa had left like someone had strung a harp of sorrow and set
  it to snap.


  “Move,” he said, and put his hand up like a crossing guard. He inhaled slow, letting
  the residue flood his vision without claiming it. He could almost taste salt and
  lemons. His heart galloped. He pressed the coin hard enough to hurt. In the old
  days, pressure meant the bottle or a baggie. Now it meant breathing through the
  urge.


  “Don’t touch anything,” he warned. “That line breaks and it floods us. It’ll drown
  you.”


  “What do we do?” Lena’s fork kept a nervous pulse, close to panic.


  He stepped into the color like stepping into rain. He stroked a trembling strand
  with the back of two fingers. “Name it,” he whispered, remembering Rosa’s voice.
  “Name and it loosens.” He saw her face reflected in the silver: not Rosa, his little
  sister, Ana, lips purple, eyes far away. He swallowed the guilt cutting up his throat
  and called the strand sorrow that loved, sorrow that stayed. It slackened under
  the recognition. He guided it aside, guiding others until a gap opened. “Come.”


  They slid past. The web settled again, harmless. Lena looked at him with new eyes.
  “Okay,” she said grudgingly. “You’re not the reason she died. But someone in here
  is. Hear that?” She cocked her head. There was a faint rasping in the wall’s residues,
  a sawtooth echo of someone scrubbing his own guilt raw. “Dori Kole,” she said. “The
  quartermaster. He always carries grease from the boiler room. It leaves a beige
  smear. And he hums when he lies. Fork picks it up.”


  Dante squinted. Beige guilt clung to the door to the service corridor like a greasy
  handprint. The color was wrong for the killer’s icy empty—this was familiar, domestic
  treachery.


  Lena’s mouth was a grim line. “We’ve got a rat. And a hunter who knows how to pluck
  us like strings.”


  He nodded, throat tight. If the killer had a path through their home, if Rosa had
  trusted the wrong person… The stakes shifted, heavier, from grief to danger. Dante
  slid the coin between forefinger and thumb until it chimed softly against the brass
  rail. It steadied him. “Then we go where the rat feeds the wolf.”


  They planned in a room with broken mirrors and a jukebox that hadn’t played since
  the eighties. Lena unfolded a hand-sketched map of the hotel’s guts. “Kole runs
  supplies through the old service tunnel, down to the sub-basement,” she said. “There’s
  a cistern down there, catches runoff from the river. That’s where the emotions pool
  when this place overflows. It’s a knot—perfect for a siphon to hook into.”


  Dante traced a line with a busted pen. The ink threw up little hues of his own focus,
  tight and dark. He pictured Rosa’s green being pulled into that hole. He pictured,
  uninvited, Ana on a tiled floor, the hiss of some stranger’s laughter from the next
  room. He hadn’t been there. He’d been on a bender. The killer’s taunting message
  from last night crept like a cold hand up his neck: I know the first color you ever
  refused to see.


  “He’s not just hunting Resonants,” Dante said. “He’s hunting what we can’t face.
  If I go in there, he’ll use her. He’ll—” He couldn’t say his sister’s name without
  tasting bile.


  Lena set the fork down. “Then we make it your choice, not his. We go to the cistern.
  We take his hook out of you. We use you as bait, but we go in tuned.” She slid the
  tuning fork over to him. “When you hit it on metal, it cuts through background.
  Clears noise. It’s not magic, it’s physics, but the line between is thin.”


  He held it. It was warm from her hand. It felt like an instrument and an oath. He
  set it beside his coin. “I’ve been tuning myself for three years,” he said. “Some
  days I want to drown anyway.”


  “What’s the alternative?” Lena’s eyes were soft now. “Let Kole sell the next kid?
  Let this place turn hollow?” She shoved a canvas bag over. Inside were chalks, a
  coil of rope, bolt cutters. “Pick your tools.”


  He packed the chalk, the cutters, the fork. He kept the coin in his palm, not pocket.
  He looked in the cracked mirror and saw a man who looked like he’d slept under rain.
  “If I see her,” he said, “I might not come back.”


  “Then I pull you. Or you pull yourself.” Lena touched the coin with a fingertip.
  “You kept this. You can keep yourself.”


  They descended through the laundry chute, down iron stairs that groaned like tired
  animals. The air cooled and thickened with minerals and memory. The walls sweated
  old fear. Dante chalked a line at the threshold. A symbolic thing, maybe silly,
  but his hands needed rituals. On the other side, the hall widened into a cavern
  under the hotel, the cistern a black oval. The residue down here wasn’t colors so
  much as weather—winds of sorrow, riptides of joy, all swirling around a center that
  felt like a mouth.


  He hesitated at the chalk line. His foot hovered. For a second he was back in an
  alley with a flame on a spoon and a decision. He trembled, and then he stepped over,
  feeling the floor give a little, as if agreeing to swallow him if he faltered.


  They didn’t see the killer at first. They saw Kole. He was tied to a pipe with his
  own belt, head lolling, beige guilt trickling from him. He lifted his face, split
  lip, and tried to smile. “Had to,” he croaked. “He takes it all. He promised he’d
  leave me empty.” His laugh was a hiccup. “I thought empty meant safe.”


  Then the air changed. The residue around the cistern flattened, like a field gone
  quiet before a train. A man stepped from the shadow of a column, middle-aged, accountant
  ordinary, eyes drained to slate. In his hand was a device that looked like a tuning
  fork mated with a scalpel.


  “Hello, Dante,” he said, and his voice tugged at everything tender. “You left your
  sister alone. Do you remember the color of her shame? I do.”


  Lena lifted her fork. He flicked his, and the sound drank hers. The siphon woke,
  pulling from the cistern a funnel of transparent grief that wrapped around Dante’s
  chest and cinched. He couldn’t breathe. He saw the floor of Ana’s apartment. He
  saw the little half-moon scar on her wrist from when they were kids. He saw himself
  running, always running. The siphon found that open wound and poured the room’s
  sorrow into it until he couldn’t tell where he ended and the flood began. He tried
  to call it by name, like Rosa taught, but the names slipped. He dropped to his knees.
  His coin clinked on concrete and skittered away.


  “Stop,” Lena gasped, shoving against a wind that wasn’t wind. She tried to strike
  her fork on a pipe; the pitch wavered, trapped in the killer’s field. “Dante!”


  He closed his eyes. There was a border where breath met water. He’d crossed it before
  and almost never came back. He realized, dimly, that his fear wasn’t of drowning,
  but of letting go of the last thing tying him to Ana: the guilt that said her death
  was his to carry. If he set it down, who was he? What did it say about love?


  Rosa had once taken his shaking hands in hers and said, “You can’t paint with what
  you’re hiding from. You can only paint with what you own.”


  The thought was a rasp of tinder. He put his palms flat on the wet floor, and instead
  of fighting the pull, he leaned. “I left you,” he told the vision of his sister,
  the siphon, the part of himself that had chained him to that night. “And I’m still
  here. And I love you. And I couldn’t save you.”


  The flood didn’t like being agreed with. The field faltered. In his periphery, he
  saw the coin resting near the pipe. He crawled, ribs bruising, and got his fingers
  on it. He grabbed Lena’s fallen fork with the other hand. The killer took a step,
  surprised that Dante wasn’t clawing backward.


  Dante struck the tuning fork with his coin. The note it made wasn’t pure. It was
  scarred, a little bent. It vibrated with the metal’s memory: midnight meetings,
  weak coffee, coins passed palm to palm, the simple courage of showing up again.
  The sound wasn’t loud. It threaded into the residue like a needle, stitching edges.
  It named regret and acceptance as a single color and tuned the room to it.


  The siphon’s hum skidded out of key. The funnel unwound. Emotions that had been
  coerced into a single choking note separated: sorrow that needed mourning, love
  that had been trapped in guilt’s shadow. The killer cursed—an ordinary word that
  sounded thin in the rebalanced air—and slashed at Len a with his tool. She ducked
  and jammed her shoulder into his ribs. He stumbled. Dante held the fork steady,
  coin trembling in his grip, letting the tone sustain.


  Rosa’s green returned, faint and then stronger, not her life but her teaching. The
  drained slate in the killer’s eyes flickered. For an instant he wasn’t a monster;
  he was a man who’d decided emptiness was safer than feeling. Dante saw that and
  said softly, “You don’t have to be hollow.”


  It wasn’t mercy. It was truth. The killer flinched at understanding. Lena kicked
  the siphon device into the cistern. It sparked, hissed, die d. The tunnel took up
  Dante’s note and carried it outward, away from the trap.


  The man spat and ran, a shadow folding into other shadows. Dante let him go. He
  could hunt again; stakes were bigger now. But the room had changed. Kole sobbed,
  beige guilt washing out into the damp like oil, diluted.


  Lena touched Dante’s shoulder. “You did it.”


  He looked at the coin in his hand, the fork in the other. He was shaking hard. He
  had not erased the night Ana died. He had not saved Rosa. But he’d stopped fighting
  the tide long enough to swim. He had tuned something, maybe just himself. The Buckingham
  exhaled, colors settling into something like a promise.'
