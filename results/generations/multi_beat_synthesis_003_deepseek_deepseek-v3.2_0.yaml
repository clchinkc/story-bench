output: 'The *Tsarina*’s ballroom glittered, a bubble of obscene wealth floating on
  the Monte Carlo harbor. Miri Delacroix moved through the champagne-scented crowd,
  a vision in silver lamé that cost more than her last safehouse. In her ear, Leo’s
  voice was a calm murmur. “Camera blind spot in ten seconds. The guard at the east
  stair is on his third espresso. He’s twitchy.”


  “Noted,” Miri whispered, the stem of her glass against her lips. She admired a hideous
  modern sculpture, her eyes tracing the route to the private upper deck. Her crew
  was a ghost network in the party: Leo in the security booth, feeding her data; Anya,
  playing a tipsy heiress, creating a diversion by “accidentally” spilling caviar
  on a minor royal; and Rafa, her locksmith, already nestled in a service closet near
  the target.


  The painting, a small but luminous Madonna by Pontormo, hung in Sorokin’s study,
  behind a pressure-sensitive floor and a laser grid Leo had already looped. The real
  trick was the humidity-controlled case. “It’s on a wireless monitor,” Leo had said.
  “Remove the painting, and an alert pings security. But if we mimic the sensor’s
  signal…”


  Now, Rafa’s voice came through. “Case is open. Swapping the sensor now.” Miri watched
  a server pass with a tray of oysters, a perfect distraction as she slipped through
  a paneled door and into a servant’s corridor. She met Rafa in the dim passage. The
  Pontormo sat on a velvet pad, glowing. Rafa held a tiny duplicate sensor. “Five
  seconds of signal loss is acceptable. Any more and the system defaults to alarm.”


  “Then be quick,” Miri said, but she was smiling. This was the dance she loved. Rafa
  worked, sweat beading on his temple. A cheer erupted from outside—the roar of F1
  cars blurring past on the street circuit—masking the soft click of the new sensor
  engaging. “Done,” Rafa breathed. “We’re green.”


  But as Miri reached for the painting, Leo’s voice tightened. “New complication.
  Sorokin just brought in a consultant. She’s reviewing the perimeter feeds. She’s…
  good. Alarmingly good.” A flicker of ice traced Miri’s spine. “Description?”


  “Mid-sixties, severe bun, looks like she drinks vinegar. Name’s Dubois.”


  The name was a physical blow. Claudette Dubois. Her former mentor. The woman who’d
  crafted the evidence that ended Miri’s legitimate career. The ice in Miri’s spine
  turned to fire. “Change of plan,” she said, her voice dangerously flat. “We take
  the painting now. Accelerate the exit.”


  “Miri, the timed distraction with the fireworks isn’t for twenty minutes,” Rafa
  hissed.


  “We don’t have twenty minutes.” She cradled the Madonna, its serene gaze a mockery
  of her churning gut. Claudette was here. This wasn’t a job anymore. It was a trap,
  and she’d walked right in.


  The painting was secure in a custom false-bottomed catering trolley, wheeled by
  a stone-faced Anya. The first part of the plan was a success. They had the prize.
  But as Miri re-entered the ballroom, forcing a smile, she saw her. Across the sea
  of tuxedos and diamonds, Claudette Dubois stood beside Viktor Sorokin, pointing
  with a laser pen at a security schematic on a tablet. Her eyes, sharp as flint,
  swept the room and paused. They locked onto Miri’s.


  Recognition was instant and mutual. Claudette didn’t smile. She leaned and whispered
  to Sorokin, whose jovial face hardened into something predatory. He nodded, and
  two discreet guards began moving through the crowd, not towards the exits, but inward,
  cutting off the crew’s primary retreat. Claudette’s message was clear: I know your
  play. And now the house wins. The heist was no longer about stealthy extraction.
  It was a hunt. The false victory of securing the painting evaporated, replaced by
  the cold, high-stakes reality that the architect of her ruin was now calling the
  shots for the opposition.


  “They’re sealing the deck,” Leo’s voice was strained. “All secondary exits are getting
  guards. They’re not searching yet, but they will. They’re funneling everyone toward
  the main stairs for a ‘safety check.’” Gallows humor edged his words. “I’m told
  the champagne will be complimentary during the detainment.”


  “Where’s Rafa?” Miri asked, keeping her back to a pillar.


  “Service corridor C. It’s clear for now, but it dead-ends at the crew galley. It’s
  a pocket.”


  The walls were closing in, literally. The clever, spacious yacht now felt like a
  gilded cage. Anya’s voice cut in, tight with fear. “They’ve got Rafa. Two guards
  just dragged him into a side room off the main hall. I think they made him as staff
  from the wrong department.”


  Miri’s mind split. The painting, inches away in the trolley, represented justice
  for a family waiting decades. Rafa, her friend, who trusted her enough to follow
  into this madness, was caught because she’d rushed the plan upon seeing Claudette.
  Revenge versus the mission. Her crew versus her personal ghost.


  Then Leo, trying to sound helpful, offered a brittle hope. “The ventilation shaft
  in that dead-end galley. It’s narrow, but it connects to the engine room access.
  I flagged it earlier as a possible last-resort route. It’s a five-minute crawl.
  A terrible, terrible idea.”


  It was the only idea. The Chekhov’s gun, noted with academic interest during planning,
  now had to fire. “Anya, take the trolley. Stick to the original fallback—the waste
  disposal chute to the support boat. It’s still clear. Go.” She didn’t wait for an
  argument. “Leo, guide her. I’m going for Rafa.”


  “Miri, the painting—”


  “Is your responsibility now,” she said, already moving against the flow of the glittering
  crowd, towards the shouting and the certain, vinegar-eyed gaze of her past. The
  mission had just become a rescue.'
