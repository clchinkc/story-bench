output: 'The judge cleared his throat. “Mr. Wright? Your witness.”


  Thomas rose, palms dry despite the cold in the courtroom. “Dr. Okonkwo,” he began,
  keeping his voice even, “please state your name and your position at Meridian Pharmaceuticals.”


  She did, each syllable precise, clinical. He laid a binder on the rail. “I’m showing
  you People’s Exhibits 42 through 49. Do you recognize these documents?”


  Her eyes flicked down, then away. “They look like internal reports,” she said. “But
  I can’t be certain.”


  A low hum moved through the gallery. At the defense table, the CEO’s smile settled
  in, practiced and patient. Thomas felt the note in his pocket like a heat source.
  He glanced at the gallery, at his father’s granite profile, unreadable.


  “Your Honor,” Thomas said, “may I treat the witness as hostile?”


  The defense popped up. “Improper. She’s his own witness.”


  “Basis?” the judge asked.


  “Evasion,” Thomas said, throat tight. “And bias.”


  After a beat: “Granted. Proceed.”


  Thomas stepped closer. “Dr. Okonkwo, you were head of research. Did Meridian conduct
  the Phase III trial for GL-17?”


  “Yes.”


  “Were adverse events reported to you and your team?”


  “Yes.”


  “And were those reports accurately reflected in the regulatory submissions?”


  Her jaw tightened. The silence stretched so long Thomas could hear a juror cough.
  “I…believe they were,” she said finally.


  It was a recant, wrapped in caution. The CEO’s smile widened. Thomas felt the floor
  tilt. He had built six days of case to this fulcrum, and now it was sliding.


  He made his choice.


  “Doctor,” he said, voice lowering, “has anyone offered you anything of value to
  influence your testimony today?”


  Defense counsel was up like a shot. “Objection. Relevance.”


  “Goes to bias,” Thomas said, not looking away from her. “Goes to truth.”


  The judge considered, then nodded. “Overruled. You may answer.”


  Dr. Okonkwo’s hands knotted. Thomas could see the war playing out behind her eyes,
  could almost hear the name of a hospital choking in her throat. He put both hands
  on the lectern to keep them from shaking. “I won’t pretend I don’t know why,” he
  said, every word deliberate. “Your daughter is ill. If speaking plainly here jeopardizes
  any promise made in the shadows, I will spend tonight and every night after this
  calling hospitals until I find her a trial. On the record.”


  Her head snapped up. The CEO’s smile froze, fragile now.


  “Dr. Okonkwo,” Thomas said softly, “did Meridian bury adverse event reports?”


  She inhaled like someone coming up from deep water. “Yes.”


  “Who directed it?”


  “Senior leadership. The CEO approved the plan. We changed endpoints, suppressed
  deaths as unrelated. These—” her finger tapped Exhibit 46 “—are my emails. I asked
  to stop. I was told to fall in line.”


  Murmer. The judge rapped once for order. Thomas felt the room pivot, the withheld
  truth finally entering air.


  “And the falsified trial data?”


  “We fabricated responder rates. I can authenticate every document you’ve put before
  me.”


  Thomas let the weight of it settle before asking the last question. “Is anyone coercing
  your testimony now?”


  She looked at him, eyes wet but clear. “Not anymore.”


  He nodded, only once, the way he’d seen his father nod when a difficult thing had
  finally been said aloud. Then he turned back to the jury and, for the first time
  all week, allowed himself to breathe.'
