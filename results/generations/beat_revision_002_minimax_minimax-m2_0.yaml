output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  "I don''t know." Marcus slumped into his chair. "We could try to find another location,
  but the rent anywhere else would be triple what we pay here."


  "What about the fundraiser? We still have three weeks. If we could raise enough—"


  "Maybe." He rubbed his temples. "And there''s that grant application we submitted.
  We should hear back next week. If that comes through..."


  His phone buzzed. A text from his wife: "Don''t worry, honey. We''ll figure this
  out together. Pizza tonight?"


  Marcus took a deep breath. It was bad, really bad. But he''d faced tough times before.
  His team was still with him. His family believed in him. And there were still a
  few cards left to play.


  "Okay," he said, straightening up. "Let''s call an emergency board meeting. We''re
  not giving up yet."


  Denise shifted uncomfortably. "Marcus, about that grant application..." She wouldn''t
  meet his eyes. "I... I forgot to submit the final paperwork. The deadline was yesterday.
  And the board members I called today—all three of them resigned this morning."


  Marcus stared at her, the phone slipping from his hand. His wife: gone three months
  now, buried in the ground, her texts nothing but memories of grief he''s been too
  ashamed to delete. His team: dissolving around him. His last chance at saving this
  place: ashes.


  Alone with nothing but loss and silence.'
