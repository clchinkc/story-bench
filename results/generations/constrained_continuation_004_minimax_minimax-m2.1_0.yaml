output: 'That night, Eleanor sat in her father''s study, the manuscript spread across
  his mahogany desk. The fire had burned low, casting long shadows across the pages.
  Her father''s handwriting was meticulous, documenting not the murders themselves,
  but something far more dangerous: his conclusions about who was committing them,
  and why Scotland Yard had failed to catch the killer.


  The manuscript suggested the Ripper was not some nameless phantom of the slums,
  but someone protected by influential hands. Someone whose exposure would shake the
  foundations of London society itself.


  She understood now why her father had used a pseudonym. And why he had been so secretive
  in his final months.


  A knock came at the door. Thomas entered without waiting for a response, two cups
  of tea in hand. His face was drawn.


  "I''ve spoken with the printers," he said quietly. "They''ll follow your lead, but
  they know what''s in those pages. They''re frightened."


  "Frightened of a book?"


  "Frightened of what happens when certain people learn they''ve been named." Thomas
  set her cup down and met her eyes. "Miss Blackwood, I must speak plainly. If we
  publish this, we may solve the company''s debts. But we may also find ourselves
  ruined—or worse. There are powerful forces in this city that do not appreciate scrutiny."


  Eleanor closed the manuscript. "And if we don''t publish? What then?"


  "The creditors take the printing house within three months. It becomes someone else''s
  property. Your father''s life''s work disappears." He paused. "And I lose the only
  place that has ever treated me with dignity."


  She looked at him sharply. Thomas had never spoken so personally before.


  "My parents came to this country with nothing," he continued. "They built a life
  in the face of contempt and limitation. This printing house gave me opportunity
  when London told me I deserved none. If it falls, I have nowhere else to go. My
  family''s future is tied to yours, whether you knew it or not."


  The weight of his confession settled between them. Eleanor had thought she was deciding
  alone. But she was deciding for both of them, and for everyone who depended on Blackwood
  & Sons.


  She thought of her father, who had trained her in secret to read balance sheets
  and negotiate with suppliers, even as society insisted a woman''s place was ignorance.
  She thought of William, who had abandoned this inheritance without a second thought.
  She thought of every occasion she had been told to remain silent, to defer, to disappear.


  The manuscript stared up at her from the desk. Her father''s final gift, and his
  final challenge.


  "Set the presses for tomorrow," she said. "We publish in one week''s time."


  Thomas exhaled slowly. "You''re certain?"


  "Certain that we''re risking everything? Yes." Eleanor stood, moving to the window.
  Fog rolled through the streets below, obscuring the gas lamps. Somewhere in that
  mist, women walked paths that might lead to their deaths while powerful men slept
  soundly in their beds. "I''m certain that silence has protected criminals long enough.
  And I''m certain that if I''m to inherit my father''s legacy, I must be worthy of
  it."


  The next morning, Eleanor Blackwood walked into the printing house floor for the
  first time as its master. The workers looked up from their stations, uncertain what
  to expect from a woman who should have been at home in mourning.


  "I won''t pretend to know everything about this business," she told them. "But I
  know this: we have work that matters. Those who can''t abide by that are free to
  leave. Those who stay will share in whatever comes."


  No one left.


  By midnight, the first copies emerged from the presses, their pages carrying secrets
  that powerful men wanted buried. Eleanor had crossed a threshold from which there
  was no return. The die was cast, the challenge issued, and whatever consequences
  followed would find Blackwood & Sons ready to face them.


  A shadow had fallen across the printing house. And Eleanor, with Thomas at her side,
  had chosen to walk forward into the dark.'
