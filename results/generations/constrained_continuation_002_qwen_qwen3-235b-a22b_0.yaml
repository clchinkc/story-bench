output: "The blogger’s post exploded. By noon, a crowd five-deep lined the curb, phones\
  \ raised high to capture the spectacle: electric pink truck, neon signage crookedly\
  \ spelling “Taco Bahn,” and a menu board that dared to fuse paneer with brisket.\
  \ Priya and Dev flew through orders, sweat and flour smudging their aprons.  \n\n\
  “Three paneer quesadillas, one vegan!” Dev shouted, flipping tortillas like pancakes.\
  \  \n\n“They’re *all* vegan unless you add the butter chicken!” Priya corrected,\
  \ laughing as she shoveled mango chutney into a fifth container for a TikTok influencer.\
  \ The line erupted in applause when she tossed in free samosas.  \n\nBy sunset,\
  \ they’d sold out of everything but rice. Dev high-fived Priya, his usual skepticism\
  \ drowned out by adrenaline. “Okay, genius. We’re trending. Now what?”  \n\n“Now\
  \ we *stay* trending.” Priya pulled up a map, zooming in on the cluster of food\
  \ trucks near Auditorium Shores. Her finger landed on a pin labeled *Smoky Ridge\
  \ BBQ*, a local staple. “Tomorrow, we park next to them.”  \n\nDev groaned. “The\
  \ food truck wars are real, Priya.”  \n\n---  \n\nSmoky Ridge’s truck gleamed chrome\
  \ under the noon sun, its line snaking into the street. Priya parked diagonally\
  \ across from it, blocking half the road. Dev winced as the owner, a barrel-chested\
  \ man with a handlebar mustache, stepped out to glare.  \n\n“Y’all lost?” he drawled.\
  \  \n\n“Just here to share some *culture*,” Priya called, hoisting a sign: *FREE\
  \ CHILI-INFUSED GULAB JAMUN WITH PURCHASE!*  \n\nThe stunt worked. Smoky Ridge’s\
  \ customers defected, lured by novelty. Dev, realizing their chili-laced dessert\
  \ tacos were a viral goldmine, rigged a second grill to meet demand. He and Priya\
  \ fell into rhythm—she charred corn on the cob, he slathered it in tamarind glaze,\
  \ hands moving in sync.  \n\nBy 3 p.m., their till overflowed with cash. Priya punched\
  \ the air, then froze.  \n\nSmoky Ridge had vanished.  \n\n“Rerouted his GPS,” Dev\
  \ muttered, phone in hand. “He’s… opening a *second* truck downtown.”  \n\n“Classic\
  \ pivot,” Priya said, but unease prickled her. They’d won today, but Smoky Ridge’s\
  \ retaliation would be faster, meaner.  \n\n---  \n\nThat night, they tallied receipts\
  \ in the truck’s skeletal dining area. Priya tapped her phone screen. “We’re number\
  \ one on Yelp. *Again*.”  \n\nDev, wiping grease from his wrists, hesitated. “The\
  \ health inspector’s getting slammed online. Some guy from the morning rush wrote\
  \ we ‘served him salmonella with a side of cultural confusion.’”  \n\n“He had *one*\
  \ questionable taco two weeks ago!”  \n\n“Still—it’s trending. If they audit us…”\
  \  \n\n“We’re clean. Mostly.” Priya’s voice dipped. They’d bent a few permit rules\
  \ to speed up prep.  \n\nDev leaned forward, elbows on the sticky table. “Smoky\
  \ Ridge’s next move’s gonna be ugly. They’ve got city council ties. We need to—”\
  \  \n\nPriya cut him off with a grin. “We need to *celebrate*. We’re winning.” \
  \ \n\nHe stared at her, then snorted. “You’re unhinged.”  \n\n“But you’re still\
  \ here.”  \n\n“Yeah,” he said quietly. “I’m here.”  \n\nThe radio crackled in the\
  \ silent kitchen. *“…health department launching surprise inspections this week.\
  \ Stay tuned…”*  \n\nPriya killed the volume. She and Dev exchanged a glance—sharp,\
  \ electric, wordless. They’d built this chaos together.  \n\nOutside, Smoky Ridge’s\
  \ second truck idled into the parking lot.  \n\nInside, Priya’s phone buzzed. The\
  \ blogger was coming tomorrow. To *try* the chili tacos.  \n\nThey were on top of\
  \ the world.  \n\nThey were already falling."
