  Amara''s fingers trembled as she folded the intercepted dispatch into her palm—British
  orders, written carelessly in the commandant''s own hand, listing twenty names for
  arrest. Her father''s name was fourth. She had read it twice to be certain, her
  contraband literacy suddenly a curse instead of a gift.


  The servant''s entrance to the colonial house had become her exit. She left at dusk,
  when the servants changed shifts, wearing her plainest wrapper and carrying nothing
  but water and the letter sewn into her hem. The guards at the compound gate barely
  glanced at her. A woman. A nobody. Invisible in the way that had always infuriated
  her and now, for the first time, saved her.


  The forest began beyond the market district, dark and alive with sounds she had
  never heard from Cape Coast''s ordered streets. Amara forced herself to walk steadily,
  to breathe. The dirt road split twice, and at the second fork, she encountered a
  British patrol returning to the capital. Four soldiers on horseback, bored and tired.


  She did not run. Running would mark her as something other than what she appeared.


  Instead, she crouched beside the road, pretending to gather firewood, keeping her
  face down as they passed. One soldier slowed his horse. "You there—what''s your
  business?"


  Amara''s mind raced. She switched to the pidgin English of the market women, thickening
  her accent, making her voice smaller. "Firewood, sah. For my mother''s cooking.
  She sick." She held up an armful of scattered branches, never lifting her eyes.


  "Move on," he said, and they continued.


  When their hoofbeats faded into the forest sounds, Amara stood, her entire body
  shaking. She had crossed a line she could not uncross. She was no longer a servant
  who overheard things. She was a fugitive carrying proof of conspiracy. Every moment
  she remained outside the capital walls, she ceased to be a possible suspect and
  became an actual threat.


  She walked through the night.


  By dawn, Amara reached a village where a woman selling cassava bread recognized
  the resistance signal her father had taught her years ago—three fingers pressed
  to her chest. The woman, Ama Sey, was perhaps fifty, with one eye scarred closed
  and a bearing that suggested she had seen worse than what came now.


  "You have it?" Ama Sey asked quietly, no names spoken.


  Amara nodded and produced the letter.


  Ama Sey read it, her function eye narrowing. "Your father?"


  "Yes."


  "Then we move fast." But Ama Sey did not move. She studied Amara''s face. "They''ll
  send riders ahead. The forest roads will be watched within hours. We must take the
  old path through the sacred groves—but only members know it. I need to know you''re
  committed. This path..." She gestured vaguely westward. "It goes through places
  that test people. It demands respect and sacrifice."


  "My father''s life demands it," Amara said.


  "Your father''s life is one thing. What you will become..." Ama Sey handed back
  the letter. "That is another. Are you ready to become dangerous?"


  That word struck differently than Amara expected. Not dangerous like the soldiers.
  Dangerous like knowledge itself.


  "Yes," she said.


  They traveled for two days before Amara understood what Ama Sey meant. At a river
  crossing, British scouts appeared on the opposite bank—deliberately placed, searching.
  Ama Sey grabbed Amara''s arm. "The old path ends here. They''re waiting." Her scarred
  eye fixed on the letter in Amara''s hands. "Can you read German?"


  Amara''s breath caught. "Yes."


  "Those soldiers report to a German merchant who trades information. He trusts documents
  more than people." Ama Sey tore a page from her market ledger, wet from river crossing.
  "Write him a receipt. German. For goods we supposedly sold him. Make it authentic."


  Amara''s hands flew across the soggy paper, her careful German forming words of
  commercial fiction. She signed with a forged merchant''s mark she half-remembered
  from documents she''d cleaned and read.


  As they approached the soldiers, Ama Sey waved the receipt. "German merchant''s
  payment," she called out. "For the palm oil trade."


  The soldiers glanced at the document, saw the Gothic script, and—not reading it
  themselves—waved them through without a second look.


  Knowledge had become a weapon. Amara understood then that she could not return to
  Cape Coast unchanged. Every mile closer to the resistance stronghold meant she shed
  another skin of the person she had pretended to be.


  By evening, the forest grew denser, and guards emerged from the undergrowth—men
  with rifles, faces Amara did not recognize but who saluted Ama Sey with visible
  relief. Beyond them, smoke rose from cooking fires deeply hidden in the bush. The
  stronghold.


  "Your father is there," Ama Sey said. "But you understand—once you deliver that
  letter, your father will no longer be safe because his daughter is lost. The world
  will believe they executed you."


  Amara held the letter to her chest, feeling its weight. She thought of her father
  reading by candlelight while she pretended to scrub beneath his desk, her eyes drinking
  in banned words. She thought of every book hidden, every truth encoded in languages
  they were not supposed to know.


  "The world can believe what it wishes," Amara said. "The truth is what we make it
  now."


  She walked toward the fires.'
