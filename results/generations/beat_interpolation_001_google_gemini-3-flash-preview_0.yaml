output: 'Elena didn’t sleep. The map’s rhythmic pulsing had leaked through the floorboards
  of her bedroom all night, a heartbeat she couldn’t ignore. By dawn, she found herself
  at the door of a cluttered curiosity shop, the bell chiming as she stepped into
  the scent of cedar and old metal.


  Marcus didn’t look up from a pile of rusted gears. The former adventurer’s hands
  were scarred, but his touch was delicate. "I wondered when the Wellspring would
  finally call for a cataloger," he rasped.


  "It’s a mistake, Marcus," Elena said, setting the map on his counter. "I’m meant
  to organize history, not make it. I handle index cards, not swords."


  Marcus finally looked at her, his eyes sharp beneath bushy brows. He didn’t laugh.
  Instead, he reached beneath the counter and pulled out a worn leather satchel and
  a brass compass. "A library is just a labyrinth of ideas, Elena. You’ve spent a
  decade navigating the most complex maps ever drawn—the human mind. Why do you think
  the Wellspring chose a librarian?"


  He pushed the compass toward her. "The Thornwood isn''t just a thicket; it’s a riddle.
  It doesn''t need a warrior to bleed for it. It needs someone who knows how to read
  the patterns hidden in the chaos. Your skills aren''t ''ordinary'' out there—they''re
  the only things that will keep you from losing your way."


  Elena touched the cold brass of the compass. She still felt spectacularly unqualified,
  a woman whose greatest thrill was a well-placed footnote. Yet, as Marcus described
  the forest not as a monster to be slain, but as a text to be deciphered, the crushing
  weight of her fear shifted. It didn''t vanish, but it settled into something manageable—a
  problem to be solved.


  "I don''t know if I can do this," she whispered, her fingers tightening around the
  satchel strap.


  "You don''t need to know the ending yet," Marcus replied. "You just need to be the
  one who turns the page."'
