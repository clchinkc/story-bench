output: 'The secret passage was a throat of jagged stone, swallowing them into the
  deeper dark. Behind them, the shouts of the Scorpion Guild echoed like distortions
  in a nightmare, growing fainter but no less urgent. The tunnel spilled them out
  onto a narrow ledge overlooking a chasm that smelled of ancient, stagnant water.
  A rusted iron bridge spanned the gap, but as Tomás stepped onto it, the metal groaned
  and lurched violently to the left.


  The scholar stumbled, his boot slipping through a rotted grate. He caught himself
  on the rail, dangling precariously over the abyss.


  Zara had already cleared the unstable section. She stood on solid rock, the path
  to the Sunken Library’s entrance clear ahead. The Scorpions were minutes away; if
  she ran now, she could vanish into the shadows of the Approach and leave Tomás to
  his fate. He was dead weight, a liability who breathed too loud and moved too slow.
  But without him, the map was just ink on parchment; she couldn''t decipher the index
  of the Library alone.


  Cursing her hesitation, she turned back. "Don''t move," she hissed.


  She scrambled onto the groaning metal, distributing her weight as she had learned
  on the slate rooftops of the capital. She gripped Tomás’s wrist, her boots finding
  purchase on the rivets, and hauled him up just as a crossbow bolt skittered against
  the stone where she had been standing. They collapsed onto the far ledge, chest
  heaving.


  "You came back," Tomás wheezed, looking at her with a mixture of shock and calculation.


  "You''re my compass," Zara said coldly, checking her knife. "Don''t read into it."


  They pressed forward until the tunnel ended at a massive circular door of basalt,
  etched with concentric rings of silver script. There was no keyhole, only a complex
  array of shifting tumblers recessed into the stone—a puzzle lock of the highest
  order.


  "The Silent Gate," Tomás whispered, wiping sweat from his brow. "One wrong click
  triggers a collapse. Can you do it?"


  Zara knelt, pressing her ear against the cold stone. She drew a slender tension
  wrench from her boot. As she worked the delicate mechanism, feeling for the vibrations
  of the tumblers, the silence stretched thin between them.


  "You fight well for a scholar," Zara murmured, her focus entirely on the third ring.


  "I’m not doing this for the pursuit of knowledge, Zara," Tomás said, his voice dropping.
  "The Guild didn''t just disgrace me. They erased my lineage. The book I’m after—the
  *Codex of Vane*—it contains the names of the founding families. It proves I own
  the land their guildhall sits on. I don''t care about the cure. I care about evicting
  them."


  Zara paused, the pick still in her hand. He wasn''t a benevolent ally; he was a
  man fueled by petty vengeance, willing to risk her life for a property dispute.
  The realization settled over her, heavy and cynical.


  "We all want something," she said, twisting the final tumbler. "Just don''t get
  in my way."


  The basalt door groaned and rolled aside, revealing not a room, but a pool of black,
  viscous liquid. The air above it was unbreathable, thick with heavy, toxic vapors
  that burned the eyes.


  "The Drowning," Tomás said, stepping back. "The only way in is under. You have to
  hold your breath until you reach the siphon on the other side. If you inhale even
  once… your lungs turn to stone."


  Zara stared at the black surface. This was the Ordeal. Her heart hammered against
  her ribs, not from the fear of the liquid, but from the paralyzing terror that had
  stalked her since she left the capital: the fear that she wasn''t enough. That she
  was just a gutter rat playing hero, and that her mother would die waiting for a
  daughter who drowned in the dark.


  She closed her eyes, visualizing her mother’s pale, wasting face. That fear had
  to die here, or she would.


  "Stay close," she commanded.


  She took the deepest breath of her life and plunged in.


  The cold was absolute. It bit through her clothes, seeking the warmth of her blood.
  She swam blindly, dragging Tomás by his collar. Her lungs began to burn, screaming
  for air, her instincts demanding she gasp. The panic rose, a frantic animal clawing
  at her throat. *I can’t make it. I’m going to fail her.*


  In the crushing silence, Zara let the panic wash over her and drift away. She stopped
  fighting the dark and became part of it. The girl who stole apples in the market
  died in that black water, drowned by the weight of the deep.


  Her hand struck stone. She clawed upward, breaking the surface into a pocket of
  clean air. She dragged herself onto the damp flagstones, hacking up bile and black
  water, shivering violently. She pulled Tomás up beside her; he was limp but breathing.


  Zara sat up, wiping the slime from her eyes. The trembling in her hands was gone.
  She felt hollowed out, harder, stripped of the doubt that had plagued her. She checked
  her gear; the map was dry in its oilskin case.


  She looked ahead. They were in the atrium of the Sunken Library. But the silence
  was wrong. It wasn''t the silence of a tomb, but the silence of an ambush.


  At the far end of the hall, the massive doors to the Archives stood wide open, and
  the dust on the floor was disturbed by footprints that did not belong to the Scorpion
  Guild.'
