output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, her voice cracking. She clutched
  her phone, the screen still lit with the email from the grant committee: *"We regret
  to inform you..."*


  Marcus didn’t look up. "The fundraiser’s already failed. Half the sponsors pulled
  out when they heard about the eviction. And the grant?" He crumpled the notice in
  his fist. "Denise, you *read* it. They called our program ‘unsustainable.’"


  Her fingers trembled as she scrolled through her messages. "I—I thought if we just
  explained—"


  "Explained what?" His voice was raw. "That we’re the only safe place for these kids?
  That half of them don’t have anywhere else to go?" He laughed, a sharp, broken sound.
  "They don’t care. No one does."


  The phone in his pocket buzzed. He ignored it. Then it buzzed again. And again.


  Denise’s breath hitched. "Marcus, your wife—"


  "Don’t." He cut her off, his throat tight. The texts kept coming, each one a knife
  twist: *"Honey, call me. It’s your dad. The hospital just—"* He silenced the phone,
  shoved it into his drawer.


  The room tilted. Fifteen years. Hundreds of kids. His father, who’d always been
  the one to bail him out, now fighting for his life in some sterile ward. And Denise—Denise,
  who’d been his right hand, his ally—stood there with tears in her eyes, her silence
  louder than any apology.


  "There’s nothing left," he said.


  The words hung between them, heavy as the notice in his hand. No board meeting could
  fix this. No last-minute miracle. Just the hollow echo of a program that had been
  his life, now collapsing into dust.'
