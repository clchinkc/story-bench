output: 'Morning light found Elena back at the kitchen table, the map still glowing
  faintly, stubborn as a bad idea. Her grandmother’s ghost was gone. The silence felt
  like a challenge.


  “This is ridiculous,” she muttered, rolling the brittle parchment with more care
  than she intended. “I’m just going to have Marcus tell me it’s a fake, and then
  I can go back to reshelving biographies.”


  The bell above Marcus’s curiosity shop jingled as she stepped inside. Shelves bowed
  under clocks that ticked out of sync, cloudy bottles, tarnished weapons. It smelled
  like dust and metal and old paper—comforting, despite everything.


  Marcus looked up from a ledger, grey at the temples now but with the relaxed posture
  of someone who still expected trouble to walk through the door. “You look like you
  didn’t sleep,” he said. “Or like something interesting finally happened to you.”


  She unrolled the map on his counter. His joke died. For a long moment he only stared,
  thumb tracing the air above the runes.


  “I thought this was gone,” he murmured. “Thornwood. The Wellspring.” His eyes flicked
  to her. “Who gave you this?”


  “It… appeared. To me. By mistake, obviously.” She tried to sound flippant; it came
  out thin. “Tell me it’s nonsense so I can stop thinking about it.”


  Marcus huffed a soft laugh. “Elena, you spend your life navigating labyrinths of
  information. You see patterns, cross‑references, gaps. Do you know how many idiots
  I watched die because they swung swords instead of reading the warnings?” He tapped
  the map. “This chose a librarian on purpose.”


  Her throat tightened. “I don’t know how to fight.”


  “The forest tests intentions, not abilities,” Marcus said quietly. “Remember that.
  Trust what you know, not what you fear you lack.”


  He moved away, rummaging under the counter, and returned with a worn leather satchel
  and a brass compass whose needle spun restlessly.


  “Supplies,” he said, pressing the satchel into her hands. “The compass doesn’t point
  north. It points to where you’re meant to be heading, more or less. Unreliable,
  cantankerous thing. You’ll get along.”


  She clutched the strap, the weight of it startling. This was absurd. Dangerous.
  Not her.


  But the map’s runes pulsed in quiet agreement with something low in her chest she
  didn’t have a name for.


  “You’re not coming with me,” she realized.


  Marcus shook his head. “My days of running from carnivorous shrubbery are over.
  Besides, if I go, it’s my story again. This one isn’t.”


  She almost said no again. Instead she heard herself ask, “If I… if I wrote everything
  down as I went—would that help?”


  His smile creased deep lines into his face. “That’s exactly why it has to be you.
  Go there like a librarian. Observe. Catalogue. Ask better questions than anyone
  before you.”


  Elena looked from Marcus, to the map, to the waiting door. Fear hadn’t lessened,
  but it had… shifted. It wasn’t a wall now. More like a very narrow, badly lit hallway
  she might, possibly, walk through.


  “I’ll bring the map back,” she said, rolling it carefully, sliding it into the satchel.


  “I’ll be here,” Marcus replied. “Try not to misfile yourself permanently.”


  As she stepped into the pale morning, the bell chimed behind her. The world looked
  almost the same, but the satchel pulled at her shoulder, and the compass in her
  pocket ticked softly, as if impatient for her to decide which version of herself
  would leave the village.'
