  The neon glow of the Buckingham’s broken sign flickered like a dying heartbeat as
  Dante Reyes stepped over the threshold, the air thick with the weight of a thousand
  unspoken sorrows. The abandoned hotel’s lobby was a graveyard of velvet and gilt,
  its walls pulsing with the residue of decades—joy, despair, and everything in between.
  Dante’s fingers twitched, his gift flaring to life. Colors bled from the peeling
  wallpaper: crimson streaks of rage, sickly yellow pools of fear, and the deep, bruised
  purple of old grief. He exhaled, steadying himself. Three years clean, but the hunger
  for oblivion still gnawed at him, a ghost in the corners of his mind.


  A shadow moved. Dante’s hand shot to the knife in his boot before he registered
  the figure leaning against the grand staircase—a woman with sharp cheekbones and
  a glare that could strip paint. Her dark hair was cropped short, and her fingers
  drummed against the banister, leaving behind faint, shimmering imprints of irritation.
  A Resonant, then. And not a friendly one.


  “You’re him,” she said, voice like gravel. “Dante Reyes. The addict who sees too
  much.”


  Dante’s jaw tightened. “And you’re the one who’s been following me for three blocks.”


  She pushed off the staircase, stepping into the dim light. “Name’s Lila Voss. And
  I don’t trust you.”


  “Noted.” Dante gestured to the lobby. “You gonna tell me why you’re here, or do
  I have to guess?”


  Lila’s eyes flicked to the knife in his hand. “Put that away. You’re not the only
  one who’s armed.” She reached into her jacket and pulled out a small, silver device—no
  bigger than a cigarette lighter, but humming with a low, resonant frequency. “This
  is a dampener. Blocks emotional resonance for about thirty seconds. Useful when
  you don’t want to be seen.”


  Dante’s pulse kicked up. “Where’d you get that?”


  “Stole it.” Lila’s lips quirked. “From the same people who’ve been hunting Resonants.
  The ones who killed Rosa.”


  The name hit him like a punch to the gut. Rosa had been more than a mentor; she’d
  been the one who’d dragged him out of the gutter after his sister’s overdose, who’d
  taught him to see his gift as something more than a curse. And now she was gone,
  her emotional signature—warm amber, like sunlight through whiskey—snuffed out.


  Dante’s vision blurred for a second, the colors in the room bleeding together. He
  forced himself to focus. “You think I don’t know that?”


  Lila’s expression didn’t soften, but her voice dropped. “I think you’re a liability.
  Addicts don’t exactly have a reputation for reliability.”


  The old shame coiled in his chest, but Dante met her gaze. “I’m clean. And I’m not
  leaving until I find who did this.”


  Lila studied him for a long moment, then tossed the dampener to him. “Prove it.
  There’s a trap set up in the old ballroom. Someone’s been luring Resonants there,
  draining them dry. You go in, you get us the info we need to find the killer. And
  you don’t get caught.”


  Dante caught the device, its weight familiar in his palm. “What’s the catch?”


  “You’ll see.” Lila jerked her chin toward the hallway. “Ballroom’s that way. And
  Reyes? If you screw this up, I walk. No second chances.”

  The ballroom was a cavern of shattered chandeliers and rotting opulence, the air
  thick with the metallic tang of fear. Dante moved silently, his boots barely disturbing
  the dust. The dampener hummed in his pocket, but he didn’t activate it yet. He needed
  to see.


  And then he did.


  The emotional residue here was a storm—violent reds, churning blacks, the sickly
  green of despair. It cloyed at his throat, threatening to drag him under. He gritted
  his teeth, forcing himself to breathe. *Three years clean. Three years sober.* He
  could handle this.


  A figure moved in the shadows. Dante pressed himself against a pillar, watching
  as a man—tall, gaunt, his suit too expensive for this place—dragged a struggling
  woman toward the center of the room. The woman’s emotional signature was a flickering
  blue, weak but defiant. A Resonant. Another victim.


  Dante’s fingers closed around the dampener. He had seconds to decide.


  He activated it.


  The world went silent. The colors vanished, leaving only the stark reality of the
  ballroom—the peeling wallpaper, the broken glass, the man’s cold, calculating eyes
  as he turned toward Dante.


  “Ah,” the man said, smiling. “There you are.”


  Dante’s blood turned to ice. He knew that voice.


  The man stepped into the light, and Dante’s breath left him in a rush. It was *him*—the
  man from the alley three years ago, the one who’d sold his sister the bad batch.
  The one who’d laughed as Dante begged for help.


  “Miss me, Reyes?” the man asked, tilting his head. “I’ve been waiting for you.”


  Dante’s hands shook. The dampener’s effect was fading; the colors were creeping
  back in, but slower now, like syrup. He had to move.


  He lunged.


  ---


  The plan had been simple: get in, get the info, get out. But plans never survived
  the first punch.


  Dante’s fist connected with the killer’s jaw, sending him stumbling back. The woman—Lila’s
  contact—scrabbled away, her blue signature flaring with panic. Dante didn’t have
  time to check on her. The killer was already recovering, his lips curling into a
  smirk.


  “You hit like a man who’s still running,” the killer taunted, wiping blood from
  his mouth. “But you can’t outrun the past, Reyes. Not when it’s *inside* you.”


  Dante’s vision swam. The colors were back in full force now, a maelstrom of emotion—his
  own guilt, the killer’s glee, the victim’s terror. It was too much. His knees buckled.


  *Three years clean. Three years sober.*


  He repeated it like a mantra, but the words felt hollow. The killer was right. He
  *was* running. From the guilt, from the memory of his sister’s lifeless body, from
  the fact that he’d failed her. And now Rosa was gone too, and it was his fault because
  he hadn’t been fast enough, strong enough—


  The dampener slipped from his fingers, clattering to the floor. The killer laughed,
  stepping closer.


  “That’s it,” he murmured. “Let it in. Let it *drown* you.”


  Dante’s hands clenched into fists. He could feel the old cravings clawing at him,
  the desperate need to numb the pain, to make it stop. But he wasn’t that man anymore.


  He *wouldn’t* be.


  With a snarl, Dante grabbed the dampener and *slammed* it against the killer’s temple.
  The man staggered, his emotional signature flickering—black, oily, *wrong*. Dante
  didn’t hesitate. He drove his knee into the killer’s gut, then twisted, flipping
  him onto his back.


  “You don’t get to win,” Dante growled, pressing the dampener to the killer’s chest.
  “Not this time.”


  The killer’s laughter turned to a choked gasp as the device’s frequency resonated
  through him, unraveling the stolen emotions he’d hoarded. His body convulsed, his
  signature unspooling like thread—black dissolving into nothing.


  And then it was over.


  Dante collapsed beside the body, his breath ragged. The ballroom was silent, the
  colors fading back into the walls, into the past. He was alive. He’d won.


  But the guilt was still there.


  He closed his eyes, letting the truth settle over him like a shroud. He’d never
  outrun it. But maybe—just maybe—he could learn to carry it.


  Lila’s voice cut through the silence. “Reyes.”


  He looked up. She stood in the doorway, her expression unreadable. Behind her, the
  woman they’d saved was already on her feet, her blue signature steadying.


  “You did it,” Lila said.


  Dante pushed himself up, wiping blood from his split lip. “Yeah. I did.”


  She held out a hand. “Then let’s go. We’ve got a lot of work to do.”


  Dante took it, pulling himself up. The dampener was still warm in his pocket—a reminder
  of what he’d almost lost, and what he’d found instead.


  The past was never gone. But neither was he.'
