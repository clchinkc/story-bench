output: 'Jin stepped out of the elevator into a vast, humming atrium that felt more
  like a floating bazaar than a space station. The air was crisp, laced with the metallic
  tang of recycled oxygen, and gravity here was a gentle approximation—enough to keep
  feet on the floor but light enough to make every step a cautious bounce. People
  moved in clusters, dressed in patchwork jumpsuits adorned with holographic badges
  that flickered like digital flags. Languages blended in a cacophony: Mandarin, English,
  Swahili, code-switched into something new. The Collective wasn''t a unified nation;
  it was a patchwork of ideologies, from anarcho-syndicalists to corporate defectors,
  all bound by that single rule against extradition. But navigating it meant deciphering
  unwritten codes—who controlled the hydroponic farms, who hoarded the solar arrays,
  who whispered about alliances back on Earth.


  He clutched his data slate, the one holding the leaked files, and tried to blend
  in. A processing drone scanned him, its voice flat: "Refugee status granted. No
  terrestrial warrants apply. Report to Sector 7 for orientation." Sector 7 turned
  out to be a dimly lit hub of modular pods, where newcomers like him milled about,
  trading stories of escape. Jin''s stomach knotted; he wasn''t used to this chaos.
  On Earth, his life had been labs and lectures, predictable rhythms shattered by
  his whistleblowing. Here, a group of orbital natives eyed him suspiciously, muttering
  about "dirt-siders" who brought trouble. When he asked for directions to a comms
  terminal, they laughed—comms were rationed, prioritized for Collective broadcasts,
  not personal vendettas.


  It was in that haze of disorientation that he met Elias. The older man, wiry with
  a beard streaked gray like comet tails, approached him in a communal mess hall.
  Elias wore a badge proclaiming "Free Info League," and his eyes held the weary spark
  of someone who''d fought too many battles. "You look lost, kid," he said, sliding
  a nutrient bar across the table. "First time off-planet?" Jin nodded, wary but desperate.
  Elias had been a Council engineer once, exiled for similar reasons—sabotaging a
  surveillance satellite. Over the next few hours, as they wandered the station''s
  twisting corridors, Elias became his guide. He explained the politics: the Collective
  was divided into factions. The Pragmatists traded tech with Earth for resources,
  while the Radicals pushed for total severance, seeing any tie as a vulnerability.
  "Safety here isn''t free," Elias warned. "You want a platform? Earn it by contributing.
  But watch your back—the Pragmatists have spies everywhere, feeding intel back down."


  Jin absorbed it all, struggling against the isolation. Meals were communal but portioned
  by vote; sleeping pods assigned by lottery. He fumbled through a faction meeting,
  his Earth accent drawing smirks, his ideas on sustainability dismissed as "grounded
  thinking." Elias helped him navigate, introducing him to a Radical subgroup that
  valued his leaked data. "Your carbon tech could power our independence," Elias said.
  "No more begging for shipments." But as Jin shared fragments of his research, he
  uncovered something unexpected. Digging into Collective archives with Elias''s access,
  he found encrypted logs from a defector: the suppressed technology wasn''t just
  about carbon capture. It had a dual purpose—a hidden application for atmospheric
  manipulation, capable of weaponizing weather patterns. The Council hadn''t buried
  it solely for profit; they feared it could be reverse-engineered into a tool for
  orbital rebellion, tilting global power toward the stars. The revelation hit Jin
  like decompression sickness. His leak had exposed more than greed; it had unearthed
  a potential weapon, one the Collective might covet for their own ends.


  In the Radicals'' hidden lab, amidst humming servers and zero-g experiments, Jin
  found what he thought he wanted. They offered him safety—a secure pod, encrypted
  channels to broadcast his message galaxy-wide, amplifying his fight against the
  Council. "Join us," their leader urged. "We''ll make your voice heard." It felt
  like vindication, a platform to rally others, to continue the work Yuna had risked
  everything for. But Elias pulled him aside, his voice low. "They''ll want the full
  schematics. Not just for capture—for the weapon side. You give that, and you''re
  complicit in whatever they build."


  The choice gnawed at him through sleepless cycles, the station''s hum a constant
  reminder of his exile. Safety and a voice, but at what cost? Broadcasting the truth
  meant handing over the dual-use tech, potentially arming the Radicals against Earth
  in ways that could escalate to catastrophe. Refuse, and he''d be cast out, vulnerable
  to Pragmatist extradition whispers. In the end, the moral compromise settled like
  orbital dust: he couldn''t let the Council win unchallenged. During a late-night
  transfer in the lab, Jin uploaded the files—altered subtly to disable the weapon
  function, but complete enough to buy his place. The Radicals cheered, granting him
  access to their network. He broadcast his first message that night, decrying the
  Council''s lies, his words beaming toward Earth and beyond.


  But the price came swiftly. Elias, discovering the upload, confronted him in the
  corridor. "You think they won''t figure out the sabotage? You''ve made enemies here
  now." Jin''s heart sank; his mentor''s trust fractured, and whispers spread—doubts
  about his loyalty. He''d gained his platform, but at the expense of isolation in
  this new world, the weight of compromise pressing heavier than Earth''s gravity
  ever had.'
