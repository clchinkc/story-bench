output: 'Maya’s days drifted like tide across her small coastal village. In a sunlit
  room above the harbor, she taught children how to center clay, how to make humble
  bowls that warmed rice and held soup. Her shelves were practical, honest. She avoided
  the ceremonial forms her grandmother had shaped—tall, ghost-still vessels that once
  held more than water. The sacred spring fed the village. Maya’s work fed each table.


  When the spring thinned to a whisper and then to dust, the elders knocked on her
  door. The air tasted of salt and worry. “A master’s vessel is needed,” they said,
  eyes slipping toward the portraits of her grandmother that hung in the hall. That
  night Maya dreamed of a kiln’s breath, of clay turning under hands not her own,
  of water rising like a voice.


  At morning she told herself the dream was only longing. “I make what’s used,” she
  said to the empty studio. “I am not her.” She offered names of other potters in
  distant towns, imagined a caravan of more capable hands. But the wind carried the
  silence of the dry spring through her window, and her students’ cups sat waiting,
  wanting to be useful and filled.


  Two nights later, a knock came soft as a wave. Old Sura, who had known Maya’s grandmother,
  brought a wrapped bundle: a walking stick smoothed by decades of palms, a small
  pouch of ash glaze, and a story. “Your grandmother walked to the mountain shrine
  when she felt lost,” Sura murmured. “She said the mountain taught her to listen.”
  In the candle’s wavering light, Maya remembered her grandmother’s hands, the way
  they hovered before pressing, as if waiting for permission.


  Before dawn she left, the stick tapping stone, the village shrinking behind her.
  The path climbed out of sea smell and into pine. History pressed on her back like
  the pack she carried. With each switchback the world below quieted until all that
  remained was the scrape of her soles and a hush that felt like a held breath.


  Rain tested her first day, fine as mist and then blowing cold. On the second, a
  shepherd shared tea and bread, speaking of the mountain’s moods. “She prefers the
  patient,” he said, as if the slopes were a person with old hurts. A white heron
  kept reappearing ahead, lifting, settling, lifting again. Yet doubts walked beside
  her as equal company. When the path narrowed along a ravine, she met fear the way
  hands meet wet clay—tentative, then firm. Once, her travel cup cracked at the rim;
  she patched it with slip and patience and it held.


  The shrine crouched at the summit like a rib cage, bones of charred beams and broken
  tiles. Weeds threaded the courtyard. The kiln, bricked and black, was cold as a
  mouth without breath. She swept debris, stacked old wood, and found under a loose
  stone a thin journal wrapped in cloth gone to dust. Her grandmother’s hand leaned
  across the pages: notes, gestures, small drawings of movement. One line was underlined
  twice: Let the clay speak. Your hands are not the sculptor.


  Night fell without consult. She built the fire until the kiln exhaled its faint
  animal warmth. On the wheel, she placed a lump of clay and tried to recall the exacting
  coils and exact rituals the elders demanded. Her fingers argued, insisting on control.
  The form collapsed. Again she began. Again her hands tightened. She remembered the
  underlined words and, with breath, loosened. The wheel slowed. She stopped forcing.
  She listened for the soft changes in pressure, the clay’s gentle insistence. Time
  thinned. Her hands became the place where intention moved through and fell away.
  A shape rose that surprised her—a vessel with a waist like a sigh, with a lip that
  seemed to drink the air.


  She fed the kiln and waited through the deep hours, listening to wood collapse to
  coals, to the mountain settle. She slept in scraps. At dawn, the kiln cooled enough
  to open. The vessel was not her grandmother’s. It was not any she had seen. Imperfect
  in ways that felt precise. Holding it, Maya felt a quiet answer move through her
  like clear water.


  She wrapped the vessel in cloth, but more than the weight of clay pressed against
  her ribs. On the descent, wind tugged, paths slid. Twice she nearly turned back,
  imagining the elders’ frowns, the whisper that she had failed the dead. A child
  in a passing caravan reached for the bundle, curious, and Maya felt her shoulders
  knot and loosen. The mountain had taught her to listen. She could carry that home.


  The village gathered by the cracked bed of the spring. The rocks were white with
  thirst. Maya set the vessel on the altar stone, palms hovering not in command but
  in consent. Sura lit a narrow taper. Maya poured no perfect words, only breath and
  attention, the careful ceremony her body wanted. She tilted the vessel; the air
  itself seemed to pour. Silence held, a beat long as a year. Then a dark thread appeared
  between stones and widened, trembling, as if remembering itself.


  A cheer rose and fell quiet, like rain moving away. Maya did not raise her arms.
  She felt something in her loosen and stand upright at once. She had carried a vessel
  and a way of working, and both had been tested. The self that had insisted on control
  washed out with the first rush, leaving a steadier ground.


  In the days that followed, water moved along the terraces; children ran with wet
  feet again. In her studio, Maya placed her grandmother’s journal where the light
  touched it in morning. Students watched her pause before the wheel. “Listen,” she
  told them. “Sometimes your hands are only the invitation.” Her shelves still held
  bowls and cups, but now and then a vessel rose that belonged to no one’s lineage
  and to the village at once. When she walked by the spring in the evening, steam
  lifted like a blessing, and she could almost hear it answer.'
