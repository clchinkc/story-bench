output: "The stained glass dome of the Buckingham Hotel fractured moonlight into spectral\
  \ pools across the decayed ballroom floor. Dante traced the lingering cobalt swirls—Rosa’s\
  \ calm—still clinging to a toppled chair. Footsteps echoed behind him. Lena emerged\
  \ from shadow, her arms crossed. \"Rosa trusted everyone,\" she spat. \"Look where\
  \ it got her. And you? A junkie who sees pretty colors.\" Dante’s knuckles whitened.\
  \ Three years clean, but the accusation stung like withdrawal. \"I’m here to find\
  \ her killer, not relive—\" \n\nA scream ripped through the hall. Resonants scattered\
  \ as a figure lunged from the gallery, hurling a canister that spewed choking crimson\
  \ mist—panic made visible. Gasping, Dante focused past the haze. Emotions bloomed\
  \ like toxic flowers: terror-yellow spikes, confusion-green spirals... and jagged\
  \ purple shards clinging to a retreating silhouette—betrayal. \"Him!\" Dante choked\
  \ out, pointing at Marco, Rosa’s supposed protégé. \"He’s working with the killer!\"\
  \ Marco fled, but not before Lena saw the truth in Dante’s strained gaze. She gripped\
  \ Dante’s arm, her suspicion thawing. \"You saw what I couldn’t.\" He wiped his\
  \ eyes, raw. \"Sobriety lets me see clearly. Even the ugly parts.\"\n\nIn a hidden\
  \ alcove reeking of damp plaster, Lena unrolled a tunnel map scavenged from Rosa’s\
  \ things. \"Marco’s meeting the killer below the old Red Line tracks. We go at dawn.\"\
  \ Dante traced the route—a labyrinth beneath the hotel’s foundations. His finger\
  \ trembled. Entering that darkness meant facing more than the killer; it meant descending\
  \ into the night his sister died. Lena pressed a vial into his hand—glowing liquid\
  \ resonance, Rosa’s last concoction. \"For courage,\" she murmured. At the rusted\
  \ service door, threshold to the underworld, Dante froze. Ghostly blue tendrils—his\
  \ own guilt—swirled at his feet. Lena’s hand on his shoulder was an anchor. \"She\
  \ wouldn’t want you drowning in this.\" He inhaled sharply, twisted the knob, and\
  \ stepped into the abyss.\n\nDank air swallowed them. Rails glinted like bones under\
  \ Lena’s flashlight. Ahead, Marco lay unconscious beside a whirring machine—copper\
  \ coils pulsing with stolen emotions. The killer emerged from shadows, his face\
  \ obscured, but his voice a serpent’s whisper. \"Hello, Dante. Your sister screamed\
  \ your name when the overdose hit.\" Dante’s knees buckled. Guilt—thick and suffocating—crashed\
  \ over him. Visions of his sister’s hollow eyes merged with Rosa’s corpse. He was\
  \ failing them all again. The killer seized Lena, pressing her wrist to the machine.\
  \ Jagged purple light flared across its surface—Marco’s betrayal pattern, now powering\
  \ the device. Recognition pierced Dante’s despair. Acceptance flowed cold and clear:\
  \ he couldn’t save his sister, but he could break the cycle. He hurled Rosa’s vial.\
  \ It shattered against the purple coil, short-circuiting the machine in a shower\
  \ of sparks. The killer shrieked as his own weapon backfired, draining him instead.\
  \ Dante rose, steady at last, and pulled Lena from the fading glow. The dead were\
  \ gone, but their colors lived in him—not as chains, but as compass points."
