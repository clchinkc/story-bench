output: 'Zoe Chen spent her summers at Millbrook Public Library, shelving books in
  the quiet stacks where she could disappear into other people''s stories. She liked
  the predictability, the way her own small life never had to be examined too closely.
  Talking to people terrified her. Even ordering coffee required rehearsal.


  But something was missing. At seventeen, she felt thin, hollow—like she was reading
  her own life rather than living it.


  When Ms. Okafor announced the oral history program, Zoe''s instinct was to hide.
  Record strangers'' voices? Stand in front of people? Her hand stayed down. Then
  Ms. Okafor found her in the stacks, holding a worn copy of Terkel''s *Working*.
  "You understand why stories matter," the librarian said, pressing a recorder into
  her hands. "Try one interview."


  Zoe said yes before she could refuse.


  The first interview with Bernard Park, eighty-nine, a Korean War veteran, was excruciating.
  She fumbled with the recorder. Her index cards shook. But she kept showing up—for
  Bernard, then for others. Slowly, something shifted. She learned that listening
  was a kind of courage, that silence could be a conversation. By summer''s fifth
  interview, the old residents began trusting her with their truths. Her mother called
  it a waste of a summer. Bernard called her brave.


  Then Bernard told her something he''d never told anyone: what really happened in
  Korea. The survival, the guilt, the small mercies that saved him. "You asked the
  right questions," he said. "I want people to know. Will you share it?"


  At the town hall, a hundred people sat in the audience. Zoe stood at the microphone,
  her voice steady as she spoke Bernard''s story into the room. When she finished,
  there was silence—then applause. Bernard''s handshake was trembling. "You heard
  me," he said, tears in his eyes. "That''s all any of us want."


  The program ended. Other volunteers moved on. But Zoe kept coming back to Bernard,
  kept recording, kept listening.


  In October, Bernard died. His family asked Zoe to speak at his funeral. This time,
  standing before the mourners, she wasn''t giving voice to someone else''s truth.
  She was speaking her own: what Bernard had taught her about listening, about courage,
  about the stories that connect us.


  Her mother still didn''t understand why Zoe spent weekends at the library instead
  of working retail. But something had changed. Zoe could order coffee now without
  rehearsing. More importantly, when she did it, she actually heard the barista''s
  answer. She asked questions. She listened.


  In her journalism school application essay, Zoe wrote about Millbrook''s forgotten
  voices—about Bernard, about the summer she learned that every person carries stories
  worth preserving. She wrote about discovering that shy girls could be brave simply
  by showing up and paying attention.


  She got in. In her dorm room, surrounded by strangers, Zoe didn''t hide anymore.
  She asked them about their lives. She listened. And in the listening, she found
  her own story finally beginning.'
