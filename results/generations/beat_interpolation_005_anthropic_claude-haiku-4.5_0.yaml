output: 'Three weeks into her employment, Maya found Alejandro in the kitchen at two
  in the morning, standing in front of the refrigerator''s open door like it might
  contain answers.


  "Couldn''t sleep?" she asked, keeping her voice soft.


  He flinched—actually flinched—before closing the door. "Just hungry."


  It was a lie. His face was drawn in a way she''d started to recognize meant he''d
  been thinking too hard about something painful. She''d noticed it before, usually
  around dusk, when he''d disappear into his study for hours.


  "Sit," she said, already moving toward the stove. "I''ll make you something real."


  She expected him to refuse, to retreat. Instead, he sat at the wooden counter—the
  one she''d cleaned and seasoned her second day here, shocked at how poorly maintained
  it was—and watched her work.


  She made *sofrito*, the way her grandmother had taught her: tomatoes, peppers, onions,
  garlic, all layered with time and patience. It was elemental cooking, the kind that
  required presence rather than performance.


  "My mother made this," Alejandro said. It wasn''t a question.


  Maya didn''t turn from the stove. "A lot of mothers do. It''s comfort."


  "I haven''t eaten it in fifteen years."


  Something in his voice broke open—a raw edge she''d never heard before. She plated
  the *sofrito* with fresh bread and placed it in front of him, then sat two stools
  away, not crowding his grief.


  He ate in silence. When he finished, his eyes were wet.


  "After the injury," he said quietly, "people stopped knowing what to do around me.
  They saw the ruined knee, the end of my career, and suddenly I was just... a problem
  to solve. Or avoid." He looked at her. "You don''t do that. You just cook. You just...
  exist with me."


  "That''s what people do for each other," Maya said.


  "Not in my experience."


  She reached across the counter and squeezed his wrist once—brief, certain—before
  pulling back. "Try having better people around you."


  Something shifted in his expression. He looked at her like he was seeing her for
  the first time, really seeing her: not the employee bound by contract, but the woman
  who chose to be here.


  "I don''t want you to leave," he said, and it cost him something, this confession.
  "When your six months is finished. I don''t want the contract to end."


  Her heart moved in her chest. This wasn''t about the salary anymore. This wasn''t
  about her grandmother''s restaurant or the money or survival. She was standing on
  the edge of something that had nothing to do with desperation and everything to
  do with choice.


  "Neither do I," she said.'
