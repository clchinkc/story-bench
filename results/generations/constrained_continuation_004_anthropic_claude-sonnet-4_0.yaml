output: 'Eleanor''s hands trembled as she turned the manuscript pages in the dim light
  of her father''s office. The writing was meticulous, detailed—too detailed. Her
  father had somehow acquired information about the Ripper''s crimes that hadn''t
  appeared in any newspaper. Locations, timings, evidence the police had withheld
  from the public.


  "Thomas," she whispered, "where did my father get this information?"


  Thomas shifted uncomfortably. "He had... connections. From his newspaper days. Contacts
  in the Metropolitan Police, people who trusted him." He paused. "Miss Blackwood,
  your father believed this story could sell enough copies to clear our debts threefold.
  The public''s appetite for Ripper news is insatiable."


  Eleanor set the pages down, her mind racing. Publishing this manuscript meant entering
  a world where proper Victorian ladies didn''t tread—sensational journalism, criminal
  investigation, the darkest corners of London society. Her father''s peers would
  ostracize her. The genteel customers who had tolerated her presence at the printing
  house during her father''s lifetime would flee.


  But William was in America, building his own life, and her father''s creditors wouldn''t
  wait for propriety.


  "The risks," she said. "If we publish this, we''re not just challenging social conventions.
  If my father''s sources were real, then someone gave him information they shouldn''t
  have. Someone who might not appreciate seeing it in print."


  Thomas nodded gravely. "The author who provides this level of detail about ongoing
  crimes... such a person makes dangerous enemies. But Miss Blackwood, if we don''t
  act, Blackwood & Sons dies anyway. At least this way, we fight."


  Eleanor walked to the window overlooking Fleet Street. Gas lamps flickered through
  the fog like dying stars. How many women had stood at similar crossroads, choosing
  between safety and survival? Her father had built this business from nothing, and
  she would not watch it crumble simply because society deemed her unfit to save it.


  "What would you need from me?" she asked.


  "Your signature on the publication contract. Your name on the business license applications
  we''ll need for distribution. Your presence at meetings with vendors and distributors
  who won''t deal with a Chinese man alone." Thomas''s voice carried years of suppressed
  frustration. "I can run this operation, Miss Blackwood, but I cannot be its public
  face. Together, we might succeed. Separately, we both fail."


  Eleanor turned from the window. Thomas stood straighter, and she recognized the
  steel beneath his deferential manner. He wasn''t just her father''s assistant—he
  was a man whose talent had been constrained by London''s prejudices, just as hers
  had been constrained by her sex.


  "If we do this," she said, "there''s no retreat. Once we publish these details about
  the Ripper, we''ll be connected to this story forever. The police may investigate
  how we obtained this information. The Ripper himself may take notice of us."


  "The alternative is bankruptcy and ruin."


  Eleanor picked up her father''s fountain pen, its weight familiar in her palm. She
  had watched him sign countless contracts with this same pen, never imagining she
  would one day wield it herself. The manuscript lay before her like a door—open it,
  and step into a world where ladies didn''t venture, where profit meant dancing with
  danger, where her father''s business might survive through her willingness to embrace
  scandal.


  She signed her name at the bottom of the title page with bold, decisive strokes:
  Eleanor Blackwood, Publisher.


  "Then we publish," she said. "God help us both."


  Thomas smiled—the first genuine expression she''d seen from him since her father''s
  death. "When do we begin?"


  "Tomorrow. Tonight, we plan our strategy for war."


  Outside, the November wind howled through London''s streets like something hunting.'
