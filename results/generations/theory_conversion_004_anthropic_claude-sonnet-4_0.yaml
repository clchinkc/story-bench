output: 'Zoe Chen lived in the spaces between other people''s stories. At seventeen,
  she spent her summers shelving books at Millbrook Public Library, disappearing into
  the quiet predictability of call numbers and due dates. She could navigate any story
  except her own.


  Something was missing, though she couldn''t name it. The books she loved most were
  filled with voices—oral histories, interviews, testimonies. Real people speaking
  real truths. But when the barista asked for her coffee order, Zoe''s voice dried
  up.


  When Ms. Okafor, the new librarian, announced a summer program interviewing Millbrook''s
  oldest residents, Zoe''s hand stayed firmly down. "Their stories deserve preservation,"
  Ms. Okafor explained. "I need volunteers." The idea terrified Zoe—talking to strangers,
  recording their voices, stepping into their lives.


  But Ms. Okafor found her hiding in the stacks. "I saw you reading Terkel''s ''Working.''
  You understand why stories matter." She pressed a recorder into Zoe''s trembling
  hands. "Just try."


  Zoe stumbled through her first interviews. Bernard Park, eighty-nine, Korean War
  veteran, watched patiently as she fumbled with her prepared questions. The second
  interview was worse. Her mother criticized the "waste of time" that could be spent
  on a "real job." But by the fifth visit, something shifted. Zoe stopped reading
  from index cards. She started listening.


  The old voices began trusting her. They shared coffee-shop gossip from the 1950s,
  descriptions of Millbrook''s vanished downtown, memories of children lost and found.
  Zoe discovered that listening was its own form of courage—not speaking, but creating
  space for others to speak.


  Bernard became her greatest teacher. One humid July afternoon, he looked directly
  at her. "I never told anyone what really happened in Korea. You''re the first person
  who ever asked the right questions." His story poured out—survival, guilt, choices
  that haunted him for sixty years. "Would you tell this story? At the town hall presentation?
  It needs to be heard."


  The town hall terrified her more than any nightmare. A hundred people waiting. Bernard''s
  story of war and grace burning in her chest. Zoe, who rehearsed coffee orders, stood
  at the microphone and gave voice to someone else''s truth. Her hands shook, but
  her voice held steady.


  The standing ovation mattered less than Bernard''s handshake afterward, his eyes
  wet. "You heard me," he whispered. "That''s all any of us want."


  Summer ended. The program concluded. Other volunteers drifted away, but Zoe kept
  visiting Bernard, kept recording, kept asking. She''d found something she hadn''t
  known she was searching for—not just her voice, but the understanding that voices
  mattered most when they carried others forward.


  When Bernard died in October, his family asked Zoe to speak at the funeral. This
  time, she wasn''t channeling someone else''s story. She shared her own: what Bernard
  had taught her about listening, about courage, about the threads that connect strangers
  into family.


  Senior year, Zoe applied to journalism programs. Her essay began: "In Millbrook''s
  forgotten voices, I found my own." She still rehearsed her coffee orders, still
  preferred books to crowds. But she''d learned something crucial—that her quiet listening
  could make room for truths that needed telling.


  The girl who once hid in library stacks now carried voices forward. She''d discovered
  that some stories could only be preserved by those brave enough to hear them fully.
  In learning to listen, she''d finally learned to speak.'
