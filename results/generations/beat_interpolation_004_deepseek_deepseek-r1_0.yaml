output: 'Thomas approached the witness stand, the note crumpled in his sweating palm.
  Dr. Okonkwo avoided his gaze, twisting her hands in her lap. "Dr. Okonkwo," he began,
  forcing calm into his voice, "you were head of research at Meridian Pharmaceuticals
  during the development of CardioFlex, correct?" She nodded mutely. "And you authored
  this internal memo dated March twelfth?" He held up the document. Her eyes darted
  toward the defense table where Meridian''s CEO gave an almost imperceptible nod.


  "Yes," she whispered. "But... I may have overstated the risks. Memory plays tricks..."
  Thomas''s chest tightened. She was recanting. He saw the terror in her—not of perjury
  charges, but of losing her child''s chance at life. Standard questions would bury
  the truth. His father''s stone-faced stare burned his back. Justice wasn''t negotiable.
  Unless you held the scalpel.


  He abandoned his prepared script. Stepping closer, he lowered his voice so only
  she could hear. "Seventeen families buried their loved ones believing CardioFlex
  was safe. Seventeen funerals." Her breath hitched. Thomas pressed on, gambling everything.
  "You swore an oath to do no harm. Right now, in this chair, you hold their only
  shot at justice. And yours." He placed the memo before her. "Did Meridian knowingly
  conceal fatal side effects?"


  Silence swallowed the courtroom. Dr. Okonkwo stared at the names of the dead listed
  in the appendix—names Thomas had added last night, praying they’d matter more than
  threats. A tear splashed onto the paper. She looked past the CEO’s smug grin, past
  Thomas, to where her husband sat clutching their daughter’s teddy bear. When she
  spoke, her voice rang clear as shattered glass. "Yes. We buried the reports. We
  knew." Gasps erupted as she described the hidden files, the manipulated data, the
  CEO’s direct orders. The truth, once loosed, flooded the room. Thomas watched Meridian’s
  smile curdle into disbelief. It was done.'
