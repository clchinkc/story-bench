output: 'The courtroom air was thick with the scent of polished wood and old leather,
  the kind of smell that had clung to Thomas’s father’s robes for decades. He adjusted
  his tie, the silk suddenly too tight, and stepped forward.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," he began, voice steady despite the storm inside him. "You were the
  lead researcher for Meridian’s Phase III trials for *Elysium-7*, correct?"


  She nodded, fingers twisting in her lap. "Yes."


  "And during those trials, you personally oversaw the adverse reaction reports?"


  Another nod. "I did."


  Thomas exhaled. "Then you’re aware that seventeen patients died from complications
  linked to the drug?"


  Her breath hitched. The defense attorney, a shark in a tailored suit, leaned forward.
  "Objection, Your Honor. Leading the witness."


  The judge’s gavel tapped once. "Sustained. Rephrase, Mr. Wright."


  Thomas didn’t flinch. "Dr. Okonkwo, what did you do when you first saw those reports?"


  She swallowed. "I—" Her voice cracked. The courtroom held its breath. "I flagged
  them for review."


  "Did Meridian act on those flags?"


  Her eyes darted to the defense table, where the CEO’s smile had sharpened. "No."


  Thomas stepped closer. "Why not?"


  Her hands trembled. "Because the trial was already behind schedule. The FDA approval
  was—"


  "More important than lives?" he pressed.


  The defense attorney shot up. "Objection! Argumentative!"


  "Withdrawn," Thomas said, but his gaze never left Dr. Okonkwo. He could see it—the
  fracture in her resolve, the way her shoulders hunched as if bracing for a blow.
  He thought of his father’s unyielding stare from the gallery, of the seventeen families
  who would never get closure if she lied now.


  Then he thought of her daughter.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," he said, softer now, "you have a daughter, don’t you?"


  Her head snapped up. The courtroom murmured.


  "Yes," she whispered.


  Thomas reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded paper. "This is a letter
  from Dr. Elena Vasquez at St. Mercy’s. She’s agreed to include your daughter in
  their experimental trial for *Neurogen-9*—no strings attached." He slid it across
  the witness stand. "No matter what you say today."


  The defense attorney’s protest died in his throat. The judge leaned forward.


  Dr. Okonkwo unfolded the letter with shaking hands. A tear slipped down her cheek.


  Thomas lowered his voice. "The truth doesn’t have to cost you everything."


  For a heartbeat, the courtroom was silent. Then she looked up, her voice steady
  for the first time.


  "The reports were buried," she said. "I signed off on it. And seventeen people died
  because of it."


  The defense erupted. The judge banged his gavel. But Thomas didn’t move. He just
  watched as Dr. Okonkwo’s shoulders squared, as the weight of her choice settled
  over her—not as a betrayal, but as a reckoning.


  The truth had won. And for the first time, it didn’t feel like enough.'
