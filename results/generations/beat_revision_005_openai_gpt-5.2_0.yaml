output: 'The apartment was dark when Maya finally unlocked the door. She didn’t bother
  with the lights. What was the point? The gallery had officially closed its doors
  that morning, twenty years of her mother’s legacy reduced to “LEASE AVAILABLE” signs
  taped inside the front window like a verdict.


  She sank onto the floor by the window, still wearing her coat. The city lights blurred
  through the glass—or maybe through her tears. She’d tried everything. The crowdfunding
  had fallen short. The investors had walked. Even her brother had finally stopped
  answering her calls, as if silence could keep him safe from her failure.


  Across the room, her mother’s last painting hung on the wall, barely visible in
  the darkness: a woman walking toward an unseen horizon. Maya remembered the hospice,
  the way the air had smelled like disinfectant and wilted flowers, the rise and fall
  of her mother’s chest getting shallower until Maya found herself counting breaths
  without meaning to. She’d held her mother’s hand and promised she’d keep the gallery
  alive. “It’s not about the art,” her mother had whispered, voice paper-thin. “It’s
  about having a place where people can feel something real.”


  Now the place was gone. The key on Maya’s ring suddenly felt useless, a piece of
  metal that no longer opened anything.


  She had failed that promise. Failed her mother. Failed herself.


  She pulled her knees to her chest and let the silence swallow her whole. Outside,
  the city kept moving—cars, sirens, life—but in here, time had stopped. The dark
  pressed close, thick as a closed lid. There was nothing left to do. No calls to
  make. No plans to execute. Just the weight of everything she’d lost sitting heavy
  on her lungs, as if the room itself had forgotten how to breathe.


  Tomorrow she’d have to figure out what comes next. But tonight, she let herself
  break.'
