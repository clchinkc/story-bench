output: 'The manuscript burned in Eleanor''s hands as she read it by candlelight that
  evening. Her father''s handwriting—cramped, urgent—filled page after page with details
  that no respectable publication would dare print. Witness accounts from Whitechapel''s
  streets. Theories about the killer''s identity. Speculation that implicated men
  of considerable standing.


  It was sensational. Irresponsible. Potentially libelous.


  It would sell ten thousand copies in a fortnight.


  "He interviewed the women themselves," Thomas said from the doorway of her father''s
  study—her study now, though the thought still felt like wearing a coat cut for someone
  else. "The ones who survive by walking those streets. He believed their voices mattered."


  Eleanor set the pages down. "And what do you believe, Mr. Chen?"


  Thomas stepped into the lamplight, and she saw the exhaustion etched into his features.
  He had worked beside her father for ten years, yet convention would never allow
  him to own such a business himself. His future was as precarious as hers—more so,
  perhaps. If Blackwood & Sons failed, no other printing house would hire him for
  anything beyond menial labor.


  "I believe your father was a good man who wanted to do something meaningful before
  he died," Thomas said carefully. "I also believe this manuscript could destroy everything
  he built, or it could save it. The question is whether you''re willing to take that
  gamble."


  "The question," Eleanor corrected, "is whether I''m willing to profit from tragedy.
  From women''s deaths."


  "Those women are already dead, Miss Blackwood. The question is whether their stories
  die with them."


  She turned to the window. Fog pressed against the glass like something alive, hungry.
  Somewhere in that grey shroud, the Whitechapel killer walked free, and London''s
  newspapers churned out lurid speculation daily. Her father''s manuscript was different—intimate,
  human, focused on the victims rather than the monster. But would readers see that
  distinction? Would she be memorializing the dead or exploiting them?


  The creditors'' letter sat on her desk. Three months. Perhaps.


  "If we publish this," she said slowly, "we announce to London that a woman is running
  Blackwood & Sons. The pseudonym protects the author, but not the publisher. Every
  editor in the city will know it was my decision."


  "Yes."


  "They''ll say I''m desperate. Sensationalist. Unfit for commerce."


  "They''ll say worse than that." Thomas''s voice was steady. "Does it matter?"


  Eleanor thought of her father''s hands, ink-stained and gentle, teaching her to
  set type when she was a girl. He had never said the words aloud—that he wished she
  had been his heir—but she had felt it in every stolen lesson, every book he pressed
  into her hands.


  She picked up her pen and began drafting the advertisement for the first installment.
  "We print on Friday. Serial format, weekly releases. Price it for the working class—they''re
  the ones living in fear."


  "Miss Blackwood." Thomas''s voice held a warning. "Whoever the Ripper is, your father''s
  manuscript suggests connections to powerful men. If we publish this, those men will
  know your name. Your address."


  The pen did not waver.


  "Then we had better make certain the first installment sells well enough to afford
  better locks."


  She signed her name at the bottom of the advertisement—not her father''s name, not
  a pseudonym, but her own. Eleanor Blackwood, Publisher. Let London see it. Let them
  talk.


  Outside, the fog thickened, and somewhere in its depths, a church bell tolled midnight.
  Eleanor did not look up. She was already calculating print runs, distribution routes,
  the mathematics of survival.


  The threshold was crossed. There would be no going back.'
