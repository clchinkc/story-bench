output: "Maya’s days began with salt-damp breezes and ended with patient circles of\
  \ the wheel. In the coastal village of Tilarin she fired only modest bowls and cups—pieces\
  \ meant to hold rice, fish, and tea, never legends. Her grandmother’s towering ceremonial\
  \ vessels, once praised by distant temples, stood forgotten in a locked shed. Maya\
  \ told herself that kind of greatness required a flame she did not possess. The\
  \ only pressing worry was the village spring, now a cracked hollow where children\
  \ rattled dry gourds for sound they pretended was water.\n\nOne dusk the council\
  \ of elders gathered outside her workshop. “The spring is the village’s lifeblood,”\
  \ the eldest woman said. “The clay remembers what we have forgotten. Craft a vessel\
  \ worthy of the mountain spirits and the water will flow.” In the hush that followed,\
  \ Maya felt every eye measure her against the memory of her grandmother.  \n\n“I’m\
  \ a teacher of simple wares,” she answered. “Ask another.” But there was no other;\
  \ the art had withered to her alone. When the elders left, she sealed the kiln and\
  \ tried to sleep. Instead dreams came: fire racing across clay that turned to water,\
  \ a voice—perhaps her grandmother’s—whispering, Let go.\n\nMorning found her at\
  \ the shed, fingers tracing dust-thick rims once shaped by the woman who’d bounced\
  \ her on a hip and smelled of smoke and river mud. Inside a cracked tool chest she\
  \ discovered a small leather sketchbook, its blank first page pierced with three\
  \ words: The mountain shrine. The book felt warm, as though it had waited for her\
  \ touch. On impulse she slipped it into her satchel.\n\nStill, when fishermen asked\
  \ if she would go, she shook her head. Alone up that peak? Impossible. Yet each\
  \ night the dreams widened, until sleep itself became a kiln she could not leave.\
  \ Finally she sought the oldest potter still living, a man who fired roof tiles\
  \ now that no one ordered art. He listened, then pressed a rough shard into her\
  \ palm. “Your grandmother shattered this jar on purpose,” he murmured. “She said\
  \ perfection is the enemy of flow. Don’t chase her shadow—follow the crack.” His\
  \ crooked smile felt like a blessing and a challenge at once.\n\nAt dawn Maya stepped\
  \ onto the cliff road, sea behind her, mountains ahead. The first day’s ascent blistered\
  \ her heels; by evening rain soaked her clay packs. A shepherd boy led her to a\
  \ cave where embers still glowed, trading warmth for a simple bowl she’d shaped\
  \ on the spot. Wind shrieked through crevasses, mocking her resolve. More than once\
  \ she pictured herself returning with the excuse of broken tools, but the sketchbook\
  \ in her satchel pulsed like a drumbeat: onward.\n\nOn the third night jagged silhouettes\
  \ of collapsed columns marked the shrine. Ivy strangled the walls, and the kiln\
  \ lay toppled like a dead beast. She almost wept—until moonlight revealed a pit\
  \ of fine gray clay, untouched. Kneeling, she opened the sketchbook. The pages were\
  \ suddenly filled, not with instructions, but with fragments of her grandmother’s\
  \ script: Hold nothing. Let the vessel want itself.  \n\nMaya gathered clay, rebuilt\
  \ the kiln’s mouth with fallen bricks, and fed a fire of pine needles that snapped\
  \ and spat resin. When the wheel refused to spin, she placed the lump on a flat\
  \ stone and, closing her eyes, pressed from center outward, palms guided by pulse\
  \ rather than plan. Hours dissolved. At dawn a form stood before her—slender as\
  \ rain, wide as surf, grooves running like ripples from base to lip. It looked nothing\
  \ like her grandmother’s stately urns. It looked alive.\n\nWarm ashes coated the\
  \ vessel as she lifted it. In that moment she understood the shard’s lesson: surrender\
  \ had shaped what skill alone never could. The mountain accepted the offering; now\
  \ she must carry it back.\n\nThe descent tested her more bitterly than the climb.\
  \ Winds threatened to wrench the vessel from her arms; loose stones slid beneath\
  \ her feet. Once she set the piece beside the trail, meaning to rest, and felt a\
  \ sudden freeing thought: leave it, forget the spring, return to teaching. The notion\
  \ felt sweet for a heartbeat, then hollow. She gathered the vessel and pressed on.\n\
  \nBy the time she reached Tilarin, the village well was a ring of cracked mud. Villagers\
  \ watched her approach in expectant silence. Kneeling at the barren mouth, she placed\
  \ the vessel inside the ring, its rim level with the parched earth. She poured a\
  \ ladle of clear glaze, whispering the only words that came: Clay remembers. I release.\
  \ For a breath nothing happened. Then a dark stain spread beneath the vessel. Water\
  \ rose, slow but certain, lapping the rim, spilling over the dust.\n\nCheers burst,\
  \ but Maya felt quiet inside, as though another spring had opened within her chest.\
  \ The elders bowed, yet she shook her head. “The clay spoke,” she said simply. She\
  \ spent that evening teaching children to wedge lumps of riverbed silt, urging them\
  \ to close their eyes and listen.\n\nUnder lantern light she set the empty sketchbook\
  \ on her worktable. Inked on the last page were fresh words in her own hand, though\
  \ she did not recall writing them: Break the bowl if it cages the river. She smiled,\
  \ dipped her brush, and began the first lesson of her own legacy."
