output: 'The roar of Formula 1 engines ricocheting off the Monte Carlo cliffs provided
  excellent acoustic cover for breaking glass, though Miri preferred not to break
  anything at all. Standing in the VIP lounge of the *Tsarina*, swirling a glass of
  vintage Krug, she looked less like a thief and more like another bored socialite
  waiting for the race to end.


  "Leo, talk to me," she murmured, tapping her pearl earring. "The oligarch is distracted.
  He’s currently explaining cryptocurrency to a swimsuit model."


  "I’m in the localized grid," Leo’s voice crackled, young and usually overly confident,
  though the sheer scale of Sorokin’s security had him tapping faster than usual.
  "Disabling the pressure sensors in the private gallery in three... two..."


  Across the room, a heavy velvet curtain twitched. That was Baz, their muscle disguised
  as a catering waiter. He was wrestling a fifteen-liter Nebuchadnezzar of champagne
  into a specialized service dumbwaiter built into the mahogany wall.


  "This lift is ridiculous, Miri," Baz grumbled over the comms. "It’s reinforced titanium.
  You could ship a tank engine down to the tender bay in this thing, but they use
  it for oversized booze."


  "It’s Russian money, Baz. Practicality is a sin," Miri whispered, turning her back
  to the party. "Is the shaft clear?"


  "Clear. It drops straight to the waterline level for easy loading. But the hydraulics
  are loud."


  "The cars are louder. Go."


  Miri slipped behind the velvet rope as Baz triggered the lift, the mechanical whine
  swallowed by the scream of a Ferrari passing the harbor. She approached the target:
  *The Weeping Saint*. It was smaller than she remembered, but the brushwork was unmistakable.
  With practiced fluidity, she produced a suction tool from her clutch. The glass
  face of the climate-controlled casing popped open with a sigh.


  "Easy as stealing candy from a baby," Leo crowed in her ear. "A very rich, very
  dangerous baby."


  "Don''t get cocky, kid," Miri said, swapping the masterpiece for a high-quality
  print mounted on identical canvas. "We’re not out yet. And the lock on this frame...
  it’s sticky. Someone greased the tumblers recently."


  "Maintenance?"


  "No," Miri frowned, securing the stolen canvas into a slender, cylindrical tube
  strapped to her thigh beneath her gown. "Maintenance cleans. They don''t modify."


  The heist was technically complete. The painting was on her person. The forgery
  was in place. Miri stepped back into the lounge just as the checkered flag waved
  on the track, sending the party into a chaotic eruption of cheers. She felt the
  familiar rush of a job well done, the electric hum of adrenaline that usually signaled
  time for a martini.


  But as she moved toward the exit, her gaze snagged on a bank of security monitors
  behind the bar, left carelessly exposed by a distracted bartender. The feed showed
  the server room where Leo was holed up. But it wasn''t the image that stopped her
  heart; it was the code scrolling across the bottom of the screen.


  It was a jagged, aggressive firewall script. A "Vance Loop."


  "Leo," Miri said, her voice dropping the playful lilt. "Get out of the server room.
  Now."


  "What? I’m scrubbing the logs. I need two minutes."


  "You don''t have two minutes. We’ve been made." Miri scanned the crowd, the glamour
  of the yacht suddenly feeling like the walls of a cage. Her eyes locked onto a figure
  standing on the upper balcony, looking down not at the race, but directly at her.


  Eleanor Vance. Her gray hair was cut in the same sharp bob Miri had admired fifteen
  years ago, before Eleanor had planted the evidence that destroyed Miri’s life. Eleanor
  wasn''t just a guest; she was Sorokin’s head of security. She raised a glass of
  champagne toward Miri, a shark-like smile cutting across her face.


  "Leo, listen to me," Miri hissed, moving against the flow of the cheering crowd.
  "It’s Eleanor. She let us get this far. She wanted me to take the painting so she
  could pin a fresh felony on me in international waters."


  "Eleanor? The one who taught you?" Leo’s confidence evaporated, replaced by the
  high pitch of panic. "My screens just went red. I’m locked out. Miri, the doors
  to the server room are sealing."


  The stakes had shifted violently. This wasn''t a retrieval mission anymore; it was
  a grudge match, and Miri had walked right into the kill box. The air in the lounge
  felt thin. Security guards in earpieces were beginning to weave through the revelers,
  their movements coordinated and sharp. They weren''t looking for a thief; they were
  closing a net.


  "Baz, abort the exit strategy," Miri ordered, dodging a waiter. "Head to the lower
  deck."


  "I can''t," Baz replied, his voice strained. "They’ve got the stairwells blocked.
  I’m in the galley. They’re flushing the ship."


  Miri paused near the mahogany wall. She could see Eleanor descending the grand staircase,
  moving with the terrifying grace of a predator who has already won. Miri’s hand
  hovered over the tube on her leg. She could drop the painting, surrender, and try
  to talk her way out—confront Eleanor, scream the truth to the room, get the revenge
  she’d fantasized about for a decade. Or she could finish the job.


  "Miri, they’re cutting through the door!" Leo shouted.


  "Hold on, kid." Miri looked at Eleanor, then at the reinforced champagne lift Baz
  had complained about earlier.


  The guards were ten feet away. Eleanor was twenty. Miri threw her clutch at a waiter,
  causing a spray of glass and distraction, and dove into the galley service area.


  "Baz, the Nebuchadnezzar lift. Open it!"


  "It’s full of empty bottles!"


  "Dump them!"


  Miri slid into the galley just as Baz kicked a crate of glass aside. The small,
  titanium-lined box hummed open. It was tight—too tight for a person, unless that
  person was willing to dislocate a shoulder.


  "Leo is trapped," Miri said, the decision crystallizing in the heat of the moment.
  She couldn''t save Leo *and* fight Eleanor. She looked at the painting tube. "Baz,
  take the art. Put it in the lift. Send it down to the tender. You go with it."


  "What about you?" Baz demanded, shoving the tube into the dumbwaiter.


  "I’m going to the server room," Miri said, grabbing a magnum of champagne by the
  neck like a club. "Leo can''t climb, and he can''t fight."


  "Miri, that’s suicide. Eleanor will tear you apart."


  "She taught me everything I know," Miri said, her smile brittle and terrifying.
  "Let''s see if she taught me everything *she* knows."


  She hit the button. The lift whirred, carrying the painting—and the mission—down
  to safety. Miri turned back toward the door, where the heavy boots of security were
  thundering closer, leaving the art behind to save the hacker, and stepping directly
  into the fire.'
