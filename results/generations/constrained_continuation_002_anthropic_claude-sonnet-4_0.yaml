output: 'Within an hour, the blogger''s intended insult had backfired spectacularly.
  Comments flooded in defending the "brave fusion pioneers" and demanding to know
  where they could try these mysterious paneer tacos. The electric pink bus became
  a beacon for Austin''s notorious food adventurers.


  "Order up!" Priya shouted, sliding another plate through the window. The line now
  stretched around the block, a mix of curious millennials, intrigued locals, and
  food bloggers documenting every bite.


  Dev moved with surprising grace in the cramped kitchen space, his methodical approach
  perfectly complementing Priya''s controlled chaos. When the paneer ran low, he''d
  already prepped backup portions. When she needed cilantro, he handed it over before
  she asked.


  "Behind you," he called, spinning past her with a tray of fresh naan.


  "This is actually working," Priya breathed during a brief lull.


  "Don''t jinx it," Dev replied, but he was smiling.


  That''s when the competition arrived.


  A pristine black truck with gold lettering pulled up across the street: "Lone Star
  Luxury – Gourmet Street Food." The owner, a sharp-dressed man with perfectly styled
  hair, stepped out and surveyed their operation with calculating eyes.


  "Marcus Chen," Dev muttered. "Food Network darling. He''s got three trucks and a
  cookbook deal."


  Marcus approached their window with predatory confidence. "Congratulations on the
  viral moment. Very...authentic." His smile could cut glass. "I''m Marcus Chen. Perhaps
  we could collaborate sometime."


  Priya matched his smile with one of her own. "Thanks, but we''re good."


  "Of course. Well, competition keeps everyone sharp, doesn''t it?" He gestured toward
  his truck. "May the best fusion win."


  As Marcus walked away, customers began gravitating toward the shinier option. Priya
  watched their line dwindle, but refused to panic.


  "We need a differentiator," Dev said quietly.


  Priya grabbed the megaphone they''d bought as a joke. "Attention, Austin! Free butter
  chicken samples for the rest of the day! Made with my actual grandmother''s recipe!"


  The crowd surged back. Within minutes, they were slammed again, this time with customers
  specifically requesting Priya''s grandmother''s recipes. The personal story resonated
  in ways Marcus''s polished operation couldn''t match.


  By closing time, they''d sold out completely. Social media buzzed with photos of
  their food, tagged with #GrandmasRevenge and #PaneerPioneer. Food & Wine magazine
  had called requesting an interview.


  "We did it," Dev said, collapsing against the counter. For the first time since
  they''d started this venture, his perpetual worry lines had smoothed. "We actually
  did it."


  Priya felt the same euphoria, mixed with exhaustion and disbelief. They''d proven
  everyone wrong – her parents, the permit office bureaucrat who''d smirked at their
  application, even her own nagging doubts.


  Her phone rang. The caller ID made her stomach drop.


  "What is it?" Dev asked, seeing her expression.


  Priya stared at the screen. "It''s the health inspector. Someone filed a complaint."


  Through the window, she could see Marcus Chen''s truck still parked across the street,
  its owner nowhere to be seen. In the distance, a white sedan with city plates was
  pulling into the lot.


  Their perfect day was about to become their biggest test yet.'
