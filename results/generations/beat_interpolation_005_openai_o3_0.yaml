output: 'Maya found him in the cavernous kitchen after midnight, barefoot, a single
  lamp pooling light over the marble island. Alejandro stood at the stove in sweatpants
  and an old club jersey, wooden spoon dangling from fingers clenched white with effort.
  A pot of rice bubbled, scorched at the edges.


  “I thought everyone was asleep,” he said, not facing her.


  “Everyone except the insomniacs.” She crossed to the burner and lowered the flame.
  “What are you making?”


  “Arroz con leche,” he muttered. “My mother’s. Except it tastes wrong.” He tried
  to lift the pot, but his right hand spasmed; the spoon clattered to the floor. He
  backed away, jaw set, as if she’d witnessed something indecent.


  Maya picked up the spoon, rinsed it, and tested the rice. “Too little milk, too
  much heat,” she said gently. “And you’re stirring with your off hand.”


  His shoulders stiffened. “The good one cramps in cold weather.” The confession hung
  between them, fragile as sugar glass. Reporters had speculated endlessly about the
  injury that ended his career; none had ever heard it from him.


  Maya opened the pantry, gathering cinnamon, lemon peel, and the last of the fresh
  cream. “Let me try? Not as a chef. As someone whose abuela believed warm milk could
  mend any sorrow.”


  He hesitated, then nodded. They cooked in companionable silence, steam fogging the
  dark windows. When the pudding thickened, she ladled two bowls and guided him to
  the terrace. The sea was black velvet, stitched with silver moonlight.


  Alejandro tasted a spoonful, closed his eyes, and exhaled. “This is it,” he said,
  voice rough. “I haven’t tasted this since before she died.”


  Maya’s chest tightened. “Food remembers for us,” she whispered. “That’s why I never
  leave a recipe behind.”


  He looked at her then, truly looked, and the distance he wore like armor slipped.
  “Why did you come here, really?”


  “For my grandmother’s restaurant,” she admitted. She saw disappointment flicker
  and surprised herself by adding, “But that’s not why I’m staying.” The words felt
  like stepping onto a rope bridge—no solid ground behind, only the pull of something
  terrifyingly possible ahead. “I want to cook for you, not just your public face.
  For the man who misses his mother’s arroz con leche.”


  Alejandro’s smile was tentative, hopeful. “Then we start tomorrow?”


  “Tomorrow,” she agreed, knowing there was no return to the safe distance of employer
  and employee—only forward, together.'
