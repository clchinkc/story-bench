output: 'Eleanor sat in her father’s high-backed leather chair, the material cold
  against her mourning dress. The gaslight hissed above, casting long, wavering shadows
  against shelves lined with unsold encyclopedias. Outside, the London fog pressed
  against the windowpane, a gray ghost seeking entry. She turned the page of the manuscript,
  her fingers trembling not from the chill, but from the words scrawled in her father’s
  familiar hand.


  It wasn''t fiction. It was too precise. The details regarding the canonical five—the
  specific mutilations, the timing of the patrols, the geography of the shadows—mirrored
  the police reports she had read in the broadsheets, yet contained terrifying specifics
  the papers had omitted. If this was a "true account," her father hadn''t just imagined
  a killer; he had known one. Or worse, he had watched one.


  "It is grotesque," Eleanor whispered, looking up at Thomas. He stood by the hearth,
  stoking the dying embers. "To sell this... to peddle fear for shillings while the
  blood is still wet on the cobblestones. It makes us no better than the penny dreadfuls."


  Thomas turned, the firelight catching the sharp angles of his face. "It is survival,
  Miss Blackwood. The creditors will seize the presses by Friday. My family relies
  on my wages. Without Blackwood & Sons, I am merely another foreigner in a city that
  despises me. We do not have the luxury of high morals."


  His words struck a hard chord. This wasn''t just about her legacy; it was about
  the livelihoods tethered to it. Thomas had protected this house when her brother
  abandoned it. Yet, the danger vibrated off the pages. If the police saw this, they
  would ask questions she couldn''t answer. If the *killer* saw this...


  "Father risked everything for this," she mused, closing the folder. "Why?"


  "Because the truth has value," Thomas said, stepping closer, his voice dropping.
  "And because he believed you were strong enough to handle it. He didn''t send for
  William, Eleanor. He left it to you."


  She stood, the heavy skirts of her dress rustling like dry leaves. The room felt
  too small, the air too thick with the scent of old paper and stale tobacco. She
  walked to the window. Below, on Fleet Street, a carriage clattered over cobblestones,
  disappearing into the mist.


  "If we publish," Eleanor said, her voice hardening, "we become targets. This text
  exposes things meant to stay hidden in the fog. It implicates powerful men."


  "We publish anonymously," Thomas countered. "We distribute through the underground
  sellers in the East End. We create a phantom author."


  Eleanor looked at her reflection in the darkened glass. A grieving daughter stared
  back, pale and constrained by corsets and custom. Society expected her to weep,
  sell the assets, and vanish into spinsterhood. Publishing this manuscript was an
  act of rebellion, a desecration of proper mourning, and a declaration of war against
  the silence of the city.


  "Prepare the press, Thomas."


  Thomas blinked, surprised by the steel in her tone. "Tonight?"


  "Tonight. The workers are gone. We do it ourselves. I will not trust this text to
  eyes that might betray us before the ink is dry."


  They descended into the bowels of the building. The press room was a cavern of iron
  and grease, a mechanical beast sleeping in the dark. It was a man’s world, smelling
  of oil and sweat, a place she had been barred from entering since childhood. Eleanor
  rolled up her sleeves, exposing pale wrists to the grime, discarding the gloves
  that marked her station.


  "Show me how to set the type," she commanded.


  As they worked, the silence of the building felt heavy, watchful. When Eleanor reached
  for a tray of lead letters, she noticed the rear door—the one leading to the alley—was
  unlatched. A damp draft curled around her ankles, carrying the scent of coal smoke.
  She froze. Hadn''t Thomas locked it?


  "Is something wrong?" Thomas asked, his hands stained with ink.


  "Just the wind," she lied, though the fine hairs on her neck stood upright. Someone
  was watching. She could feel the weight of a gaze from the shadows beyond the door,
  a presence testing the perimeter.


  She shoved the fear down, channeling it into the motion of the wheel. She locked
  the typeset into place. There was no going back now. The debt was too high, the
  secret too loud. Eleanor Blackwood pulled the lever. The great machine roared to
  life, a rhythmic, thundering heartbeat that shook the floorboards, drowning out
  the city outside and churning out the first page of a story that might kill them
  both.'
