output: 'The airlock hissed open, revealing a corridor that smelled of ozone and recycled
  desperation. Unlike the sterile, white corridors of the Council’s labs, the Free
  Orbital Collective was a chaotic mosaic of retrofitted modules and flickering LED
  strips. Jin clutched his data drive, expecting a hero’s welcome, but the crowd flowed
  around him like water around a stone. Here, refugees were common currency, and his
  treason warrant was merely another barcode on his forehead. The "freedom" he had
  imagined was actually a suffocating bureaucracy of survival.


  He needed a terminal. He needed to broadcast the files before the Council’s signal
  jamming reached this altitude. But every public screen demanded credits he didn’t
  have, and the locals viewed his frantic questions with hostile indifference. He
  was a ghost in a machine that didn’t care about his moral high ground. The station’s
  political landscape was a minefield of factional squabbles, and without a patron,
  he was nothing.


  Desperation eventually led him to the lower sectors, where gravity fluctuated and
  the lighting failed. There, he found an old woman soldering wires in an open-wall
  workshop, her eyes magnified by thick lenses. Her name was Mara. She didn’t ask
  about his crimes; she asked if he could work. When he explained his mission to expose
  the Council, she laughed, a dry, rasping sound that echoed off the bulkheads.


  "You think you’re the first martyr to wash up here?" Mara asked, setting down her
  torch. "The Collective doesn’t extradite, but we don’t give platforms. We give silence.
  That’s the price of safety."


  Despite her cynicism, she saw his resolve. She took him to a secluded hub, a server
  farm maintained by defectors from the very Council Jin had fled. "You want to finish
  what you started?" she asked, typing a command into a dusty keyboard. "Look."


  She pulled up the schematics for the carbon capture lattice. Jin froze. The data
  on his drive—the proof he had sacrificed his life for—was already in the system.
  It was dated three years prior.


  "The Council didn''t suppress it because it didn''t work," Mara said, watching his
  face closely. "They suppressed it because it works too well. The process destabilizes
  the upper atmosphere if deployed without orbital stabilizers. The Collective has
  the stabilizers. Earth has the deployment sites. If you release your proof now,
  you prove Earth lied, but you also prove that the Collective has been holding the
  cure hostage to maintain independence."


  The revelation hollowed him out. He had come to expose a villain, only to find that
  his saviors were just another breed of jailer. If he broadcast the data, war would
  break out between the planet and the stations—a conflict that would destroy the
  very people he tried to save. If he stayed silent, the suppression continued.


  "We can finish the tech together," Mara said, offering him a chair at the console.
  "But we do it our way. Slowly. Negotiated. Not through leaks and chaos."


  Jin looked at the drive in his hand, then at the terminal connected to the station’s
  grid. He could hit ''send'' and burn it all down, a final act of defiance. Or he
  could sit down, learn the system, and become part of the slow, grinding machinery
  of realpolitik.


  He slid the drive into the slot. The screen accepted the encryption. He had found
  his safety, his platform, but as the files merged into the Collective’s restricted
  archive, he felt the weight of his own silence settle over him. He was no longer
  an exile. He was an accomplice.'
