output: 'Detective Rachel Torres swung the closet door shut with her elbow, balancing
  a travel mug and a cat named Sherlock, who insisted on a last shoulder ride before
  she left. The tuxedo tom leapt down to bat at an envelope addressed to her father.
  Rachel brushed the badge-shaped return stamp with a thumb. “He’s retired, pal,”
  she murmured, tucking the letter onto the table beside a tarnished precinct mug.
  Queens traffic rumbled outside; sirens stitched the cool air.


  A gusty Tuesday morning in October greeted her at the curb. On her sedan’s passenger
  seat lay a manila folder thick with long-closed files. Sherlock’s stray hairs clung
  to it—reminders of the night she’d lifted the trembling cat from a crime scene hallway
  and promised better floors.


  Riverside Precinct buzzed when she arrived. Rookie Morales called, “Still first
  in, Torres? One day I’ll meet the ghost who turns on the lights.” She raised her
  mug in salute.


  Detective James Oyelaran intercepted her at the case board, pinning fresh burglary
  reports beside red-thread maps. Without looking away, he handed her a paper cup.
  “No sugar, extra bitter—figured you’d need it.”


  “Read my mind again?” she asked.


  “Cold morning. Cold cases.” The exchange was routine, practiced over countless shifts.


  Their gazes landed on an empty square beneath UNSOLVED HOMICIDE. Rachel’s fingers
  drifted to the pinned photos, eyes narrowing at details others missed. James nudged
  the board sideways to give her room—wordless permission.


  For the moment, the city still followed yesterday’s rules, but the phone beside
  the board began to ring, cutting through the hum like a warning bell.'
