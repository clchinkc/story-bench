output: 'The scent of saffron and slow-roasted lamb filled the villa. Maya watched
  Alejandro across the polished oak table, meticulously dissecting a potato dauphinoise.
  He hadn’t spoken much since she’d started, but lately, the silences felt less like
  a chasm and more like a comfortable space. Tonight, though, something was different.


  “This… this tastes like home,” he murmured, a rare softness in his voice. He looked
  up, his eyes, usually guarded, now holding a distant melancholy. “My grandmother
  used to make something similar. She was the one who taught me to love food, before…
  before everything else took over.”


  He gestured vaguely, encompassing the grand room, his own fame, the reclusive life.
  It was the most personal thing he’d ever shared. Maya’s heart gave a strange lurch.
  She saw not the difficult legend, but a man haunted by loss. She leaned forward,
  forgetting the contract, forgetting the money. “What was she like?”


  Alejandro smiled then, a genuine, unguarded smile that transformed his face, chasing
  away years of shadows. He spoke of sun-drenched afternoons in a small kitchen, of
  laughter and flour-dusted hands. For a long moment, the world outside the villa,
  the debts, the tabloids, ceased to exist. It was just Maya and Alejandro, sharing
  a quiet, fragile intimacy over a meal.


  When he finally pushed his plate away, the easy camaraderie lingered. "Thank you,
  Maya," he said, his gaze holding hers. "For tonight. For the food."


  A warmth spread through Maya, deeper than professional pride. This wasn’t just about
  her grandmother’s restaurant anymore. It was about seeing *him*, truly seeing the
  man beneath the myth. She found herself wanting to ease his burdens, to bring more
  of that genuine smile back. The six months stretched ahead, no longer a prison sentence,
  but an opportunity. She would stay. Not just for the money, but for this. For him.'
