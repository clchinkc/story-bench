output: "The air in the courtroom thickened as Thomas approached Dr. Okonkwo, his\
  \ heart pounding with the weight of the moment. He cleared his throat, focusing\
  \ on her trembling hands. “Dr. Okonkwo, can you describe the drug trial processes\
  \ at Meridian?”\n\nShe glanced at the jury, her gaze wavering. “They were rushed...incomplete.”\
  \ Her voice was barely above a whisper.\n\n“Were you aware of the adverse reactions\
  \ reported?” Thomas pressed, his tone steady yet urgent. He sensed the unease in\
  \ her demeanor, the way she shifted in her chair. “Did you ever question the integrity\
  \ of the results?”\n\nDr. Okonkwo hesitated, her breath catching. “I… I didn’t want\
  \ to believe…” She looked toward the defense table, where the CEO’s smug confidence\
  \ loomed like a dark cloud. “They promised me—”\n\n“Stop,” Thomas interrupted, leaning\
  \ forward, his expression fierce. “They promised you what? A future for your daughter?\
  \ But at what cost? You know what that decision means for others.”\n\nHer eyes glistened\
  \ with unshed tears. “I can’t lose her. If I testify, they’ll—”\n\n“You’ll lose\
  \ more if you don’t. Seventeen lives. Their families. You can’t sacrifice the truth\
  \ to protect yourself or your daughter.” The words hung between them, heavy with\
  \ the weight of consequence.\n\nThe courtroom waited, breaths held. Thomas took\
  \ a deep breath, then continued, “Dr. Okonkwo, think of those families. Would you\
  \ want to live with that burden? Justice isn’t just a word; it’s a choice we make\
  \ every day.”\n\nA flicker of determination sparked in her eyes. “I… I just want\
  \ my daughter to be safe,” she said, her voice trembling. \n\n“And she will be,”\
  \ Thomas urged gently, desperation clawing at him. “You can’t turn your back on\
  \ those who can’t defend themselves, or you’ll just become part of the system that\
  \ failed them.”\n\nHe saw her resolve shifting, a storm of fear and righteousness\
  \ battling within her. “You’re right,” she finally whispered, the truth emerging\
  \ from her lips like a fragile flame. “I will testify.”\n\nWith those words, the\
  \ courtroom exhaled. Thomas felt the swell of hope rise as Dr. Okonkwo squared her\
  \ shoulders, ready to face the truth, ready to confront the darkness. The turning\
  \ point had come—justice was not just a possibility; it was the only choice left."
