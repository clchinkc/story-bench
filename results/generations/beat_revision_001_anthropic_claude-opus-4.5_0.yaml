output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. Its voice slithered into her
  mind, carrying images she''d buried deep. "I see the boy in your memories. Your
  brother. You let him die."


  Kira''s breath caught. "That''s not—"


  "You heard him scream. You hid." The dragon''s burning eyes narrowed with cruel
  knowing. "You could have saved him. You chose yourself instead."


  She raised her sword and charged, desperate to silence the truth.


  The battle was brutal. Flame scorched her armor. Claws raked across her shield.
  Three times she was knocked down, and three times she rose again—but each time,
  the dragon''s whispers cut deeper than its claws.


  *Coward. Failure. You wear a hero''s armor over a coward''s heart.*


  The third blow sent her sprawling at the chasm''s edge. Her sword clattered away.
  She couldn''t rise. The guilt she''d carried for years crushed her chest, heavier
  than any wound.


  "Yes," the dragon purred, looming over her. "Die knowing what you are."


  In that darkness, Kira stopped fighting the memory. She saw her brother''s face—not
  screaming, but smiling. *Live*, he had told her. *Live and be brave enough for both
  of us.*


  She hadn''t hidden out of cowardice. She''d survived to reach this moment.


  Something broke open inside her. Something else took its place.


  Her hand found the sword. When she rose this time, she moved differently—no longer
  fighting her shame, but released from it. The dragon''s strike overextended, and
  she saw the gap in its scales with crystalline clarity.


  She drove her blade home.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  not just victorious but changed—lighter, somehow, as if she''d left something burning
  in the creature''s chest alongside her sword.


  "I did it," she whispered. But the words meant something different now.


  She was no longer the girl who''d hidden. She was the woman who''d faced the truth
  and survived it.'
