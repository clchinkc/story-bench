output: 'The passage Tomás led her through was older than the market above, its walls
  carved with symbols that predated the desert kingdoms. Zara''s lungs burned as they
  ran, the torchlight casting long shadows that seemed to chase them.


  "The Scorpions know this route," she gasped. "They''ll have guards ahead."


  "No," Tomás said, slowing at a junction. "They think this passage collapsed centuries
  ago. We''re safe for now."


  Safe was a word Zara didn''t trust. She pressed her back against the cold stone,
  scanning the darkness for movement while Tomás consulted his notes.


  Then she heard it—the click of a mechanism springing.


  "Stop!" she hissed, but Tomás had already stepped forward. The floor beneath him
  gave way, and he dropped into darkness with a curse. Zara lunged and caught his
  wrist, dangling him over the void. The gap below was absolute, a throat of black
  that seemed to hunger.


  "Hold on!" she ground out, hauling him up. Her muscles screamed, her shoulder protesting.
  She could let go. He was slowing her down, and the Scorpions would be here any moment.
  Her mother was dying, and every second she wasted was a second she couldn''t afford.


  She pulled him up.


  "The trap was meant for intruders," Tomás gasped, sprawled on the stone. "There''s
  a release mechanism somewhere. I need to find it before they follow us."


  Zara knelt beside him, her thief''s instincts kicking in. She examined the trap
  door, noting the wear patterns around its edge. "The mechanism is in the wall, left
  side. See how the stone''s polished different?" She found the hidden catch, disabling
  the trap entirely.


  "You''ve done this before," Tomás said quietly.


  "Breaking and entering? Since I was nine." She didn''t mention that she''d broken
  into the noble quarter to steal food for her siblings. Some pasts belonged buried.


  They pressed deeper into the Approach, where the tunnel narrowed to a single file.
  It was here that Zara''s fear finally caught up with her—not fear of the Scorpions
  or the darkness, but of failure. Of reaching the Library and discovering the cure
  was a myth. Of watching her mother die knowing she hadn''t been fast enough, good
  enough.


  "What if it''s not there?" she whispered. "The knowledge we seek. What if I went
  through all this for nothing?"


  Tomás was silent for a long moment. Then: "My daughter was sick. The wasting disease,
  same as your mother. The healers said there was no cure." His voice cracked. "I
  searched the forbidden archives of twelve cities before I found a reference to the
  Sunken Library. I came here three years ago. I got lost in the Approach for two
  months before I found my way back out."


  Zara stared at him. "You have a daughter?"


  "I did. She died while I was searching." He didn''t look at her. "I failed her.
  I won''t fail another. That''s why I help you. Not for glory or gold. Because someone
  has to reach that library, and I''d rather it be someone who still has something
  worth saving."


  The weight of his confession settled between them. Zara understood then: he wasn''t
  her ally because of kindness. He was her ally because his guilt needed someone else''s
  hope to survive.


  The tunnel ended at a stone door covered in the same glyphs as before. Zara''s fingers
  found the lock mechanism, but it wasn''t like any she''d encountered. It required
  not just skill, but sacrifice—a drop of blood on each of seven pressure points.


  "Do it," Tomás said. "The Ordeal begins when you open this door."


  She sealed the lock with her blood, and the door swung open into darkness so complete
  it felt like falling into nothing.


  The Ordeal took her.


  She fell through cold water that filled her lungs and erased her name. She drowned
  in that black sea, losing everything she was—her thieving hands, her hard heart,
  her fear—until there was nothing left but the desperate, primal need to save her
  mother. She emerged gasping in a cavern of pale green light, clutching the shore
  of some underground lake.


  She was alive. But she was no longer the girl who had entered.


  Her body bore the marks of the Ordeal—scraped and bruised, changed in ways she couldn''t
  name. The fear of failure was still there, but it had transformed into something
  sharper. She wasn''t running from her mother''s death anymore. She was running toward
  her mother''s life.


  Tomás helped her stand. "The Library is beyond this chamber. But Zara—" He hesitated.
  "We''re not the only ones who''ve found the Approach."


  From the darkness behind them came the sound of many footsteps. The Scorpion Guild
  had found a way in after all. And they weren''t alone. Zara could hear another voice,
  cold and commanding, giving orders in a language older than the desert itself.


  She faced Tomás, her knife in hand, her heart steady for the first time in three
  days.


  "Then we finish this together," she said.'
