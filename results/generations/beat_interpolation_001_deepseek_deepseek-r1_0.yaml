output: 'The damp cobblestones glistened under a grey dawn as Elena wandered the village
  outskirts, coat pulled tight against the chill that had settled deeper than the
  night air. She’d walked aimlessly for hours, the image of the pulsing map stubbornly
  replacing every book title she tried to recall. Turning a corner, she nearly collided
  with a narrow, cluttered shopfront. "Marcus’s Curios" proclaimed a peeling sign
  above a window crammed with dusty bottles, peculiar instruments, and a stuffed raven
  with unnervingly bright eyes. The door creaked open seemingly of its own accord.


  Inside, the air smelled of aged paper, herbs, and ozone. A man emerged from behind
  a precarious stack of ledgers, his frame lean but sturdy, eyes sharp beneath bushy
  brows. Lines etched his face like a well-used map. "Lost, are we?" Marcus asked,
  his voice a gravelly rumble. He didn’t wait for an answer, his gaze lingering on
  the troubled set of Elena’s shoulders. "Or perhaps found something you weren’t looking
  for? Maps have a way of appearing, don’t they?"


  Elena flinched. "How did you—?"

  "Grandma Agatha’s ghost flickers near the old oak sometimes. Talks. She’s worried."
  Marcus waved a hand dismissively. "Sit. Tea?" He busied himself without waiting,
  pouring steaming liquid into mismatched cups. "Agatha thinks the map chose you.
  You think it’s a cosmic blunder. Cataloging librarian, not a warrior. Right?"


  Elena nodded miserably, sinking onto a worn stool. "Utterly ordinary."

  Marcus chuckled, a dry sound like rustling leaves. "Ordinary? Tell me, librarian,
  how many times have you pieced together a fragmented history from half-rotted scrolls?
  Deciphered a dead language? Found the single, crucial fact buried in a mountain
  of nonsense? That’s not ordinary. That’s research. And research," he tapped the
  table emphatically, "is the first weapon on any real quest. The Thornwood doesn’t
  care about swinging a sword half as much as it cares about *reading* the signs."


  He pushed a worn leather satchel across the table. "Supplies. Basics. And this,"
  he placed a tarnished brass compass beside it. Its needle spun lazily. "It doesn’t
  point north. It points *towards*. Towards what the forest decides you need to see.
  Or what needs to see you." He met her doubtful eyes. "The map chose you, Elena.
  Maybe because it knows you understand that the most important discoveries start
  not with bravery, but with looking something up. The path is written; you just need
  to read it."


  Elena stared at the compass, its erratic movement strangely compelling. The knot
  of refusal loosened just a fraction. He hadn’t offered to come, hadn’t promised
  magic or strength, just… context. Her context. Books, research, *reading*. Maybe…
  "I suppose," she murmured, her hand hovering over the compass, "knowing *what* you’re
  facing is half the battle." A sliver of reluctant possibility, thin as morning mist,
  began to seep through the cracks in her doubt. She picked up the satchel, its weight
  unfamiliar, but the compass felt strangely right in her palm.'
