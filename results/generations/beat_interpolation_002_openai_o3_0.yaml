output: "Sarah stared at the photograph propped against her coffee mug, the red-marker\
  \ phone number glowing like a countdown. The simplest move—recant, let the D.A.’s\
  \ case crumble, watch Marchetti stroll free—kept Amy alive. Alive but condemned;\
  \ Amy would know her sister had bartered justice for her safety. Sarah tasted bile.\
  \  \n\nShe opened her laptop and drafted an email to the prosecutor: “Regarding\
  \ my forthcoming testimony…” Her fingers hovered. One click and it was done. One\
  \ click and every murder victim in the file became a footnote. She closed the lid\
  \ hard enough to rattle the table.  \n\nAt 5:12 a.m. Detective Marcus Webb let himself\
  \ in with the spare key she’d given him years ago. “Chen, you look like hell.” \
  \ \n\n“Feel worse.” She briefed him, voice flat, laying out times, threats, probabilities.\
  \ Marcus listened, jaw locked.  \n\n“Tell Morrison,” he insisted. “We put Amy into\
  \ protective custody, fast-track the raid on the warehouse. We do it by the book.”\
  \  \n\n“Which book? The one Marchetti owns?” She pulled up the internal affairs\
  \ report on her phone—unnamed officers leaking evidence, subpoenas that vanished\
  \ in transit. “We alert the brass and that warehouse is ashes before the warrant\
  \ prints.”  \n\nMarcus paced, swore under his breath. “Then we go federal—Marshals,\
  \ FBI. Chain of custody stays clean.”  \n\n“Seventy-two hours,” she reminded him.\
  \ “By the time the Bureau clears jurisdiction, Amy’s a body.”  \n\nSilence stretched.\
  \ Outside, a siren dopplered through the dawn; inside, the kitchen clock thudded\
  \ each second away. Marcus finally said, “So what? You fold?”  \n\n“I could,” she\
  \ admitted. “Say I was mistaken, walk into court Monday, lie under oath.” She pictured\
  \ Marchetti’s grin, the widowed Mrs. Alvarez in the front row, the nine-year-old\
  \ who’d watched his father die. She shut her eyes. “I can’t.”  \n\nMarcus’s hand\
  \ settled on her shoulder—steady, loyal, doomed if he stayed involved. In that weight\
  \ she felt the answer: neither surrender nor protocol would save Amy. Something\
  \ outside the badge would.  \n\n“Thank you,” she whispered, decision crystallizing.\
  \ “From here on, keep your distance.”  \n\nHe understood, stepped back, and left\
  \ her alone with a ticking clock and a brand-new war to plan."
