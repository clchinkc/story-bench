output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword trembling in her
  grip. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. "You couldn’t even save your
  brother. Why try?"


  Kira flinched. The memory surged: her brother’s hand slipping from hers as the plague
  took him, his final whisper—*"Don’t let them suffer like me."* She tightened her
  grip. "I won’t fail them again."


  Flame scorched her armor. Claws raked her shield. When the dragon’s tail shattered
  her sword, she dropped to her knees. *"You’re too late,"* the creature hissed. *"Your
  village will burn like he did."* Kira’s vision blurred with blood and tears. The
  ground shook as the dragon loomed. *"Lie down, child. End where you began."*


  She collapsed a second time. The weight of his words crushed her—her brother’s face,
  her helplessness, the shame of surviving. But then… a flicker. Her fingers brushed
  the jagged piece of her blade. *"Don’t let fear be your grave,"* her brother had
  said, voice fading. She rose.


  The dragon swung. She dove, the shattered sword slashing its exposed underbelly.
  Obsidian scales cracked. With a roar, the beast thrashed, its final strike grazing
  her chest as she plunged the shard into its heart.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  trembling. Blood soaked her tunic, her broken arm useless at her side. But her breath
  came steady now. The guilt that had coiled in her chest for years felt lighter,
  unspooled.


  "I did what you couldn’t," she whispered to the corpse. "Not for revenge. To live
  differently."


  She stumbled toward camp, the weight in her hands not the sword, but the truth she’d
  forged in the fire.'
