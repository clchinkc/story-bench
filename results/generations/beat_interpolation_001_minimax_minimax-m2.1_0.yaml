output: 'The bell above the door chimed as Elena pushed into Marcus''s Curiosity Shop,
  her coat still carrying the chill of a sleepless night spent staring at her ceiling.
  The shop smelled of dust, old paper, and something faintly metallic—like blood dried
  into brass.


  She hadn''t planned to come here. Her feet had simply carried her through the gray
  morning light, past the bakery and the blacksmith''s, to this cluttered warren of
  shelves and shadows where Marcus stood behind the counter, polishing a tarnished
  compass.


  "The map finally spoke to you," he said, not looking up. "I wondered when it would
  happen."


  Elena stopped short. "You knew?"


  "Grandmother Mirabel asked me to keep an eye on you. She''s been watching your whole
  life, waiting." He set down the compass and met her gaze. His eyes held the distant
  look of someone who had seen too many sunrises from too many strange places. "Most
  people never get chosen. It''s an honor most never receive."


  "It''s a nightmare." Elena gripped the edge of the counter. "I''m a librarian. I
  catalog things. I make very good tea. That''s all I''m good for."


  Marcus''s lips twitched toward a smile. "A librarian. Someone who finds patterns
  no one else sees. Who researches the obscure and connects the forgotten." He moved
  to a shelf and began selecting items—a small pouch, a bundle of dried herbs, the
  compass he''d been polishing. "You think knowledge is mundane. Out there, knowledge
  is power. Survival."


  He wrapped the items in brown paper and pushed the bundle across the counter.


  "The forest tests intentions, not abilities," he said. "Trust what you know, not
  what you fear you lack."


  Elena''s hand hovered over the package. Somewhere beneath her dread, something small
  and stubborn flickered to life.


  Reluctant. Uncertain. But no longer entirely refusal.'
