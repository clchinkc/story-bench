output: "**ACT I**\n\nKenji Nakamura stood alone in his emptied corner office, watching\
  \ Tokyo's skyline through rain-streaked glass. Twenty years building this company\
  \ from nothing, and now a hostile takeover left him with only a severance package.\
  \ His wife had left when he chose work over family. His daughter Yuki sent birthday\
  \ cards with no return address.\n\nThe letter arrived three days after his termination.\
  \ Yuki's handwriting, shakier than he remembered: \"I'm getting married in Kyoto.\
  \ Mom's gone now, and I don't want to do this alone. Will you walk me down the aisle?\"\
  \ \n\nKenji stared at the paper until the ink blurred. He barely knew her anymore—what\
  \ right did he have to play father now? But his apartment felt like a museum of\
  \ a life half-lived, and there was nothing keeping him in Tokyo.\n\nHe boarded the\
  \ train to Kyoto.\n\n**ACT II**\n\nThe mountain village moved at a different pace.\
  \ Yuki met him at the station, polite but distant. She showed him to a traditional\
  \ inn, introduced him awkwardly to her fiancé, and left him with a schedule of wedding\
  \ preparations.\n\nKenji tried to help—badly. He couldn't fold origami cranes properly\
  \ or arrange flowers. Everything felt foreign until he met Haruki, an elderly bamboo\
  \ craftsman working behind the inn. The old man's weathered hands moved with sure\
  \ precision, weaving stems into elegant baskets.\n\n\"Business?\" Haruki asked,\
  \ noting Kenji's expensive but rumpled suit.\n\n\"Was.\" Kenji watched the careful\
  \ patterns emerge. \"Lost it all.\"\n\nHaruki smiled. \"Good. Now you can find something\
  \ worth keeping.\"\n\nDays passed learning to weave bamboo, sleeping better than\
  \ he had in years. At the village festival, Yuki introduced him to her fiancé's\
  \ family with genuine pride. For the first time, Kenji saw his daughter as she truly\
  \ was—capable, loved, complete without him. The realization should have been devastating,\
  \ but instead felt like relief.\n\nThen his old business rivals found him. A new\
  \ venture, they said. Backing guaranteed. \"Use this wedding time to think it over.\"\
  \n\nWhen Yuki discovered the offer, her face went cold. \"You haven't changed. You're\
  \ still choosing ambition over people.\" She stood in the inn's doorway, hands trembling.\
  \ \"Don't come to my wedding.\"\n\n**ACT III**\n\nKenji sat alone that night, realizing\
  \ she was right. Every choice had led here—alone, unwanted, unable to repair what\
  \ he'd broken. But morning brought clarity. He called the investors and declined.\
  \ Then he found Yuki in Haruki's workshop.\n\n\"I'm not coming to change your mind,\"\
  \ he said quietly. \"I came to apologize. Without conditions.\"\n\nYuki didn't respond,\
  \ but she didn't walk away.\n\nWedding day arrived. Kenji didn't attend the ceremony,\
  \ but waited outside the venue, watching from the garden as his daughter emerged\
  \ radiant in white silk. She found him there afterward.\n\n\"You stayed.\"\n\n\"\
  You're my daughter. I should have stayed years ago.\"\n\nThey didn't embrace, didn't\
  \ reconcile completely, but something began—fragile as new bamboo shoots.\n\n**DENOUEMENT**\n\
  \nSix months later, Kenji opened a small bamboo craft shop in Tokyo. His apartment\
  \ was no longer a museum—plants lined the windowsills, handmade bowls graced his\
  \ table, and Yuki's wedding photo sat on the shelf. He was alone, but no longer\
  \ empty. Sometimes Yuki called. They were learning to build something new—slowly,\
  \ carefully, like weaving bamboo into patterns that would last."
