output: 'Rachel Torres stared at the yellowed photograph from a 1998 unsolved homicide,
  ignoring the steam rising from her black coffee. A low-thrumming jazz record provided
  the only soundtrack to her Queens apartment, save for the rhythmic scratching of
  Sherlock against the leg of her desk. She reached down to scratch the tabby’s ears—ears
  she had first seen poking out from beneath a blood-stained sofa two years ago. Most
  detectives would have left the stray for animal control, but Rachel had carried
  him out alongside the evidence bags.


  By 8:00 AM on that Tuesday morning in October, the Riverside Precinct hummed with
  its usual friction. Rachel navigated the maze of desks toward her own, where her
  weathered badge sat beside a stack of active files. Detective James Oyelaran didn''t
  look up from his monitor, but he wordlessly slid a fresh printout of the morning’s
  property crime reports into her reach.


  "The Miller case again, Rachel?" James asked, his voice carrying the easy weight
  of their three-year partnership. "You''re going to wear the ink off those pages."


  "The witness statement from ''98 doesn''t square with the new forensics," she replied,
  her eyes narrowing as she scanned the lines.


  James offered a silent, respectful nod. He knew better than to challenge her instincts;
  they were the reason their clearance rate remained the highest in the precinct,
  even as the neighborhood shifted between luxury high-rises and struggling storefronts.
  He watched her settle into the familiar rhythm of the hunt, her focus absolute.


  The crisp autumn air rattled the precinct’s heavy windows, carrying the scent of
  rain and exhaust. It was a morning defined by the steady, comfortable baseline of
  their routine—a world of cold files and hot coffee—until the sudden, sharp ring
  of the precinct captain’s phone shattered the silence.'
