  The segment effectively executes the Dark Night of the Soul beat. It clearly follows
  the "All Is Lost" moment (the gallery''s closure), placing Maya in isolation in
  her dark apartment. There is profound despair and reflection on her failure to uphold
  her mother''s legacy, emphasizing genuine emotional depth beyond mere sadness. No
  solutions are presented; instead, Maya is shown in a state of complete helplessness
  and wallowing. The "whiff of death" element is subtly present through the reflection
  on her deceased mother''s promise, the painting of a woman walking towards an "unseen
  horizon," and Maya''s feeling that "time had stopped," signifying the death of her
  current purpose and identity. The internal, vulnerable tone is consistent with the
  beat''s requirements.'
