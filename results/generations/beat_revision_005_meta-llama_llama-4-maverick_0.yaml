output: 'Maya sat in the dark, surrounded by the remnants of her mother''s legacy.
  The city outside was a distant hum, a reminder of all that had been lost. She was
  alone, just as she had feared. The weight of her failure crushed her, making it
  hard to breathe.


  In the darkness, she felt the presence of her mother''s paintings, the stories she
  had told, and the laughter they had shared. The gallery, once a symbol of her mother''s
  passion and creativity, was now nothing more than a memory. The pain of that loss
  was a palpable thing, a stone that pressed against her chest.


  She had promised to keep the gallery alive, to preserve the art and the memories.
  But it was too late now. The investors had walked away, the crowdfunding had failed,
  and she was left with nothing but the echoes of her mother''s voice. The city outside
  was moving on, but she was stuck, trapped in the wreckage of her own dreams.


  The darkness was a comfort, a reminder that she was not alone in her grief. The
  shadows seemed to wrap around her, holding her in their silence. And in that silence,
  she felt the weight of her failure, the sting of her loss.


  As she sat there, the darkness began to seep into her bones, a cold, hard truth
  that she couldn''t escape. The gallery was gone, and she was left to pick up the
  pieces. The thought was suffocating, but it was also a reminder that she had made
  it through harder times before. The pain would not last forever, but for now, it
  was enough to simply be.'
