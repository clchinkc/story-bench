output: 'The Buckingham Hotel''s lobby thrummed with residual grief—blue wisps of
  sorrow clung to the water-damaged wallpaper like cobwebs. Dante kept his hands in
  his pockets, three years clean and still fighting the phantom itch for a different
  kind of numbness. He’d come searching for Rosa’s signature, the particular violet
  shimmer she’d left on everything she touched.


  A voice cut through the murk. “You’re the junkie she took pity on.”


  Dante turned. The Resonant blocking his path was all sharp edges—lean, angular,
  with eyes that catalogued weaknesses. His name was Kael, and his skepticism hung
  around him in jagged red lines.


  “I’m the one who can find her killer,” Dante said quietly.


  Kael’s laugh was bitter. “Once an addict, always a liability. Prove it.”


  The test came swift and brutal. A Resonant stumbled through the lobby doors, clutching
  his chest. Terror poured off him in viscous black tendrils. “He’s here,” the man
  gasped. “The Hollow.”


  Dante dropped to one knee, fingers brushing the floor. He reached for his gift,
  letting the emotional residue flood his senses. The black tendrils had a direction,
  a source—but more importantly, they had a gap. A perfect circle of untouched floor
  where emotion simply… stopped.


  “Someone’s suppressing the trail,” Dante said, pointing. “Right there. That’s not
  empty—that’s scrubbed.”


  Kael’s suspicion flickered. Only a traitor could mask their signature so completely.
  The revelation hung between them.


  Then the trap sprung. The Hollow’s minions—Resonants whose abilities had been drained—burst
  from the stairwell. Dante moved without thinking, snatching his modified spray cans
  from his bag. He tagged one attacker with a burst of crimson residue—Rosa’s signature,
  which he’d preserved. The man froze, overwhelmed by borrowed grief.


  Kael watched the spray can in Dante’s hand. “What is that?”


  "My past," Dante said. "It''s all I have left."


  In Kael’s safehouse—a condemned loft in Pilsen—Dante spread the spray cans across
  a scarred table. Each one contained a different emotional signature, captured and
  preserved. His addiction had been to heroin; his recovery was this—bottling feelings
  instead of numbing them.


  “The Hollow doesn’t just drain abilities,” Kael said, studying the cans. “He feeds
  on specific emotions. Guilt is his favorite vintage.”


  Dante’s fingers trembled on a can labeled with his sister’s name. Maya. Three years
  dead from an overdose in this very hotel’s sub-basement. He’d been high that night,
  useless. The guilt wasn’t a residue—it was his bones, his blood.


  “The Buckingham’s sub-basement,” Kael continued. “That’s where Rosa died. It’s where
  Maya died. He’s drawing you there, Dante. Your guilt is a lighthouse.”


  Dante understood then. Confrontation meant facing not the Hollow, but himself. The
  spray cans felt suddenly heavy.


  “I could use again,” Dante whispered. “Numb this. Walk away.”


  Kael’s gaze was steady. “Or you could use what you’ve built. Those cans—they’re
  not your past. They’re your apprenticeship.”


  They prepared. Kael adjusted a null-field generator, a device that would temporarily
  strip the Hollow’s masking ability. Dante tested his sister’s spray, the nozzle
  hissing out a fine mist of memory. He practiced channeling the guilt without drowning.


  The threshold was a rusted service door in the Buckingham’s alley. Behind it, the
  descent into the sub-basement where two women he’d loved had died. Dante’s knuckles
  were white on the spray cans.


  “One more thing,” Kael said, pressing a small vial into Dante’s palm. “Pure emotional
  void. If the Hollow gets inside your head—drink it. It’ll blank everything. Including
  your guilt.”


  Dante pocketed the vial, the promise of oblivion tempting as any needle.


  The sub-basement was a cathedral of rot. Water dripped from pipes, each drop leaving
  a ripple of despair. Dante saw Rosa’s violet signature everywhere, smeared and violated.
  And Maya’s softer pink, barely a whisper.


  The Hollow stepped from the shadows, wearing a face Dante knew—the dealer who’d
  sold Maya her final dose.


  “You kept her signature all this time,” the Hollow murmured. “Delicious.”


  He unleashed Dante’s guilt. It hit like a wave—every moment of that night, amplified,
  saturated with color until Dante couldn’t breathe. Symbolic death. He was the junkie
  again, the failure, the brother who let his sister die. The vial in his pocket burned
  with promised escape.


  Kael activated the null-field. It backfired, energy ricocheting off the Hollow’s
  corrupted abilities. Kael collapsed, convulsing.


  All seemed lost. The guilt would consume him. The Hollow would win. Dante’s fingers
  found the vial—


  No.


  He grabbed Maya’s spray can instead. Not to erase, but to externalize. He painted
  his guilt across the walls in sweeping arcs, tagging the pipes, the floor, the air
  itself. The Hollow laughed, feeding—until he choked.


  Too much. Dante’s guilt was overwhelming, but it was also pure. Unfiltered. Real.
  The Hollow had never fed on someone who carried their pain consciously.


  Dante advanced, spraying as he walked, covering the killer in his sister’s signature.
  The Hollow screamed as the guilt became visible to every Resonant in the city—a
  beacon, a mark. Not erased, but shared. Understood.


  The transformation wasn’t absolution. It was acceptance. He would always carry Maya.
  That was the point.


  He dropped the can. It rolled to Kael’s feet.


  Kael looked at the tag on the wall—a perfect circle of pink residue, the gap where
  the Hollow had scrubbed his own presence. The Chekhov’s Gun. Dante had filled it
  with truth. '
