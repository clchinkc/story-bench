output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly." Sophie scrolled through her phone,
  checking the work emails that had piled up while she was away. Three messages from
  Linda. The Pearson account flagged twice. She felt the familiar spike of panic rising—then
  paused.


  She set the phone face-down on her lap.


  "Everything okay?" her mother asked.


  "Work emergencies. The usual." Sophie looked out at the evening haze. "But Linda
  survived without me for two weeks. She''ll survive one more night."


  Her mother glanced over, surprised.


  "I''ll call her first thing tomorrow," Sophie continued. "She can wait six hours.
  It''s not actually life or death, even though it feels that way." She said it calmly,
  factually—like she was noticing a thought rather than living it.


  They drove in silence for a while. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through
  the evening haze. Sophie''s apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought
  her morning latte. Everything exactly as she''d left it. But she was seeing it differently
  now—not as a to-do list or a series of obligations, but as part of a life she actually
  wanted to live.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, and meant it. Not because the chaos had stopped.
  But because she''d learned in those quiet temples that she didn''t have to let the
  chaos define her anymore.'
