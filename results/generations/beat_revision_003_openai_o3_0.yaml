output: "Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected\
  \ her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with\
  \ the car.  \n\n\"How was Thailand?\" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.\
  \  \n\n\"Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos.\"  \n\n\"And\
  \ the meditation retreat?\"  \n\n\"It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly.\"\
  \ Sophie unlocked her phone, and the screen filled with red-flag icons. Three emergencies.\
  \ Linda needs me to call her tonight. She inhaled, then let the breath leave as\
  \ slowly as the monks had taught her. The device buzzed again. This time she locked\
  \ the screen and placed the phone face-down on her lap. \"I'll deal with Pearson\
  \ first thing tomorrow,\" she said. \"Right now I want to be present.\"  \n\nHer\
  \ mother arched an eyebrow. \"That's new.\"  \n\n\"Yeah,\" Sophie said with a small\
  \ smile, \"so am I.\"  \n\nThey drove in companionable silence. The familiar Chicago\
  \ skyline appeared through the evening haze—her apartment building, the coffee shop\
  \ where she bought her morning latte—everything exactly as she'd left it, yet subtly\
  \ rearranged by what she now noticed in it: the surprising space between moments.\
  \  \n\n\"It's good to be home,\" she said, feeling the words settle like warm tea\
  \ instead of a race cue. Her phone vibrated again; she flipped it to airplane mode\
  \ and slid it into her backpack.  \n\nLife went on—at a pace she finally chose."
