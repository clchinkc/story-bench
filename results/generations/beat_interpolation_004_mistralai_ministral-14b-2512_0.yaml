output: 'Thomas stepped forward, his tie knotted too tight, his pulse hammering in
  his throat. The courtroom air was thick with the scent of old wood and anticipation.
  "Dr. Okonkwo," he began, voice steady despite the storm inside him, "you were the
  architect of Meridian’s research protocols. You signed off on the trials that led
  to seventeen deaths. Do you deny that?"


  Her fingers twitched against the armrests. "No, I don’t deny it," she said, but
  her voice wavered. The defense attorney leaned forward, his smile sharp. "Then why
  should this jury believe you now, after years of silence?"


  Thomas didn’t flinch. He pulled the first document from his folder—a memo, stamped
  *CONFIDENTIAL*, buried in Meridian’s internal files. "Because you know the truth,
  Doctor. You saw the data. You *buried* it." He slid it across the table. "Tell us
  why."


  Her breath hitched. For a moment, her eyes darted to the defense table, where the
  CEO’s smirk had vanished, replaced by something colder. Then she looked at Thomas,
  at the stack of files in his hand—files she’d helped him assemble, files that could
  destroy her. "They offered my husband a chance," she whispered. "For our daughter.
  Stage-four leukemia. They said if I testified, she’d get the treatment."


  The courtroom gasped. Thomas’s stomach twisted, but he didn’t look away. "And if
  you didn’t testify?"


  Her hands clenched. "She dies."


  Silence. Then, from the gallery, a child’s cough—weak, wet. Thomas’s father’s jaw
  tightened, but he said nothing.


  Thomas exhaled, slow and deliberate. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled
  out a folded piece of paper. "Dr. Okonkwo," he said, voice low, "I’ve arranged for
  an independent trial at St. Agnes. Experimental treatment. Not Meridian’s. *Real*
  research. Your daughter qualifies."


  Her fingers trembled. "You—you can’t promise that."


  "I can promise you this," he said, stepping closer to the witness stand. "Meridian
  will fight this verdict tooth and nail. They’ll drag this out for years. Your daughter
  won’t have years." He leaned in, just slightly. "But you *will* have the truth.
  And if you walk away from that stand now, you’ll live with it. Every day. For the
  rest of your life."


  Her breath came fast. The defense attorney opened his mouth—then closed it. The
  judge’s gavel hovered, unstruck.


  Dr. Okonkwo’s voice was barely audible. "I saw the data. I lied about it." A tear
  slipped down her cheek. "I lied because I was scared. But I won’t lie anymore."


  The courtroom erupted—not in cheers, but in ragged breaths, in the sound of a jury
  leaning forward as one. Thomas didn’t smile. He just nodded, once, and turned to
  the defense. "No further questions, Your Honor."


  The gavel fell. The truth had won. But the cost was written in the hollows of Dr.
  Okonkwo’s eyes.'
