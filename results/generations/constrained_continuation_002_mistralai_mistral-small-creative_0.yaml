output: 'The viral moment came at 3:17 PM when a food blogger’s post—*"What’s this
  disaster parked on Cesar Chavez?"*—got picked up by a meme account with 5 million
  followers. By 3:30, a line snaked around the block. By 4:00, Priya and Dev were
  moving like a well-oiled machine, her flipping paneer patties while he assembled
  tacos, their hands brushing as they passed plates through the window. The truck’s
  pink exterior, once a liability, now glowed under the afternoon sun like a beacon.


  "Order up!" Dev called, sliding a tray of smoky, spiced tacos toward a customer.
  "Next!"


  Priya wiped sweat from her brow, grinning. "Told you the name would work. *Pinky’s
  Paneer BBQ*—it’s got *personality*."


  Dev shot her a look. "It’s got *something*, alright." But he was laughing, his usual
  skepticism replaced by the kind of adrenaline-fueled energy that came from chaos
  turning into triumph.


  Then the rival truck rolled in.


  A sleek, silver Airstream with the words *"Smoke & Spice"* painted in bold script
  parked directly across the lot. The line for Pinky’s faltered as heads turned. A
  tall man in a crisp white apron stepped out, his dark beard neatly trimmed, his
  expression unreadable as he surveyed the competition.


  Priya’s stomach dropped. "That’s Mateo Rivera. He won last year’s championship *and*
  the one before that."


  Dev groaned. "Of course he did. And of course he’s here *now*."


  Mateo didn’t approach. He didn’t need to. His presence alone was a challenge. Within
  minutes, his truck’s line rivaled theirs, the air thick with the scent of his famous
  brisket.


  Priya clenched her fists. "We’re not losing to some guy who probably doesn’t even
  *like* paneer."


  Dev exhaled sharply. "Priya, we’ve been open six hours. We’re running out of meat."


  She didn’t hesitate. "Then we improvise." She grabbed her phone, dialing the one
  person who could help—her uncle’s butcher shop. "Uncle Raj, we need *everything*
  you’ve got. And fast."


  By 5:30, they were back in the game. Priya had whipped up a last-minute batch of
  spicy paneer *kebabs* to stretch their supplies, while Dev charmed the crowd with
  his dry humor, turning the food truck into a spectacle. The line never shortened,
  but neither did theirs.


  Then came the moment that sealed it—a little girl, no older than eight, took one
  bite of Priya’s fusion taco and declared, *"This is the best thing I’ve ever eaten!"*
  Her mother, a local influencer, snapped a photo and posted it with the caption:
  *"Game changer. @PinkysPaneerBBQ—where have you been all my life?"*


  The likes poured in. The shares exploded. By sunset, their truck was trending.


  Dev leaned against the counter, wiping his hands on his apron. "We did it."


  Priya high-fived him, her energy electric. "We *so* did it."


  But as the crowd cheered and the orders kept coming, Mateo Rivera finally made his
  move. He crossed the lot, stopping just short of their window. "Impressive," he
  said, his voice low. "But the championship isn’t won in a day."


  Priya met his gaze. "Neither is it lost in one."


  Mateo smirked. "We’ll see." Then he turned and walked back to his truck, leaving
  behind a silence that felt like a warning.


  Dev exhaled. "Well. That was ominous."


  Priya watched Mateo’s retreating back, her mind racing. The viral moment had saved
  them—for now. But the real battle was just beginning. And if Mateo Rivera was anything
  like his reputation, he didn’t play fair.


  She turned to Dev, her voice steady. "We need a plan."


  He nodded. "Yeah. We do."


  The Midpoint had arrived. The dream was alive. But the stakes? They’d just gotten
  a whole lot higher.'
