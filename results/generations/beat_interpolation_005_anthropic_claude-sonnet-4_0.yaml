output: 'Maya found him in the kitchen at two in the morning, sitting at the marble
  island with his head in his hands. The great Alejandro Vega, reduced to this—shoulders
  shaking with silent sobs.


  She should have retreated. Given him privacy. Instead, she moved quietly to the
  stove.


  "What are you doing?" His voice was raw.


  "Making tea." She reached for the kettle. "And tortilla española. My grandmother''s
  recipe."


  "I''m not hungry."


  "It''s not about being hungry." She cracked eggs into a bowl, the familiar rhythm
  steadying her hands. "Today''s the anniversary, isn''t it? The accident."


  His sharp intake of breath told her she''d guessed right. Three years ago, the career-ending
  injury that had shattered more than just his knee.


  "The papers got it wrong," he said after a long silence. "They said I was driving
  too fast, showing off. But there was a child. A little girl who ran into the street
  chasing her ball." His voice cracked. "I swerved to miss her."


  Maya''s hands stilled on the whisk. "You saved her life."


  "And ended mine."


  She turned to face him fully. "You saved a child''s life, Alejandro. Your career
  ending doesn''t make that meaningless."


  "Doesn''t it? I had nothing else. Football was everything. Without it..." He gestured
  helplessly at the empty mansion around them.


  Maya moved closer, potato and onion sizzling in the pan behind her. "My grandmother
  always said food tells the truth. When someone cooks for you with love, really cooks,
  you taste hope along with the salt."


  She reached out, barely brushing his knuckles with her fingertips. "Let me cook
  for you. Really cook. Not because you''re paying me, but because..." She took a
  breath, crossing a line she couldn''t uncross. "Because you matter to me."


  His eyes met hers, vulnerable and uncertain. "Maya..."


  "Stay with me while I finish this. Please."


  He nodded, and something shifted between them—professional walls crumbling, replaced
  by something infinitely more dangerous and real.


  When she placed the perfect golden tortilla before him, cut into careful wedges,
  she knew she was no longer here just for her grandmother''s restaurant. She was
  here for him.


  And that changed everything.'
