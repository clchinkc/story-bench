  This segment properly executes the "Dark Night of the Soul" beat. It follows the
  All Is Lost moment (gallery closure), shows Maya completely alone in a dark apartment,
  contains genuine despair and self-reflection (failing the promise, failing her mother,
  failing herself), offers no solutions (she explicitly acknowledges there''s nothing
  left to do), and includes the mortality element through the mother''s death, hospice
  memory, and last painting. The 317-word count falls within the 200-350 requirement,
  and all required elements are preserved.'
