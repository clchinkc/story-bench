output: 'Thomas rose from the prosecution table, every eye in the courtroom tracking
  his movement. The silence was a physical pressure, his father''s gaze burning into
  his back. He approached the witness stand where Dr. Okonkwo sat with her hands clasped
  so tightly her knuckles showed white.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," Thomas began, his voice carrying despite the tremor beneath it, "can
  you identify this document?"


  She took it with shaking fingers. "It''s the Phase Two trial report."


  "And what does it indicate about Meridian''s drug?"


  She opened her mouth. Closed it. Her eyes flicked to the defense table, where Meridian''s
  CEO sat with that terrible, certain smile. Thomas saw the calculation forming—the
  seventeen dead versus one living daughter. He saw the choice she was about to make.


  "Dr. Okonkwo?" Thomas prompted softly.


  "I—" Her voice cracked. "I''m not certain I recall—"


  The defense attorney leaned back, his posture screaming victory. Thomas''s chest
  tightened. This was the collapse. The moment everything he''d built would crumble.


  He couldn''t let it.


  Thomas stepped closer, abandoning his prepared questions, his legal strategy, everything
  but the raw truth. "Your Honor, a foundational question before we proceed."


  The judge raised an eyebrow but nodded.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," Thomas said, his voice cutting through the silence, "has anyone from
  Meridian made representations about your daughter''s treatment contingent on your
  testimony?"


  The courtroom erupted. The defense attorney shot up, shouting objection. But Thomas
  saw Dr. Okonkwo''s face—the shock, the dawning hope. He pressed on, speaking over
  the chaos.


  "Because arrangements were secured at St. Catherine''s Hospital this morning. An
  independent trial. No strings. Your daughter''s approved."


  The words hung in the air. The CEO''s smile vanished. Dr. Okonkwo''s lips parted,
  tears streaming down her face.


  Thomas held up another document. "Now. What does this internal email chain reveal
  about Meridian''s knowledge of cardiac risks?"


  She stared at him for a long moment. Then her shoulders straightened. Her voice
  came clear and unwavering. "It proves Meridian knew about the seventeen deaths three
  months before notifying the FDA. They buried the reports. I have the originals."


  The defense table erupted in frantic whispers. The gallery gasped. But Thomas saw
  only his father at the back, inclining his head a fraction—an acknowledgment of
  a line crossed, a principle upheld.


  The truth, finally, had its witness.'
