output: 'Dante pushed through the rotting velvet ropes of the Buckingham Hotel lobby,
  the air thick with the smell of wet copper and old dust. The grand chandeliers were
  skeletons of iron, swaying in a breeze that didn''t exist. A girl crouched behind
  the concierge desk—Jax, a Resonant shielder known for her cynicism. She leveled
  a sawed-off shotgun at his chest, her eyes darting to the tremor in his hands.


  "You reek of withdrawal, Dante," she spat, keeping the bead steady. "I know you''re
  chasing the dragon to drown the sight. You''re a liability."


  "I''m three years clean, Jax. The shakes are from the static in this room." Dante
  raised his hands slowly, his gaze fixed on the floorboards beneath her. They were
  groaning, shimmering with a jagged, red haze—a trap left by the killer. "Move!"
  Dante shouted, lunging forward. He grabbed Jax by the collar, dragging her behind
  a marble pillar just as the floor dissolved into a vortex of screaming energy.


  Dante stared at the residue, his breath hitching. It wasn''t just a trap; it was
  a signature. He saw a shadow detach itself from the wall behind them—Silas, a Resonant
  they had trusted, his eyes hollowed out by the killer''s touch. "He wants you broken,"
  Silas whispered before fading into the dark. Dante looked at Jax, her fear now replaced
  by a grudging respect. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a battered can
  of chrome spray paint. "Rosa gave me this," Dante said, tossing it to her. "It’s
  loaded with charged silica. It freezes emotional residue. If the killer tries to
  drain us, paint him. It’s the only thing that sticks."


  They ascended the grand staircase, the air growing colder, heavier with every step.
  The hotel wasn''t just a building; it was a graveyard of feelings. Jax handed him
  a pair of tinted goggles to filter the glare of the accumulated pain. "We need to
  be precise," she said. "He''s siphoning the grid."


  Dante paused on the fourth-floor landing. To his left, a faint, golden shimmer pulsed
  against the peeling wallpaper—the ghost of a laugh he hadn''t heard in years. His
  sister, Elena. The residue coiled around his ankles like heavy chains, whispering
  of needles and silence.


  "She’s not here, Dante," Jax said softly, checking the mechanism of her pistol.
  "That’s just the memory. The killer is in the penthouse."


  "I know," Dante rasped, his throat tight. "But if I go up there, I have to look
  at why she died. I have to accept that I was high in the next room when she needed
  me." He gripped the railing until his knuckles turned white. The guilt was a physical
  weight, dragging him down the steps, tempting him to just let go and slide back
  into the numbness of addiction.


  "If you stay here, you die," Jax said, her voice hardening. "Rosa didn''t teach
  you to survive so you could quit at the door. Use the pain. Don''t let it use you."


  Dante took a shuddering breath, centering himself like he did in the meetings. He
  straightened, pushing the golden chains away. "Let''s go." They stepped across the
  threshold of the penthouse corridor, the darkness absolute, save for the sickly
  purple glow leaking from under the suite door.


  The killer, Kael, stood over a drained victim in the center of the room. He wore
  a suit that rippled with stolen colors, the emotions of his victims writhing against
  the fabric. He turned, his face a mask of terrifying calm. "Dante. You brought the
  guilt I needed. It makes the vintage sweet."


  He lunged, his aura expanding like a suffocating fog. It slammed into Dante, not
  physically, but spiritually. Dante collapsed, gasping. He was back in that apartment,
  the needle in his arm, the silence next door screaming. He was dying, the guilt
  crushing his chest. *You failed her. You failed Rosa. You are nothing.*


  Jax fired, but the bullets stopped in mid-air, caught in Kael’s telekinetic grip.
  "It''s over," Kael smiled, raising a hand to finish them.


  Dante looked up, tears streaming, clarity cutting through the haze. He saw the truth.
  He couldn''t save Elena. But he wasn''t that junkie anymore. "Jax," he wheezed,
  pointing at the can in her hand. "The ceiling! The conduit!"


  Jax understood. She sprayed the chrome paint directly onto the crystal chandelier
  above Kael. The silica reacted instantly, crystallizing the emotional energy Kael
  was trying to wield. The purple glow shattered. Kael screamed as the feedback loop
  tore through his connection to the ether. He fell, hollow and broken.


  Dante crawled to his feet. He didn''t feel high on the victory; he just felt clean.
  The golden chains were gone, replaced by the quiet, steady gray of sobriety.'
