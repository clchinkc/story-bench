output: 'The medical bay smelled wrong—sterile and sweet, like someone had scrubbed
  it obsessively then abandoned the effort. Yuki''s scanner detected elevated trace
  elements in the air: cesium, strontium, heavy isotopes that didn''t belong in standard
  station atmosphere. Her hands tightened on the device. Radiation exposure? But the
  dosimeters showed nothing.


  In the lab section of the bay, she found the personal effects—floating, suspended
  in mid-air. A wedding ring. A child''s drawing. A half-consumed cup of coffee, its
  surface undisturbed despite days of zero-g drift. It was as if time had frozen at
  the molecular level, preserving the moment of... what? Transformation. The word
  crystallized in her mind, though she had no logical justification for it yet.


  Movement caught her eye—a shimmer near the viewport, like heat rising from summer
  asphalt. Yuki spun, scanner raised. "Identify yourself."


  The shimmer took quasi-form, humanoid and terrifying. She heard breathing, or something
  approximating it, layered on top of itself as if multiple people were exhaling in
  unison. The air temperature fluctuated wildly. Her instrumentation went haywire,
  readings spiking then flattering into nonsense.


  She ran.


  The command center was where Commander Reyes would have been during the crisis.
  Files lay scattered across the floor, fallen or thrown—Yuki couldn''t determine
  which. One document caught her eye: "Dimensional Bridge Hypothesis." Equations she
  recognized from Reyes''s published work on quantum state manipulation. They''d been
  attempting something radical, something untested.


  The pursuing shimmer filled the doorway. Yuki''s heart hammered against her ribs.
  She backed deeper into the room, searching desperately for something, anything.
  Her foot caught a data tablet. The screen flickered to life with residual charge,
  displaying a half-written log entry: "...transformation irreversible but consciousness
  intact... can perceive normal space but cannot interact... need someone to complete
  the research..."


  Understanding bloomed cold in her chest. They weren''t attacking. They were desperate—trying
  to reach her, trying to communicate through their altered state. The transformed
  crew members weren''t enemies. They were prisoners in their own evolution.


  Yuki lowered her scanner. The shimmers clustered closer, less threatening now that
  she recognized their intention. They were showing her the way—guiding her toward
  Lab Seven, toward the data core, toward the only thing that could justify their
  sacrifice.'
