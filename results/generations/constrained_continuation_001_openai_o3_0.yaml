output: 'Torchlight dwindled as Tomás dragged Zara through a fissure no wider than
  a market stall. The air cooled, trading spice-thick odors for the mineral bite of
  untouched stone. Behind them echoed the Guild’s whistles—three notes, a hunter’s
  cadence.


  “Are you sure?” she hissed.


  “Sure enough,” he answered, pushing onward until the tunnel blossomed into a vaulted
  antechamber layered in dust. An obsidian door waited, ribs of copper interlaced
  like a spiderweb. At its center sat a slot shaped exactly like the map she carried.


  “The Approach,” Tomás whispered. “Beyond this is the throat of the Library.”


  Bootsteps boomed from the passage they’d left. Zara could sprint back through the
  maze; her street routes were etched into muscle memory. Tomás, limping from an old
  academic life spent at desks rather than rooftop ledges, would be caught. Survival
  tugged at her like a familiar friend.


  A choice: leave him, reach the Library alone, maybe in time to save Mother. Or stay,
  risk capture, yet honor the man who’d guided her through darkness.


  Zara forced her breath steady, recalling Mother’s voice: Nothing worth having is
  taken alone. She sliced free the strings securing the map and slammed it into the
  slot. Copper ribs recoiled; the obsidian door sighed open. “Move,” she ordered,
  grabbing Tomás’s arm. They plunged inside moments before scorpion-marked silhouettes
  flooded the antechamber.


  The door resealed, extinguishing all sound. Phosphorescent lichen revealed a corridor
  tiled with alternating sun and scorpion sigils. Zara crouched, studying hairline
  seams. Classic pressure plates. A wrong step would announce their presence to every
  Guild scout already tunneling nearby.


  “Stay behind me,” she said. Fingers brushed each tile, feeling for the faint warmth
  of springs under scorpion icons. She advanced only on the suns, sometimes leaping
  the space of two tiles when patterns shifted. Midway through, a sun tile wobbled—misdirection.
  She jammed her knife’s hilt under its edge, redistributing her weight until she
  could pivot to safe ground. When they reached the far archway, Tomás exhaled like
  a bellows emptied.


  “You never told me you could read mechanical language,” he said.


  “You never asked.” She eyed him. “What else haven’t you told me?”


  Guilt flickered across his scholar’s calm. “You think I volunteered out of kindness.
  Truth is, the Library houses the Codex of Redactions. My dissertation was burned
  for quoting it. If I retrieve the original pages, the Academy must reinstate me.”
  He glanced away. “I want your cure found, Zara, I do. But I also want my name back.”


  His confession spiked her chest with betrayal, then cooled into understanding. Everyone
  in Vel’kara wore masks; his simply cracked sooner than most.


  They reached a spiral staircase descending into black. Each step deepened, then
  liquefied underfoot—quick-sandstone engineered to sense weight. The pair slipped,
  tumbling into a vast pit. Sand swallowed them, choking breath and light. Zara’s
  fear wasn’t of dying; it was of failing, of returning home empty-handed to the raspy
  cough that hollowed her mother’s nights. In that suffocating dark she felt the weight
  of all her stolen trinkets—habits of taking instead of giving—clamp around her lungs.


  She kicked hard, swimming upward through grit. When her head broke the surface,
  she emerged into a chamber lit by skylight shafts from the desert above. Sand cascaded
  off her like a second skin shed. Beside her, Tomás coughed, alive. Symbolic death,
  whispered a corner of her mind. Rebirth buys passage.


  Ahead loomed twin statues of jackals guarding a stone gate now ajar, the path beyond
  choked with scroll tubes and toppled shelves—a glimpse of the Sunken Library’s outermost
  stacks. Yet the chamber’s silence was wrong. A soft ticking rose, emanating from
  brass canisters lining the walls.


  Tomás paled. “Volatility charges. The Guild means to bury the Library for good.”


  Zara’s heartbeat thundered, but it no longer felt like panic. She had crossed a
  threshold where retreat wasn’t an option; the map, the tiles, the sand pit had stripped
  her to purpose. She looked at the scholar, saw not just an ally but a man whose
  redemption was tied to hers.


  “Then we disarm them,” she said, voice steady. Knife in one hand, knowledge in the
  other, she stepped toward the first ticking cylinder, knowing the true test had
  only just begun.'
