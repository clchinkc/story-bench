output: 'By the third week, Maya could predict Alejandro’s moods by what came back
  untouched. The sea bass she’d coaxed into crisp-skinned perfection, the almond cake
  still warm from the oven—returned as if the plates had never left the tray.


  That night she abandoned elegance and made caldo the way her grandmother did when
  money was thin: garlic blistered in olive oil, stale bread revived, paprika darkening
  the pot to a smoky rust. It was humble enough to feel like defiance in a kitchen
  built for magazine spreads.


  She was tasting for salt when she felt him before she saw him, a quiet weight in
  the doorway.


  “You’re awake,” she said, because it was safer than asking why he never slept.


  Alejandro’s hair was mussed, his bare feet silent on the tile. In the dim under-cabinet
  light, he looked younger, almost ordinary. “It smells like… home,” he murmured,
  then stopped, as if the word had slipped out without permission.


  Maya held out a spoon. “Try it.”


  His fingers closed around the handle, and for a moment his knuckles whitened. He
  lifted the broth, swallowed, and his face didn’t change the way faces changed when
  food pleased them. No flare of surprise, no softening at the eyes—only a tightness
  at the corners of his mouth.


  “You don’t like it,” she said, already reaching for the salt.


  “It’s not that.” He set the spoon down carefully, like a fragile thing. “I can’t.”
  His gaze flicked to the tiled floor. “I haven’t been able to, for years.”


  The words landed heavy, rearranging everything she’d assumed. “Taste?” she asked,
  quietly.


  He gave a single nod. “After the concussion. Surgery. They said it might return.”
  His laugh was brief and hollow. “Chefs think I’m cruel. Truth is, I’m… embarrassed.
  Food is supposed to be pleasure. For me it’s texture and memory I can’t touch.”


  Maya’s chest tightened with an unexpected ache. She stepped closer, not to cross
  a line, but to make a different one. “Then let’s cook for what you can feel,” she
  said. “Heat. Acid. Crunch. The way a bite can wake you up even without flavor.”


  He looked up, and there was something raw in his expression, as if she’d named a
  wound he’d been pretending wasn’t there.


  She ladled caldo into a bowl, added a squeeze of lemon, a scatter of fried bread,
  a drizzle of oil so peppery it caught at the throat. “Eyes closed,” she instructed,
  and when he obeyed, he trusted her enough to do it.


  He took a mouthful. This time his shoulders eased, just a fraction, and his breath
  left him like surrender. “My mother,” he said, voice rough. “She used to make it
  when I came in from training. Before everything became… cameras.”


  Maya found herself smiling, small and startled. “Tell me,” she said.


  They carried their bowls to the balcony for air, the sea a dark sheet beyond the
  terrace. Alejandro leaned on the rail beside her, close enough that she could feel
  his warmth without touching. For the first time, the silence between them didn’t
  feel like a door.


  When he spoke again, it was almost a question. “Why are you still here, Maya?”


  She could have said the number on the contract, the debts waiting at home. Instead
  she heard herself answer, honest in a way that scared her. “Because you’re not a
  headline,” she said. “And because I think you’ve been eating alone for too long.”


  His gaze held hers, unguarded and wary, and something inside her clicked into place—an
  understanding that six months was no longer the point. “I’ll stay,” she added, before
  he could retreat behind business. “Not because I have to. Because I want to.”'
