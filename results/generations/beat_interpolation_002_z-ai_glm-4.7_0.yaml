output: 'Sarah paced the length of her living room, the photograph of Amy burning
  a hole in her pocket. The logical choice was sickeningly clear: recant. One lie
  on the stand, Amy comes home, and Marchetti walks. It was the survival instinct
  screaming at her to fold, to prioritize blood over badge. But as a detective, she
  knew the math. If Vincent went free, the body count would inevitably rise. Could
  she trade Amy’s life for the future victims? Could Amy live with the guilt of knowing
  her freedom cost the safety of the city? The moral geometry didn''t add up. Compliance
  was a trap.


  She drove to the precinct, the weight of the badge on her hip feeling heavier than
  usual. She found Detective Marcus Webb in the breakroom, pouring lukewarm coffee.
  He was her anchor, the man who always followed the book.


  "I need a task force, Marcus," she said, her voice low and trembling. "They have
  Amy. It’s Marchetti."


  Webb’s eyes widened, his cop brain instantly shifting to tactical solutions. "We
  go to Morrison immediately. We get SWAT, wiretaps, the full weight of the Bureau.
  We don''t negotiate with terrorists, Sarah. We bring the hammer down."


  It sounded right. It sounded like the procedure she’d sworn to uphold. But Sarah’s
  mind was already dissecting the plan, finding the flaws in the armor. The Marchetti
  organization had tentacles deep inside the department; leaks were inevitable. Official
  channels meant paperwork, warrants, and jurisdictional pissing matches. By the time
  a tactical team cleared the legal hurdles, Amy would be a message written in blood.


  "Protocol will get her killed," Sarah whispered, the realization cold and sharp
  in her gut. "The system is too slow, and it’s compromised."


  Webb reached out to stop her, but she stepped back. She saw the path now. To save
  her sister and put Marchetti away, she couldn''t be Detective Chen anymore. The
  rules were the problem. She had to break the law to enforce it.


  She turned and walked out, leaving her partner and her safety behind.'
