output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful." Sophie paused. "But the meditation retreat—that
  changed things. Five days of silence. You learn a lot about yourself when you can''t
  run from your own thoughts."


  Her phone buzzed. Then again. Sophie glanced at it—work emails piling up, Linda''s
  name appearing twice with urgent flags. The Pearson account. Three emergencies,
  apparently.


  Her thumb hovered over the screen.


  Then she set the phone face-down on her lap.


  "Don''t you need to answer that?" her mother asked, surprised.


  "It can wait until morning."


  Her mother glanced over. "Since when?"


  "Since I spent a week watching monks who own nothing look more peaceful than I''ve
  ever felt." Sophie watched the highway lights blur past. "Linda''s emergencies have
  been emergencies for three years. They''ll still be emergencies tomorrow. Tonight,
  I''m here."


  The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through the evening haze. Sophie''s apartment
  building. The coffee shop where she bought her morning latte. Everything exactly
  as she''d left it—but she was seeing it differently now. The relentless pace she''d
  maintained, the constant availability, the way work had colonized every quiet moment.


  "It''s good to be home," she said. And for the first time in years, she meant the
  feeling of it, not the returning to productivity.


  Her phone buzzed again. Sophie let it.'
