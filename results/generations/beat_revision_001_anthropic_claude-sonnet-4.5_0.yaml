output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. "Tell me—does your brother''s
  blood still stain your memories?"


  The words hit harder than any claw could. Kira''s breath caught. How did it know?


  "He begged you to run," the dragon hissed, circling. "But you froze. You watched
  him die."


  "No—" But the protest died in her throat. It was true. She''d been paralyzed with
  fear while her brother fought alone.


  She charged anyway, desperate to silence the voice. The battle was brutal. Flame
  scorched her armor. Claws raked across her shield. Twice she was knocked down. Twice
  she forced herself up. But the third time, pinned beneath its talons, the dragon''s
  burning eyes filled her vision.


  "You failed him then. You fail now."


  Something inside her shattered. She couldn''t breathe. Couldn''t move. The weight
  wasn''t the dragon''s claw—it was the truth crushing her chest. She *had* failed.
  She *was* failing. Again.


  The darkness closed in.


  But in that void, a different memory surfaced: her brother''s last words, not his
  death scream. "Kira, *live.*"


  Not "fight." Not "be brave." *Live.*


  She''d been running toward death ever since, trying to erase her guilt through heroic
  sacrifice. But he hadn''t wanted a hero. He''d wanted her alive.


  The realization burned through her like lightning. This wasn''t about redemption.
  It was about survival—hers, her village''s, the future her brother had died to give
  her.


  She wasn''t fighting to make up for the past. She was fighting for what remained.


  When the dragon lunged again, overconfident, she saw her opening with crystal clarity.
  She drove her sword through the gap in its scales, piercing its heart.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar.


  Kira knelt beside it, no longer the girl who''d frozen in fear. She''d died under
  those talons—and someone stronger had risen.'
