output: 'The airlock cycled with a hiss that sounded dangerously like a gasp, and
  the heavy magnetic doors slid open. Jin expected a sanctuary; he stepped into a
  bazaar of desperation.


  Processing wasn''t a sterile government hall, but a chaotic junction of durasteel
  and neon. The gravity here was lighter, perhaps point-eight G, making his stomach
  churn with every step. The air smelled of ozone, recycled sweat, and something metallic
  that tasted like blood on his tongue. People moved with fluid, predatory grace—Spacers,
  their limbs elongated by years in orbit, their skin pale and mapped with interface
  ports.


  Jin approached a kiosk marked *Immigration & Allocation*. "I need asylum," he said,
  his voice trembling slightly. "I have data. Valuable data."


  The woman behind the glass didn''t look up from her screen. "Asylum is a terrestrial
  concept, Earthworm. Here, you pay for volume. Cubic meters of air, water, data storage.
  What’s your buy-in?"


  "I... I have credits. Global Council standard."


  She finally looked at him, her eyes modified with iridescent apertures. She laughed,
  a sharp, barking sound. "Earth script? Useless. The blockade froze all transfers
  an hour ago. You’re destitute, kid. Move along before I charge you for loitering."


  Jin drifted away, the crowd parting around him like water around a stone. He was
  invisible, a ghost with a pocket full of treason and empty hands. He found a quiet
  corner near a viewing port, clutching the drive containing the carbon capture algorithms—the
  key to saving a dying world, now nothing more than a paperweight.


  "You look like you''re trying to calculate the jump back down without a chute,"
  a gravelly voice murmured.


  Jin startled. Leaning against a bulkhead was a man who looked as old as the station
  itself. His face was a roadmap of radiation burns, and his left arm was a skeletal
  mechanical prosthetic.


  "I''m looking for the administration," Jin said, straightening up. "I have technology
  that can rewrite the atmospheric scrubbers on Earth."


  "I know who you are, Jin," the old man said. "I’m Silas. I used to be a structural
  engineer in Beijing before the Great Smog. Now? I keep the air flowing in Sector
  4. Come with me."


  Desperate for any anchor in this drifting world, Jin followed. Silas led him away
  from the promenade, down through the labyrinthine bowels of the station where the
  hum of machinery vibrated in their marrow.


  "You think you brought us a gift," Silas said, opening a hatch into a massive, humid
  chamber. "But you didn''t."


  Jin stared. Before him stood a towering complex of filtration banks, pulsing with
  a familiar blue light. The geometry of the intake manifolds, the molecular separation
  membranes—it was his design. Or rather, it was the design he had sacrificed his
  life to leak.


  "You have it," Jin whispered. "The Collective... you''re already using the protocol."


  "We''ve used it for a decade," Silas said, wiping grease from his mechanical hand.
  "Why do you think the Council suppressed your research? Not because it didn''t work.
  But because the lattice structure requires zero-gravity manufacturing to remain
  stable. Earth can’t build this, Jin. Only *we* can."


  The realization hit Jin with the force of a depressurization. The Council hadn''t
  just been protecting oil interests; they were terrified of total dependency. If
  this technology was the only cure for the climate collapse, Earth would be beholden
  to the Orbital Collective for every breath they took.


  "The Council wanted to bury it to keep their sovereignty," Silas continued, his
  voice devoid of pity. "The Collective keeps it quiet because we''re waiting for
  the price to go up. We don''t want to save Earth, boy. We want to own it."


  Jin looked at the humming machines. He had come here to find a platform to distribute
  the truth, to give the technology freely to his home. Instead, he found the monopoly
  he had unknowingly served.


  "So, here is the offer," Silas said, gesturing to a console overlooking the manufacturing
  floor. "We need a lead engineer to oversee the mass production of export units.
  The High Command has decided the time is right to squeeze the planet dry. You know
  the tech better than anyone. You run the program, you get safety, resources, and
  a lab that dreams are made of."


  "And if I refuse?"


  "Then you''re just another broke refugee breathing expensive air."


  Jin looked at the blue light of the scrubbers. He thought of Yuna, choking on the
  smog in Seoul. He thought of his parents. If he took the job, he could ensure the
  technology actually reached them. He could save the biosphere.


  But the cost would be an economic stranglehold that would enslave his home world
  to the Spacers for a century.


  Jin stepped up to the console. The interface hummed, waiting for his biometric handshake.
  He wanted to be a savior, but the universe only offered him the role of a merchant.


  He placed his hand on the scanner. "I''ll need a full team," Jin said, his voice
  hardening as the system logged him in. "And I set the production schedule."


  The screen flashed green: *ACCESS GRANTED*.


  He had found his sanctuary, and all it cost him was his conscience.'
