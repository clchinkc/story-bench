output: 'Yuki''s scanner beeped softly as she entered the crew quarters, its blue
  light cutting through the crimson gloom. Rows of bunks stood empty, sheets rumpled
  as if their occupants had just stepped out. She swept the device over a nearby terminal,
  pulling up the last logs. Entries cut off mid-sentence: "Experiment showing promise—dimensional
  barriers thinning—" followed by garbled text and a timestamp from three days ago.
  Her scientific mind raced; dimensional barriers? That sounded like theoretical quantum
  entanglement, but applied to biology? Dread coiled in her stomach, mixing with the
  determination that had driven her across the solar system.


  A faint whisper echoed from the shadows, like wind through a cracked hull—but the
  station was sealed. She froze, heart pounding. Something shimmered at the edge of
  her vision, a distortion like heat rising from metal grating. It lunged toward her,
  not solid, but enough to make her scanner glitch and spark. Yuki stumbled back,
  slamming into a locker. "Stay back!" she shouted, more to steady herself than anything.
  The shimmer retreated, leaving a chill in the air. Not a hallucination—her scanner
  registered anomalous energy signatures, phasing in and out of detectable spectra.
  Whatever it was, it felt... watchful. Threatening.


  She pushed on, overriding her fear with logic. The crew hadn''t vanished; they''d
  changed. But how? Clutching her tablet, she followed a trail of flickering emergency
  lights to the medical bay, two levels down. The door hissed open reluctantly, its
  mechanism gummed with a strange, iridescent residue. Inside, med-scanners hummed
  erratically, displays showing vital signs that flatlined then spiked into impossible
  readings—heart rates in negative values, brain waves oscillating beyond human norms.
  A half-finished autopsy report on a console described "cellular decoherence" in
  a test subject, with notes on Kronin''s Disease trials. Clues clicked: the cure
  involved manipulating quantum states, but something had gone wrong. Or right, in
  a horrifying way.


  Another shimmer appeared, this time blocking the exit—multiple now, swirling like
  predatory ghosts, their whispers growing to a cacophony that clawed at her mind.
  Panic surged; the air thickened, life support alarms blaring as oxygen levels dipped.
  Yuki''s breath came short. Think, she commanded herself. Scientific method: observe,
  hypothesize, test. She recalibrated her scanner to emit a counter-frequency pulse,
  based on the energy readings. The device whined, and the shimmers recoiled, parting
  like mist before a fan. The obstacle cleared, but her hands shook—those weren''t
  mere anomalies. They were the crew, or what remained.


  Gathering the fragments of data, she pieced together a destination: Lab Seven, core
  of the experiments. The station''s map showed it sealed behind a security lockdown.
  With renewed resolve, Yuki hacked the override using protocols from the logs, the
  door grinding open to reveal the path ahead. The whispers followed, urgent now,
  almost pleading. She pressed on, dread deepening, but so did her determination to
  uncover the truth.'
