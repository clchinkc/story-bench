output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "Life-changing." Sophie''s phone buzzed with notifications, but she left it in her
  bag. "I learned to sit with discomfort instead of running from it."


  Her mother glanced over, surprised. Usually Sophie would be checking emails before
  they''d even left the parking garage.


  The phone buzzed again. Then again. Sophie felt the familiar pull, the anxiety of
  being disconnected. Three weeks ago, she would have already been scrolling through
  messages. Instead, she took a deep breath, feeling her feet on the car floor, watching
  the highway lights blur past.


  "Aren''t you going to check that?" her mother asked.


  Sophie pulled out her phone. Three emergencies while she was gone. Linda needed
  her to call tonight about the Pearson account. The old Sophie would have been typing
  responses immediately, heart racing with urgency.


  "Tomorrow," Sophie said, putting the phone in airplane mode. "Linda survived three
  weeks without me. She can survive one more night."


  The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through the evening haze. Sophie''s apartment
  building. The same coffee shop where she used to grab her morning latte while checking
  emails. Everything exactly as she''d left it, but she was seeing it differently
  now—noticing how the city lights reflected off the lake, how her shoulders had been
  permanently hunched forward before.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, meaning it in a way she never had before.'
