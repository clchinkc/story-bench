output: 'For seventy-two hours, the photograph was her world. Sarah spread every case
  file, every known associate report, across her kitchen table, her analytical mind
  seeking a loophole. The cop in her screamed to follow protocol: report the threat,
  get Amy into protective custody, let the system work. The sister in her saw Amy’s
  terrified eyes in the photo and knew the system moved too slow.


  She considered recanting. One lie, and Amy walks free. The thought was a seductive
  poison. She imagined walking into court, uttering the words, watching Vincent Marchetti’s
  smug smile as he walked. Her career would be over, her integrity ash, but Amy would
  be alive. Yet, how long before Marchetti came for her next? Or for Amy again, to
  tie up loose ends? Compliance wasn’t safety; it was surrender.


  The next morning, she went to the only person she trusted: her partner, Detective
  Marcus Webb. In a quiet corner of the precinct garage, away from prying ears, she
  laid it out, omitting only the explicit threat.


  “Webb, I need a favor. Off-book. My sister’s in trouble.”


  Webb’s face, usually relaxed, tightened. “What kind of trouble?”


  “The kind that needs a full protective detail. Now. And a deep, quiet search on
  some warehouses.”


  He studied her, seeing the shadows under her eyes. “Sarah, you know the drill. We
  file a report, I’ll back you, but we have to go through channels. Captain, then—”


  “Channels are leaky,” she hissed, the words tasting like the kidnapper’s digital
  voice. “What if the wrong person sees the request?”


  “Then we go to Internal Affairs. We work the system, Chen. It’s what we do.” His
  hand was on her shoulder, solid, earnest. “We’ll get her back. The right way.”


  *The right way.* She looked at his honest face, and in that moment, she saw the
  fatal flaw. His faith was in a system she now saw as riddled with invisible cracks,
  a system Marchetti had already breached. Going official would trigger alerts. It
  would create a paper trail for moles to follow, putting a target on Webb’s back
  and a timer on Amy’s life.


  “You’re right,” she said, the lie smooth and cold. “Thanks, Marcus.”


  Walking away, the debate crystallized into terrible clarity. There was no path within
  the lines. To save her sister, she had to step outside them. To do her duty, she
  had to break her oath. The third option, terrifying and clear, was the only one
  left.'
