output: 'Thomas rose slowly, his chair scraping against the marble floor. The courtroom
  held its breath.


  "Dr. Okonkwo, you spent twelve years at Meridian Pharmaceuticals. Can you tell the
  court what your role was?"


  Her voice was steady at first. "I directed clinical research trials. Oversaw safety
  protocols."


  "And when you raised concerns about Trial 2147, what happened?"


  She hesitated. The pause stretched like a rubber band pulled to breaking. "I...
  I was told my concerns were noted. That the data supported continued trials."


  Thomas felt the shift in the room. The defense leaned forward. Judge Wright''s jaw
  tightened.


  "But you had documentation," Thomas pressed. "Reports of adverse reactions that
  were buried."


  "I had documents that I believed—"


  "Your Honor," the defense interrupted. "Counsel is leading the witness."


  "Sustained. Mr. Wright, approach the witness directly."


  Thomas circled the prosecution table, his shoes echoing in the silent room. He stopped
  ten feet from Dr. Okonkwo, studying her face. The fear was still there, raw and
  unmistakable. But beneath it, something else. A woman torn between two impossible
  choices—her daughter''s life and her integrity.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," he said, his voice dropping so the jury leaned in to hear. "Before
  Meridian, you worked at St. Catherine''s Children''s Hospital. Why did you leave?"


  The question caught her off guard. "I wanted larger-scale impact. More resources
  for research."


  "Did you become a doctor to help people?"


  "Of course."


  "Seventeen people died because those reports never reached the FDA. seventeen families
  who will never see their mothers, their fathers, their children again." Thomas paused.
  "I understand you have a daughter."


  The gallery murmured. Dr. Okonkwo''s composure cracked. "Please—"


  "I know what they''re holding over you. And I know I cannot promise you anything.
  I cannot save your daughter. No one in this courtroom can make that guarantee."


  The defense team''s expressions shifted from hope to confusion. Even Judge Wright
  looked up sharply.


  "But I can tell you this." Thomas stepped closer. "Whatever you decide today, I
  will do everything in my power to find another trial. Another option. Not because
  you testify—but because you deserve to know that telling the truth doesn''t mean
  sacrificing your child."


  Dr. Okonkwo stared at him, searching his face for deception.


  "The documents you have," Thomas said quietly. "They show exactly what Meridian
  did. All of it. You kept them for a reason. What was that reason?"


  Her voice broke, but this time, the fear had transformed into something else. Resolve.


  "Because someone had to." She drew a shaky breath. "Because the seventeen dead deserve
  a voice."


  She looked past Thomas, directly at Meridian''s CEO, whose smile had faded entirely.


  "I have the complete documentation of every suppressed report. Every altered trial
  result. And I am prepared to submit them all."'
