output: "Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected\
  \ her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with\
  \ the car.\n\n\"How was Thailand?\" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.\n\
  \n\"Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos.\"\n\n\"And the meditation\
  \ retreat?\"\n\n\"It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly.\" Sophie glanced\
  \ at her phone, but instead of diving into work emails, she took a deep breath,\
  \ relishing the moment. \"Linda's probably in a panic over the Pearson account.\
  \ She needs me to call tonight.\"\n\n\"Can't it wait until morning?\"\n\n\"You know\
  \ how it is,\" Sophie replied, but her tone was lighter. \"I'll get to it. But first,\
  \ I want to enjoy being back.\"\n\nThey drove in silence for a while. The familiar\
  \ Chicago skyline appeared through the evening haze. Sophie's apartment building.\
  \ The coffee shop where she bought her morning latte. Everything exactly as she'd\
  \ left it, yet now it felt different, almost vibrant.\n\n\"It's good to be home,\"\
  \ she said, a smile creeping onto her face. No longer was her mind consumed by deadlines;\
  \ instead, she envisioned a fresh perspective on her priorities. \n\nLife went on,\
  \ but this time, she carried a clarity that would reshape how she approached it."
