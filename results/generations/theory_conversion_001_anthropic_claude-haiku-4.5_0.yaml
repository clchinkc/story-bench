output: 'Dr. Samira Hassan had spent fifteen years building her reputation as a virologist,
  publishing papers that shaped how the world understood emerging pathogens. Her lab
  at the university was her sanctuary, a place where rigorous science guided every
  decision. She believed in protocols, peer review, and the inherent goodness of institutions
  designed to protect public health. It was a comfortable world, orderly and predictable.


  Then Patient Zero arrived.


  The anomalous protein structure on her screen at two in the morning shattered that
  certainty. Samira called Raj into the lab, their eyes meeting in recognition of
  something that shouldn''t exist. "Run it again," she whispered. He did. The results
  were identical. The virus was impossible according to every model she''d studied,
  every principle she''d taught.


  "What do we do?" Raj asked.


  She picked up the phone and called the CDC. "We have a potential Level 4 outbreak."


  The next seventy-two hours collapsed into a nightmare of escalation. Containment
  teams arrived in hazmat suits. The hospital locked its doors. More patients appeared
  with the same impossible symptoms, their bodies ravaged by something that adapted
  faster than it should, evolving as if guided by intention rather than chance. Samira
  worked without sleep, surrounded by colleagues now afraid of contamination, afraid
  of each other, afraid of her.


  "It''s not mutating randomly," she told Raj at hour sixty, her voice hollow. "It''s
  designed. Someone engineered this."


  She pulled Patient Zero''s employment history and found it: Nexus Biotech. A company
  that had quietly purchased gene-editing patents for years, operating in the shadows
  of regulatory oversight. The implications crystallized into terror. This wasn''t
  nature''s cruelty. This was deliberate.


  The confrontation came twelve hours before quarantine failure, at the moment when
  everything hung suspended between containment and catastrophe. Samira arrived at
  Nexus headquarters with her proof, her data, her iron-clad evidence of what they''d
  created. But lawyers filled conference rooms. PR teams prepared statements. A senator
  took their calls. They would bury her, bury the truth, bury everyone.


  Unless she moved first.


  The press conference erupted into chaos before she finished her opening statement.
  Accusations flew. Nexus denied everything while simultaneously threatening lawsuits.
  News cameras captured the simultaneous release of the cure formula—the one she''d
  engineered in those sleepless hours—distributed to every major medical journal and
  news outlet globally. "You can sue me into oblivion," she said into the microphones,
  her voice steady despite the destruction unfolding around her, "but you can''t patent
  something that belongs to everyone."


  The outbreak contained itself within weeks, dismantled by thousands of doctors using
  her formula. Federal agents arrived at Nexus with warrants. The investigations would
  take years, winding through corporate structures and political connections.


  But Dr. Samira Hassan''s career at major institutions was finished. Universities
  and hospitals turned away from her, afraid of association, of Nexus''s legal machinery,
  of her now-radioactive name. She found freelance work, consulting positions that
  paid barely enough, and discovered something unexpected in this professional exile:
  peace. Her reputation was destroyed, but her integrity remained intact. She''d chosen
  lives over prestige, and in the quiet aftermath, that choice felt like the only
  victory that mattered. The world had changed, and so had she, transformed into someone
  who could live with the cost of doing what was right.'
