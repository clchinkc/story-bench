output: 'The morning found Elena in the back room of "Marcus''s Curios," surrounded
  by dusty artifacts she couldn''t name. She had come for a guidebook, something practical
  to prove the map a fantasy. Instead, she found its owner watching her with unsettling
  clarity.


  "You left this glowing on your table all night," Marcus said, placing the map before
  her. He was old, his face a topography of scars, but his eyes were bright. "It tends
  to draw unwanted attention."


  Elena flushed. "How did you—"


  "I know a seeking spell when I see one pulsing through a village window." He leaned
  on his counter. "You told your grandmother''s ghost you''re ordinary. Catalog books,
  was it?"


  "Among other useless skills," she muttered.


  "Precise language, attention to detail, knowledge of historical context," Marcus
  listed, tapping the map''s runes. "The Thornwood is a text, Elena. One written in
  living bark and ancient magic. It doesn''t care about swords. It cares about reading
  it correctly."


  He moved to a cluttered shelf, returning with a worn leather satchel and a brass
  compass. "These are for you. The compass points to intent, not north. The bag...
  well, it holds what you need, not what you think you need." He saw her expression.
  "No, I''m not coming. My path doesn''t lie that way anymore."


  "This is madness," Elena whispered, but her hand closed around the compass. It was
  warm.


  "Perhaps," Marcus agreed. "But the map chose a reader. Maybe it needs one." He met
  her eyes. "Go before sunset. And trust your first skill, librarian. In there, knowing
  how to look is the only weapon that matters."


  Elena left the shop, the satchel lighter than it should be, the compass a quiet
  weight in her pocket. The refusal still sat on her tongue, but beneath it, a terrible,
  curious question had begun to form: *What if I can read this?*'
