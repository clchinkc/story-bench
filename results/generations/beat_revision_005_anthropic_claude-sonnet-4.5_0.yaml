  This segment properly executes the Dark Night of the Soul beat. It demonstrates
  all five key requirements: (1) follows the gallery closure defeat, (2) Maya is physically
  and emotionally isolated in her dark apartment, (3) shows genuine despair through
  broken promises and exhausted options, (4) explicitly states there are no solutions
  ("nothing left to do"), and (5) incorporates death through the mother''s hospice
  memory and the gallery''s symbolic death. The pacing allows for proper wallowing
  without rushing to hope, and the final line "tonight, she let herself break" perfectly
  captures the surrendering to despair that defines this beat.'
