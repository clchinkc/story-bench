  Sarah paced her small living room, the floorboards creaking a familiar rhythm. Her
  first instinct was survival: do what they asked. If she recanted on Monday, Vincent
  Marchetti walked, but Amy lived. It was a simple equation. But Vincent was a monster
  who had executed a witness in broad daylight. If he walked, how many more Amys would
  there be? And could she trust a psychopath to honor a deal once his freedom was
  secured? No. Compliance was a gamble with loaded dice.


  Her second instinct was procedure. Call it in. Get a tactical team.


  She drove to the precinct, her mind racing through the logistics of a hostage rescue.
  At her desk, she found Marcus Webb nursing a lukewarm coffee. He saw her face and
  straightened immediately.


  "Sarah? You look like hell."


  She pulled him into a quiet stairwell, showing him the photo but hiding the note
  about the trial. "They have Amy."


  Marcus’s face hardened. "We lock this down. I’ll get the Captain. We’ll trace the
  call, get a geolocation on that warehouse background—"


  "If the department gets involved, they kill her, Marcus. They’re watching."


  "We can be discreet," Marcus insisted, his hand already reaching for his radio.
  "We have protocols for this. You can''t do this alone."


  "Protocols?" Sarah laughed, a sharp, bitter sound. "Like the protocols that let
  Marchetti know where our last safehouse was? We have a leak, Marcus. Maybe in dispatch,
  maybe in the Captain''s office. If I file an official report, that report lands
  on Marchetti’s desk before the ink dries."


  Marcus hesitated, his hand dropping. He knew she was right. The department was compromised.


  "Then what?" he whispered. "You can''t just let him walk."


  "No," Sarah said, the realization crystallizing in her gut like ice. "I can''t let
  him walk. And I can''t use the law to stop him because the law is broken."


  She looked at her badge clipped to her belt. It was a shield, but right now, it
  was just a target. To save Amy, she needed to be invisible. She needed to operate
  in the dark, where Marchetti lived.


  "I need to go, Marcus."


  "Where?"


  "To do what the police can''t."'
