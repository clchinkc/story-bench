output: 'Dr. Samira Hassan had spent fifteen years building her reputation as a virologist,
  methodically climbing from graduate research to heading her own lab at Metropolitan
  Hospital. Her days followed predictable rhythms—grant applications, peer reviews,
  teaching rounds with residents. She''d published extensively on viral transmission
  models, become the person colleagues called when they encountered diagnostic mysteries.
  It was a good life, stable and respected.


  Then Patient Zero arrived on a Tuesday morning, and the protein structure on her
  screen showed something that shouldn''t exist.


  Samira stared at the data, ran it three more times, then felt her stomach drop.
  The virus violated every model she''d studied. "Raj," she called to her assistant,
  "get the CDC on the line. We need an emergency containment team."


  "Are you sure?" Raj asked. "If this is a false alarm—"


  "If I''m wrong, my career''s over. If I''m right, we''re all in danger." She met
  his eyes. "Make the call. Tell them potential Level 4 outbreak."


  The next seventy-two hours consumed her. The containment team descended in hazmat
  suits and military efficiency. The hospital was quarantined, corridors transformed
  into sterile zones marked by yellow tape and armed guards. More patients arrived
  with impossible symptoms—fever patterns that made no sense, cellular damage that
  looked almost surgical in its precision. Samira worked without sleep, racing against
  a pathogen that evolved faster than she could study it.


  At hour sixty, surrounded by failed test results and coffee cups, she looked at
  Raj. "We''re missing something. It''s not mutating randomly. It''s adapting. Like
  it''s designed to."


  The word hung between them. Designed.


  She pulled up Patient Zero''s file again, scanning for what she''d overlooked in
  the initial panic. Employment history: low-level technician. Current employer: Nexus
  Biotech. Her hands trembled as she cross-referenced the other patients. Three of
  them had Nexus connections. She began pulling patent filings, research publications,
  finding Nexus everywhere in the shadows of gene-editing technology.


  "Oh god," Samira whispered. "Someone made this."


  At hour eighty-four, twelve hours before the quarantine was projected to fail, Nexus''s
  legal team arrived with a senator and three lawyers in thousand-dollar suits. They
  cornered her in the research lab, all smiles and veiled threats.


  "Dr. Hassan, we understand you''ve made certain accusations," the lead attorney
  said. "Nexus Biotech strongly denies any involvement in this unfortunate outbreak.
  We''re prepared to assist your investigation, of course, but reckless speculation
  could be... damaging. To everyone."


  The senator leaned forward. "Think carefully about your next move."


  Samira looked at the cure formula on her laptop, the result of sleepless nights
  and desperate experimentation. She''d cracked it only hours ago. Nexus would patent
  it, control it, profit from the very disaster they''d created.


  "I have thought carefully," she said, and hit send.


  The press conference was chaos. Samira stood before cameras and microphones, Nexus''s
  lawyers shouting objections, as she explained everything—the engineered virus, the
  corporate connections, and most importantly, the cure she''d just transmitted to
  every major news outlet and medical journal worldwide.


  "You can sue me into oblivion," she told the cameras, voice steady, "but you can''t
  patent something that belongs to everyone."


  Nexus''s denials were drowned out by reporter questions. The senator fled. The lawyers
  threatened lawsuits that felt suddenly hollow.


  Six weeks later, the outbreak was contained. Nexus faced federal investigation,
  its executives already lawyering up. Dr. Samira Hassan found herself unemployable
  at any major institution—no hospital would touch someone who''d burned so many powerful
  bridges.


  But standing in the small community clinic that had offered her a position, watching
  recovered patients pick up their children from school, she felt something she hadn''t
  experienced in years: peace with her choices. The work would continue, just on different
  terms.'
