output: 'Detective Rachel Torres ran her thumb along the worn edge of the Jensen cold
  case file at 5:47 AM on a Tuesday morning in October, her third cup of black coffee
  going cold on the Queens windowsill. Sherlock butted his head against her leg, the
  white scar tissue on his ear catching the early light. She''d pulled him from behind
  crime scene tape two years back; now he was the only one who tolerated her pre-dawn
  case reviews.


  The radio played Miles Davis. She''d owned that same station since her father retired
  from the force.


  At Riverside Precinct, Detective James Oyelaran already had her coffee waiting—black,
  no sugar—on the desk they shared. He didn''t look up from the evidence log.


  ''The Jensen file?'' he asked.


  ''Found something.'' She dropped it between them. ''Witness mentioned a dog. Animal
  control picked up a stray that night, but the pickup time—''


  ''—doesn''t match the 911 call,'' he finished, a rare smile touching his lips. ''Told
  you that cat would sharpen your instincts.''


  The precinct buzzed around them, a mix of calls from waterfront condos and the old
  brick apartments where property crimes had climbed fifteen percent this quarter.
  Three years of this rhythm—him anticipating her hunches, her trusting his evidence
  work without question.


  ''Let''s haunt this thing until it breaks,'' she said.


  Outside, October leaves scuttled past the precinct steps. Everything was about to
  change. '
