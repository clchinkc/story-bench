output: 'Yuki’s scanner pulsed a rhythmic blue light against the corridor walls, the
  only steady thing in a world tilted off its axis. The air tasted metallic, recycled
  too many times without the scrubbers running at full capacity. She moved first toward
  the mess hall, theorizing that a sudden event would leave traces in communal spaces.


  The mess hall was frozen in a tableau of interrupted life. Trays half-eaten, a coffee
  mug overturned with the spill dried into a dark crust. But it was the silence that
  felt heavy, almost physical. As she stepped over a fallen chair, her peripheral
  vision caught movement—a distortion in the air, like heat rising from asphalt. She
  whipped her head around. Nothing. Just the red emergency strobe reflecting off stainless
  steel.


  "Atmospheric pressure normal," she muttered, grounding herself in data. "Toxins
  negative."


  She pressed on to the Medical Bay. The door was jammed, the hydraulic seal fused.
  Yuki braced her foot against the bulkhead and strained, grunting as she forced the
  manual override. The doors hissed open, revealing a chaotic scene. Monitors were
  smashed, and medical logs were scattered across the floor like fallen leaves.


  She knelt to examine a discarded tablet. The final entry was a jagged scrawl of
  biometrics: heart rates spiking to impossible levels, then flatlining simultaneously
  across the entire crew roster.


  "Mass cardiac event?" she whispered. But that didn''t explain the bodies. There
  were no bodies.


  A sudden chill prickled her neck. The distortion was back, hovering near the cryo-tanks.
  This time, it had a shape—vaguely humanoid, shimmering with an iridescence that
  hurt her eyes. It lunged. Yuki scrambled backward, crashing into a supply cart.
  The entity passed *through* the cart, dissolving into a mist of static electricity
  that made her teeth ache.


  Panic flared, but her scientific training clamped down on it. It wasn''t a ghost.
  It was energy.


  She needed access to the secure labs. The main lift was dead, its controls unresponsive.
  Yuki eyed the maintenance ladder, a dark throat descending into the station''s bowels.
  She slung her scanner over her shoulder and began the climb. Halfway down, the rungs
  vibrated violently. Below her, the darkness swirled with those same impossible colors,
  a whirlpool of silent screams. She forced herself to look away, focusing only on
  the next rung, the next breath, until her boots hit the deck of the research level.


  The hallway to Lab Seven stretched out before her, the air thick with ozone and
  the undeniable sense that she was being watched by a thousand unseen eyes.'
