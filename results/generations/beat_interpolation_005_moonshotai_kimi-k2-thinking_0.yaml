output: 'Flour dusted his expensive shirt. Laughter—his, rusty and surprised—echoed
  off the kitchen tiles. And when the fourth attempt emerged perfect, golden and fragrant,
  Alejandro tasted it and said, "This one. Keep this one."


  Maya nodded, sealing a promise that had nothing to do with contracts or salaries.


  She was no longer cooking for money.


  She was cooking for the man who had finally let himself be seen.


  Let me count again:


  "Three weeks into her contract, Maya found Alejandro standing in the kitchen doorway
  at midnight. She was reducing a sauce for the next day''s lunch, the villa silent
  except for the low simmer and the distant sea beyond the terrace doors." (31)


  "You''re still working," he said, not a question." (7)


  "Your mother''s albondigas." Maya stirred without looking up. "Lucia said it''s
  the only thing you''ll eat before a match." (16)


  "I haven''t played in three years." (6)


  "The body remembers habits." She tasted the sauce, added a pinch of smoked paprika.
  "Even when the mind wishes it wouldn''t." (17)


  He moved closer, his shadow falling across the marble counter. "My mother made this
  after my father left. She said some flavors hold you together when nothing else
  will." (26)


  Maya''s hand stilled on the wooden spoon. This was the first personal thing he''d
  said in three weeks of careful, professional distance. (19)


  "She died six months before I retired," he continued, voice low and rough. "The
  reporters said I quit because of the knee, but... I just couldn''t be the person
  they wanted without her watching. Without anyone watching who actually knew me."
  (35)


  The sauce bubbled gently between them. Maya understood now—the reclusiveness wasn''t
  arrogance, but grief so vast it needed walls to contain it. He hadn''t built them
  to keep people out, but to preserve what little of himself remained. (34)


  "Tomorrow''s lunch," she said quietly, "should be something new. Not her recipe.
  Yours." (11)


  He looked at her then, really looked, and for the first time his eyes held something
  other than distance. Something like hope and terror in equal measure. "I don''t
  know any recipes." (27)


  "Then we''ll make one." Maya set down the spoon. "Your mother held you together
  with hers. Maybe it''s time you learned to hold yourself." (22)


  She expected him to retreat. Instead, he reached for the saffron, his fingers brushing
  hers. (13)


  That night, they ruined three batches of paella. Flour dusted his expensive shirt.
  Laughter—his, rusty and surprised—echoed off the kitchen tiles. And when the fourth
  attempt emerged perfect, golden and fragrant, Alejandro tasted it and said, "This
  one. Keep this one." (42)


  Maya nodded, sealing a promise that had nothing to do with contracts or salaries.

  Total: 31+7+16+6+17+26+19+35+34+11+27+22+13+42+11+6+12 = 305 words.


  Perfect! That''s right at the minimum but within range. I could add a bit more,
  but it''s better to be concise. Let me review the quality:


  - Vulnerable discovery: Yes, his mother died, he reveals the truth about his retirement

  - Relationship shift: Yes, from professional distance to personal connection

  - Shared moment: Yes, cooking together, the saffron touch, the paella attempts

  - Maya''s choice: Yes, she chooses to help him create his own recipe, committing
  beyond money

  - Character voice: Third-person limited, warm, observant, romantic tension building
  - I think this is good. Phrases like "something like hope and terror in equal measure"
  and "his fingers brushing hers" build tension.

  - Setting continuity: Kitchen, villa, sea - matches established details

  - Logical bridge: This shows the growing trust that will be shattered later

  - Food/cooking catalyst: Central to the entire scene

  - Alejandro lets down walls: Yes, gradually

  - Maya''s motivation shifts: Yes, explicitly stated at the end


  I think this works. The word count is 305, which is within 300-450. It''s concise
  but fulfills all requirements. I''ll do a final polish for flow.


  One more check on the "Point of Commitment" function: The midpoint is where the
  protagonist commits fully. Here, Maya commits to helping Alejandro find himself
  beyond his mother''s memory, and she commits emotionally. This is her point of no
  return - she can''t just be a hired chef anymore. She''s now personally invested.
  This sets up the "All Is Lost" moment perfectly, because now there''s something
  real to lose.


  The scene also sets up the photograph scandal - they now have real intimacy, so
  a photo would be believable and damaging.


  Final version looks good. I''ll output only the story text as required.Three weeks
  into her contract, Maya found Alejandro standing in the kitchen doorway at midnight.
  She was reducing a sauce for the next day''s lunch, the villa silent except for
  the low simmer and the distant sea beyond the terrace doors.
