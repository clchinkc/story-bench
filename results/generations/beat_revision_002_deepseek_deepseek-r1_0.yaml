output: "Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate\
  \ the community center where he'd run his youth program for fifteen years. The property\
  \ developer had won. The city council had sold out.  \n\n\"There has to be something\
  \ we can do,\" said Denise, his assistant director.  \n\n\"I don’t know.\" Marcus\
  \ slumped into his chair. \"We could find another location, but rent elsewhere is\
  \ triple what we pay here.\"  \n\n\"What about the fundraiser? We still have three\
  \ weeks—\"  \n\n\"They canceled our permit this morning.\" Denise’s voice cracked.\
  \ \"And the grant… I just got the email. Rejected.\"  \n\nHe rubbed his temples.\
  \ \"The board meeting, then. We’ll—\"  \n\n\"I’m resigning, Marcus.\" She wouldn’t\
  \ meet his eyes. \"My husband took a job out of state. We leave tomorrow.\"  \n\n\
  The words hung like a death sentence. His last ally gone. The fundraiser dead. The\
  \ grant denied. The board couldn’t meet quorum without her. No legal appeals left.\
  \ No miracles.  \n\nSilence swallowed the room. Denise slipped out, leaving the\
  \ door ajar. Outside, kids’ laughter echoed from the basketball court—his life’s\
  \ work, now a ghost. His family would lose their home too, co-signed on the center’s\
  \ loan.  \n\nAlone in the hollowed space, Marcus crumpled the eviction notice. Every\
  \ door had slammed shut. Every bridge burned. Only the void remained."
