output: 'Thomas straightened, his notepad trembling slightly as he approached Dr.
  Okonkwo. He had cross-examined hundreds of witnesses, but this woman held his entire
  case in her hands—and something far more fragile than a verdict.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," he began, his voice steady, "can you walk us through your role at
  Meridian''s research division?"


  She answered in clipped sentences, professional and distant. Thomas let her build
  a foundation of truth—her credentials, her integrity, the protocols she''d designed.
  Slowly, her shoulders relaxed. She wasn''t being attacked. She was simply being
  heard.


  "In March 2021," Thomas continued, "did you raise concerns about adverse reaction
  data in Trial Protocol 447?"


  "I did." Her voice was barely audible. The gallery leaned forward.


  "And what happened when you raised those concerns?"


  She closed her eyes. Long silence. Thomas saw her hands grip the witness chair''s
  arms.


  "They were... buried," she whispered.


  The defense attorney stood immediately. "Objection. Characterization."


  "Sustained."


  Thomas moved closer. "Dr. Okonkwo, where are those adverse reaction reports now?"


  Her eyes snapped open—not at him, but toward the gallery, where a man in a gray
  suit sat with a photograph in his lap. A young girl, maybe eight years old. Dr.
  Okonkwo''s daughter. Meridian''s leverage.


  "I..." She swallowed hard. "I don''t recall filing them in the appropriate—"


  Thomas did something then that violated every prosecutorial strategy in his playbook.
  He stepped directly in front of the witness stand, blocking her line of sight to
  that gray suit. Not confrontationally. Just present.


  "Dr. Okonkwo, look at me."


  She did.


  "Those seventeen people who died," Thomas said quietly, "they had daughters too.
  Sons. Families who thought the medication their doctors prescribed was safe. Because
  someone told them it was." He paused. "I need you to tell me what you know. Not
  what someone promised you. Not what you''re afraid of. What you *know* to be true."


  The silence stretched like breaking glass.


  Her chin trembled. Her voice, when it came, was thin and shattered: "The adverse
  reports were filed on March fifteenth. I have copies. They documented forty-seven
  serious adverse events before the medication was approved."


  The gallery erupted in whispers. The defense attorney''s face drained of color.
  Behind her, Dr. Okonkwo''s eyes met Thomas''s for just a moment—raw, exposed, choosing
  the only thing she could live with.


  He nodded once and stepped back.


  "Thank you, Doctor."'
