output: "Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling\
  \ hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,\
  \ exactly as the prophecies had described.\n\n\"You cannot defeat me, child,\" the\
  \ dragon rumbled, smoke curling from its jaws. \"Your brother begged for mercy too.\
  \ His blood still stains your hands.\"\n\nKira froze. The memory flooded back—her\
  \ hesitation during the goblin raid, her brother’s outstretched hand as he fell.\
  \ She’d carried that failure like chains. \"You lie!\" she shouted, but the dragon’s\
  \ laugh echoed through her bones.\n\nShe charged anyway. Flame scorched her armor.\
  \ Claws raked her shield. The first blow knocked her down, and the dragon’s voice\
  \ hissed, \"You failed him.\" She rose, choking on guilt. The second strike sent\
  \ her sprawling. \"He trusted you,\" the voice slithered. Blood ran from her forehead\
  \ as she pushed up again, trembling. When the third impact drove her to her knees,\
  \ the dragon loomed. \"You let him die.\" The truth crushed her—a death deeper than\
  \ any wound. She’d blamed fate, but the guilt was hers alone. \n\nIn that surrender,\
  \ clarity came. Her brother hadn’t died for her vengeance, but for her life. She\
  \ stopped fighting the past and gripped her sword anew—not in anger, but in penance.\
  \ As the dragon lunged, she saw the opening. With strength born of acceptance, she\
  \ drove her blade through the scale-gap. \n\nThe Shadow Dragon collapsed with an\
  \ earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body, exhaustion and sorrow mingling.\
  \ \"I’m sorry,\" she whispered to the wind, her victory hollow until now. The burden\
  \ hadn’t vanished, but she finally understood: redemption wasn’t in killing monsters,\
  \ but facing the one within. \n\nShe retrieved her sword and walked toward camp,\
  \ the weight lighter but the resolve forever changed."
