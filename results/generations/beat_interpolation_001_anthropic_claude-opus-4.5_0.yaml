output: 'The bell above the door of Marcus''s Curiosities chimed as Elena stepped
  inside, seeking refuge from the questions she couldn''t answer. She''d barely slept,
  and somehow her feet had carried her here—to the cluttered shop where she''d spent
  countless afternoons cataloging oddities for the old man who ran it.


  Marcus looked up from behind his counter, spectacles perched on his weathered nose.
  His eyes, sharp despite his years, found hers with unsettling directness.


  "You''ve seen the map," he said. Not a question.


  Elena stopped cold. "How did you—"


  "Because I''ve seen one too. Forty years ago." He gestured to the faded scar running
  from his temple to his jaw. "The Thornwood doesn''t call to just anyone, Elena.
  It calls to those who pay attention. Who notice what others miss."


  "I''m a librarian," she said, the words feeling hollow even to her.


  "Exactly." Marcus emerged from behind the counter, moving with a slight limp that
  spoke of old injuries. "You think heroes are forged from sword arms and battle cries?
  The Thornwood devours warriors who charge in blind. But someone who can read patterns,
  cross-reference details, remember the right story at the right moment?" He smiled.
  "That''s rarer than any magic."


  He pressed a worn leather satchel into her hands, followed by a brass compass that
  seemed to hum against her palm.


  "I can''t go with you—my adventuring days ended where this scar began. But I can
  tell you this: the forest tests intentions, not abilities. Trust what you know,
  not what you fear you lack."


  Elena stared at the compass, its needle already spinning with impossible purpose.
  She wasn''t ready. She might never be ready.


  But maybe ready wasn''t required. Maybe showing up was enough.


  "The map," she whispered. "It''s still on my grandmother''s table."


  "Then I suggest you go get it."'
