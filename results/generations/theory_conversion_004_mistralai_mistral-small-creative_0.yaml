  Zoe Chen had always known the quiet corners of the Millbrook Public Library better
  than she knew her own reflection. The summer after her junior year, she spent her
  shifts between the stacks, running her fingers along the spines of books like they
  were braille for a world she wasn’t quite part of. The library was her comfort zone—a
  place where stories happened to other people, where she could disappear into the
  lives of strangers without ever having to speak up in her own.


  What was missing? That was the question that gnawed at her, though she’d never admit
  it. She could lose herself in other people’s words, but when it came to her own
  voice? It was like trying to speak underwater. Her mother wanted her to get a "real"
  summer job, something with a paycheck and a purpose. Zoe just wanted to keep her
  head down and her hands busy.


  Then Ms. Okafor arrived, all sharp smiles and softer edges, and announced the oral
  history program. "Their stories deserve to be preserved," she said, gesturing to
  the town’s oldest residents like they were living archives. Zoe’s hand stayed firmly
  in her lap. Talking to strangers? Recording their voices? She could barely order
  coffee without rehearsing the words in her head first.


  But Ms. Okafor found her anyway, tucked between the biographies and the history
  section. "I saw you reading *Working* last week," she said, holding out a recorder
  like it was a peace offering. "You understand why stories matter. That’s rarer than
  you think." Zoe wanted to argue, but the weight of the recorder in her palm felt
  like a challenge. *Just one interview. Try.*


  So she did.


  Bernard Park’s house smelled like old books and peppermint tea. He was 89, a Korean
  War veteran with hands that trembled just slightly as he poured her a cup. Zoe’s
  questions were written on index cards, her voice barely above a whisper. The first
  interview was awkward. The second was worse. But by the fifth, something shifted.
  Bernard started to trust her, and Zoe realized that listening was its own kind of
  courage—one she hadn’t known she possessed.


  Her mother still didn’t understand. "You’re wasting your summer," she’d say, eyeing
  the recorder like it was a toy. But Bernard? He became her ally, the one who taught
  her that stories weren’t just words—they were bridges. "You’re the first person
  who ever asked the right questions," he told her one afternoon, his voice rough
  with something she couldn’t name. Then he dropped the real challenge: "I’ve never
  told anyone what really happened in Korea. But I’ll tell you—if you’ll share it."


  The town hall was packed. A hundred pairs of eyes, a microphone, and Bernard’s story—his
  survival, his guilt, his grace—spilling out of her like it was her own. Zoe’s hands
  shook, but her voice didn’t. When it was over, the applause felt like a wave, but
  what stayed with her was Bernard’s handshake, his eyes wet. "You heard me," he said.
  "That’s all any of us want."


  The summer ended. The program concluded. Other volunteers drifted away, but Zoe
  kept going back to Bernard’s house, kept recording, kept asking. She wasn’t just
  collecting stories anymore—she was part of them.


  When Bernard passed in October, his family asked her to speak at the funeral. This
  time, it wasn’t about giving voice to someone else’s truth. It was about her own:
  what Bernard had taught her about listening, about courage, about the stories that
  stitch us together. She stood there, in front of a room full of strangers, and she
  didn’t rehearse a single word.


  Senior year, she applied to journalism programs. Her essay was about Millbrook’s
  forgotten voices—the ones she’d spent a summer learning to hear. She still hesitated
  before ordering coffee, still felt the weight of her own silence sometimes. But
  she could stand in front of a hundred strangers and make them listen. And that,
  she decided, was enough.'
