output: "The apartment was dark when Maya finally unlocked the door. She didn't bother\
  \ with the lights. What was the point? The gallery had officially closed its doors\
  \ that morning, twenty years of her mother's legacy reduced to \"LEASE AVAILABLE\"\
  \ signs and the smell of industrial floor cleaner.\n\nShe sank onto the floor by\
  \ the window, still wearing her coat. The city lights blurred through the glass—or\
  \ maybe through her tears. She'd tried everything. The crowdfunding had fallen short.\
  \ The investors had walked. Even her brother had finally stopped answering her calls,\
  \ his silence a final admission that the fight was over. \n\nHer mother's last painting\
  \ hung on the wall opposite, barely visible in the darkness. A woman walking toward\
  \ an unseen horizon. Maya remembered sitting in the hospice, holding her mother's\
  \ paper-thin hand, promising she'd keep the gallery alive. \"It's not about the\
  \ art,\" her mother had whispered, her voice a ghost of its former strength. \"\
  It's about having a place where people can feel something real.\"\n\nMaya had failed\
  \ that promise. She had let the one living piece of her mother's spirit be extinguished\
  \ by overhead costs and missed deadlines. She felt the weight of it, a physical\
  \ pressure against her ribs that made every breath feel like a chore. She wasn't\
  \ just losing a business; she was losing her final connection to the woman who had\
  \ raised her.\n\nShe pulled her knees to her chest and let the silence swallow her\
  \ whole. Outside, the city kept moving—cars, sirens, the indifferent pulse of life—but\
  \ in here, time had stopped. There was nothing left to do. No calls to make. No\
  \ plans to execute. The identity she’d spent years building had vanished with the\
  \ turn of a key. \n\nTomorrow she'd have to figure out what comes next. But tonight,\
  \ she let herself break, sitting in the graveyard of her mother’s dreams."
