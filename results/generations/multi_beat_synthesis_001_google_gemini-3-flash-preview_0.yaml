output: 'The Buckingham Hotel’s grand ballroom had long ago traded its velvet elegance
  for the jagged architecture of despair. To any mundane squatter, it was a ruin of
  dust and broken glass, but to Dante, it was a riot of psychic scars. Shimmering
  ribbons of old laughter clung to the ceiling, while the floorboards were stained
  with the muddy brown of decades-old boredom. Kael stood by the shattered crystal
  chandelier, her fingers twitching with kinetic static that hummed like a disturbed
  beehive. She was a Vibrationist, able to turn sound into a weapon, and she clearly
  didn''t like what she saw in Dante. "You''re the one Rosa wasted her time on?" she
  spat, her eyes tracing the faded track marks on Dante’s inner elbows—the topographical
  map of a life he’d left behind three years ago. "You look like a ghost, Reyes. Or
  worse, a junkie looking for a hit of raw resonance to replace the needle. We don''t
  need tourists in the underground."


  Dante ignored the heat of the insult, focusing instead on the air between them.
  "I’m clean, Kael. And I see things you can’t feel." To prove it, he knelt in the
  center of the room, pulling a stub of white charcoal from his pocket—an artifact
  Rosa had infused with Clarification before the Siphon took her. The pressure was
  mounting; the hotel itself seemed to pulse with a predatory hunger. Dante closed
  his eyes, tuning out Kael’s static, and saw it: a smear of oily, necrotic gray snaking
  toward the service elevators. It wasn''t just a murder trail; it was a signature.
  "Silas was here," Dante whispered, pressing the charcoal to the floor. The white
  lead flared with a blinding light, absorbing the gray residue and projecting a shimmering,
  translucent playback of the betrayal. They watched as Silas, a trusted elder of
  the Resonant community, handed a skeleton key to a formless shadow. The revelation
  hit Kael like a physical blow. Her static died down, replaced by a grim, respectful
  silence. Dante’s hands shook, the weight of the truth heavier than any drug he’d
  ever taken. He had his ally, but the enemy was already inside.


  Deep in the hotel’s sub-basement, where the city’s steam pipes groaned like dying
  beasts, Dante and Kael hunkered down to map their descent. The Siphon had retreated
  to the Hollow, a pocket dimension created by the hotel’s concentrated misery. Kael
  was sharpening a jagged piece of rebar, her movements rhythmic and lethal, but Dante
  was busy with a different kind of preparation. He laid out his tools: the white
  charcoal, a canister of silver spray paint, and a crumpled photograph of his sister,
  Elena. "The Siphon doesn''t just kill," Kael warned, her voice dropping an octave
  as the shadows around them seemed to lengthen. "He feeds on the ''what-ifs.'' He’ll
  find the thing that rots you from the inside and turn it into a cage. If you''re
  carrying a heavy heart, he’ll make it a literal anchor."


  Dante stared at Elena’s smiling face in the photo. The guilt was a familiar, suffocating
  shroud. He’d spent years wondering if he could have saved her if he hadn''t been
  chasing his own high that night. Now, that guilt wasn''t just a memory; it was a
  tactical weakness. "I know," Dante said, his voice raspy. "I let her go. I wasn''t
  there when her light went out because I was looking for my own." He began to coat
  his hands in the silver paint, a ritualistic barrier meant to keep his own essence
  from leaking out. But as they approached the heavy, rusted iron door that led to
  the hotel’s heart, a paralyzing fear gripped him. The air beyond the door was a
  vacuum, stripped of all color and emotion. It felt exactly like the numbness he
  used to crave—the terrifying, peaceful void of an overdose. To enter was to risk
  relapsing into that nothingness. He looked at Kael, saw the flicker of doubt in
  her eyes, and forced his hand onto the frozen handle. He wasn''t just crossing a
  physical threshold; he was stepping into the center of his own wreckage.


  The Siphon was a towering, shifting mass of stolen hues, a kaleidoscope of the people
  he had emptied. As Dante and Kael entered the boiler room, the killer didn''t strike
  with force; he struck with the past. The room dissolved. Suddenly, Dante wasn''t
  in the Buckingham; he was in a cold, dim apartment on 24th Street. Elena lay on
  the couch, her breath hitching, while a younger, frantic Dante searched for a phone
  he’d already pawned. "You chose the needle over her," the Siphon’s voice echoed,
  a distorted chorus of his victims. "Why fight for a world that reminds you of what
  you destroyed?" Black sludge—the physical manifestation of Dante’s shame—began to
  pour from the walls, rising to his chest. Kael was screaming somewhere in the distance,
  her kinetic energy being sucked into the Siphon’s vortex. Dante felt his vision
  go gray. The old urge to simply sink, to let the darkness take the responsibility
  of breathing away, was an almost irresistible siren song. He was dying a symbolic
  death, his spirit dissolving into the very addiction he thought he’d conquered.


  But then, his fingers brushed the white charcoal pencil in his pocket—the tool that
  revealed the truth. He realized the Siphon’s power relied on Dante’s rejection of
  his pain. The monster fed on the gap between who Dante was and who he wished he
  had been. "I failed her," Dante shouted, not in a plea, but in a declaration that
  cracked the illusion. He didn''t fight the sludge; he reached into it. "I am a thief,
  a liar, and a failure. And I will carry that forever." He lunged forward, not to
  strike the Siphon, but to use the white charcoal to draw a single, perfect line
  across the monster’s chest. The Clarification lead reacted with the stolen energy,
  grounding the Siphon to the reality of Dante’s absolute, unvarnished truth. The
  monster couldn''t digest the weight of a man who finally accepted his own brokenness.
  The Siphon shrieked as the stolen colors erupted from his form, a prismatic explosion
  that leveled the room. Dante stood amidst the swirling light, his guilt no longer
  a cage, but a foundation. He hadn''t won through strength, but through the terrifying
  honesty of his own survival.'
