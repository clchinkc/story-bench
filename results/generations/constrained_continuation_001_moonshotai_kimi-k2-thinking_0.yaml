output: 'The passage Tomás found was a crack in the limestone wall, barely wide enough
  for a person. Zara slipped through first, her thief''s instincts measuring the space
  with practiced ease. Tomás followed, his breath ragged. Behind them, scorpion-marked
  cloaks swarmed the entrance, but the crack was too narrow for pursuit.


  "They''ll find another way," Zara whispered, pressing forward into oppressive darkness.
  The tunnel sloped downward, the air growing thick with moisture and the smell of
  old paper.


  "Twenty years ago, I was a curator at the Library," Tomás said, his voice echoing
  off damp stone. "Before they cast me out for reading forbidden texts. The map you
  stole—it wasn''t just a path. It was my redemption."


  "Redemption how?" Zara''s hand stayed on her knife.


  "The Library holds more than knowledge. It holds memories. Every scholar who studies
  there leaves a piece of themselves behind. I need to... reclaim something I lost."


  Before Zara could press him, the tunnel opened into a vast chamber. A bridge of
  rotting rope and wooden planks spanned a chasm of absolute darkness, and on the
  other side, a massive door marked with the symbol of a sunken ship. The bridge was
  the only way across.


  "This is the first test," Tomás said. "The Bridge of False Leads. Step on the wrong
  plank and the whole thing collapses."


  A rumble shook the chamber. Behind them, the Scorpion Guild had found another entrance.
  Their leader, a tall woman with a golden scorpion pin, emerged with a dozen enforcers.
  "The map was ours, thief. Hand it over, and we''ll make your death quick."


  Zara looked at the bridge. Her thief''s eye caught the pattern—the planks that were
  newer, clumsily replaced. The Guild would cross carefully, testing each step. But
  she didn''t have that luxury.


  "Go," she told Tomás. "I''ll hold them."


  "You can''t fight them all—"


  "I can." She drew her knife, the weight familiar in her hand. "But I need you to
  tell me the truth. What did you really lose in that Library?"


  Tomás''s face crumpled, the scholar''s composure shattering. "My daughter. She fell
  ill while I was studying. I thought I could read my way back to her, find some forbidden
  ritual to undo death itself. The Library promised it could be done. But it was a
  lie. I''ve spent ten years trying to find proof it wasn''t."


  Zara stared at him. This wasn''t about redemption. It was about a father''s grief,
  a desperate hope that had curdled into obsession.


  The Guild advanced, spreading across the chamber.


  Zara made her choice. She grabbed Tomás and shoved him toward the bridge. "Cross!
  Now!"


  She followed, not testing the planks but *feeling* them—her thief''s instincts screaming
  warnings. The third plank groaned beneath her boot. The fifth splintered. She leaped,
  landing on the seventh, then the tenth. Behind her, the Guild leader stepped confidently
  onto the third. The rope snapped. The woman''s scream echoed, then faded into the
  abyss.


  They reached the other side, breathless. Tomás collapsed against the door, weeping
  openly. "I couldn''t save her. I failed her."


  Zara understood. This was the Ordeal—not the bridge, but the moment of truth. She''d
  spent her whole life stealing to save her mother, believing that if she just found
  the right thing, she could fix everything. But some things couldn''t be fixed. Only
  carried.


  She put a hand on Tomás''s shoulder. "We don''t get to undo our failures. We just
  get to keep going."


  The door opened. Not into the Library, but into a circular vault of mirrors—each
  showing a moment of failure. Zara saw herself: a child watching her mother grow
  weak, unable to stop it. Tomás saw himself: holding his daughter''s hand as she
  slipped away.


  The mirrors shattered, raining glass. They emerged into a stone chamber, the true
  Approach. The air thrummed with ancient potential.


  Tomás looked at her, something broken and remade in his eyes. "Thank you."


  Zara nodded. She felt different—lighter, though the weight of her mission remained.
  She''d crossed the bridge of her own fear: that her mother''s death would mean she''d
  failed as a daughter.


  But the Scorpion Guild had found the main entrance. She could hear their boots in
  the chamber above. And the map—the real map—was dissolving in her vest, a trick
  of disappearing ink she''d missed in the chaos.


  They were trapped between the Guild and the Library''s final guardian, with no clear
  way forward. '
