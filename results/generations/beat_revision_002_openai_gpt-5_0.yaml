output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community

  center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property developer
  had

  won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  She didn’t step closer. “I already tried. The fundraiser platform froze our account
  this morning—someone flagged the campaign because I moved money to cover payroll.
  The grant came back denied at noon. And the board… they resigned over the audit.
  They don’t want their names on this.”


  “I don’t—why didn’t you tell me?”


  “I thought I could fix it,” she said, eyes sliding away. “I also… took the developer’s
  offer. They needed a community liaison. It starts next week. They said keeping me
  on would ‘smooth transitions.’”


  He rubbed his temples.


  Down the hall, maintenance carts rattled; the city had sent crews early to “assist.”
  A man in a neon vest unbolted the trophy case; another rolled paint over the kids’
  mural, erasing handprints one swath at a time. A cracked frame clinked in the trash—Jamal’s
  team photo, the first kid Marcus had coached, the one they’d hung in the lobby after
  his accident. The whiff of fresh primer stung his nose.


  His phone buzzed—voicemail. His wife’s voice, flat with exhaustion: “I’m taking
  Maya to my sister’s for a while. We can’t keep floating this. Call when you’ve…
  I can’t do this, Marcus.” The message ended without a goodbye.


  “Keys?” the head custodian asked from the doorway, not meeting his eyes. “They’re
  changing the alarm codes tonight.”


  Denise set her lanyard on the desk between them. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, already
  backing toward the hall, already gone.


  He stared at the notice again until the words blurred. No board. No money. No place.
  The empty gym swallowed his breath, and the center—their center—was already being
  taken apart around him. There was nothing left to call, no one left to call. Only
  the echo.'
