output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car, the engine idling in the pickup lane.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway, merging into
  the stream of red taillights.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly." Sophie''s phone buzzed in her pocket—Linda''s
  name flashing on screen, no doubt about the Pearson account emergencies. Three messages
  already, probably more behind them. Her thumb hovered over the screen, muscle memory
  urging her to tap and scroll. But she paused, remembering the monks'' teaching:
  respond, don''t react. The breath before action. She slipped the phone back into
  her bag, unopened. "I''m still learning how to carry it with me."


  "Carry what?" her mother asked, glancing over with concern.


  "The quiet. It''s harder than I expected." Sophie watched the highway signs blur
  past. "All those emails will still be there tomorrow. The emergencies will wait.
  They always do."


  Her mother smiled slightly. "That''s new."


  They drove in silence for a while. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through
  the evening haze, the Willis Tower''s lights winking against the darkening sky.
  Sophie''s apartment building, a gray rectangle she''d always found nondescript.
  The coffee shop where she bought her morning latte, its neon sign buzzing. Everything
  exactly as she''d left it, yet somehow different—sharper, more precious, as if seen
  through clarified vision.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, and for the first time in years, she meant the
  words fully, without already living in tomorrow''s to-do list. The city felt like
  a place she could inhabit, rather than a stage for constant performance. '
