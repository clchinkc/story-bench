output: 'Priya snapped a fresh sheet of butcher paper onto the service window and
  scribbled in fat marker: TODAY’S SPECIAL: “DISASTER” PANEER BRISKET TACOS—IF YOU
  HATE IT, DEV WILL APOLOGIZE.


  Dev blinked. “I will?”


  “You’ve got the most apologetic face,” she said, already tossing paneer cubes onto
  the flat-top. They hit with a loud, satisfying hiss, and she brushed them with a
  smoky masala glaze that smelled like backyard cookouts and her grandmother’s kitchen
  collided in the best way.


  A couple on scooters rolled up, drawn by the scent and the neon-pink bus. The girl
  read the sign out loud, laughed, and pulled out her phone. “Say it again,” she told
  Dev, camera pointed.


  Dev leaned into the window like a late-night host. “Welcome to the disaster,” he
  said solemnly. “I am Dev, your apology specialist.”


  Priya slid the first taco across, topped with pickled red onions and a drizzle of
  jalapeño raita. The girl took one bite, eyes widening, then shoved the phone closer
  to her face. “This is…this is insane.”


  She panned to Priya, who was already flipping paneer like it owed her money. Priya
  looked straight into the lens and said, “Tell the internet we’re not sorry.”


  The clip was up before they’d even wiped the counter. Ten minutes later, a trickle
  of curious pedestrians became a line that wrapped around the empty lot, and then
  kept going as if it had momentum.


  Dev’s phone buzzed nonstop. “Uh,” he said, voice pitched higher than usual. “We’re
  on TikTok. The same blogger who called us a disaster just reposted it with ‘I TAKE
  IT BACK’ in all caps.”


  Priya’s grin tightened. “Okay. No time to celebrate. You’re on orders, I’m on heat.
  Call out tickets.”


  Dev grabbed a Sharpie and started marking tortillas stacks like a battlefield map.
  “Two Disaster tacos, one no onion, one extra raita. Three brisket-paneer bowls—wait,
  we have bowls?”


  “We have bowls now,” Priya said, yanking a sleeve of compostables from under the
  counter like she’d planned it all along.


  They moved in a rhythm they hadn’t found in three weeks of arguing over permits.
  Dev slid tickets along the rail, kept the Venmo line moving, and shouted warnings—“Hot
  behind!”—like he’d been born inside a food truck. Priya’s hands blurred: sear, chop,
  toss, taste, adjust. When the raita bottle clogged, Dev stabbed the nozzle with
  a toothpick without being asked. When the paneer started browning too fast, Priya
  dialed the heat down with her elbow while plating with her other hand.


  In a rare lull—meaning only three people waiting instead of thirty—Dev leaned against
  the prep table, sweat shining on his forehead. “You’re…really good at this,” he
  said quietly, like he didn’t want the words to jinx anything.


  Priya let herself breathe. “So are you,” she replied. “I couldn’t do this part.
  The talking. The math. The not-panicking.”


  Dev gave a short, incredulous laugh. “I’m absolutely panicking. I’m just doing it
  in spreadsheets.”


  Their shared look wasn’t soft, exactly—more like two climbers realizing they’d clipped
  into the same rope.


  A low horn blared, and a matte-black trailer rolled into the lot next door like
  it owned the street. Bold white letters on the side read: BUCKHORN BBQ—THREE-TIME
  CHAMPS. A man in a crisp apron stepped out, surveying Priya’s line with narrowed
  eyes.


  “New kids,” he called, loud enough for customers to hear. “Fusion, huh? Brave.”


  Dev muttered, “That’s Mason Rourke. He’s…kind of a legend.”


  Priya wiped her hands on her apron and called back, bright as a knife, “Come try
  one, Mason. I’ll apologize if you hate it.”


  Mason smirked, then glanced at her window where the line kept growing. “No refunds
  at my place,” he said. “We’ll see how long your internet fame lasts.”


  By sundown they’d sold out of paneer twice, sent Dev sprinting to a corner store
  for emergency yogurt, and taped a handwritten SOLD OUT to the window to a chorus
  of groans and laughter. Someone started chanting, “Dis-as-ter! Dis-as-ter!” like
  it was a football game.


  Priya’s phone buzzed again. This time it was an email with an official logo: AUSTIN
  FOOD TRUCK CHAMPIONSHIP—INVITATION TO QUALIFIER. She read it once, then twice, feeling
  her pulse kick.


  Dev leaned in, eyes scanning fast. “Priya,” he said, voice cracking with excitement.
  “We’re in. We’re actually in.”


  She laughed, sharp and disbelieving, and for one full second the bus, the line,
  the noise all fell away. “We did it,” she said. “We—”


  Dev’s smile faltered as he scrolled. “Wait. There’s a compliance note.” He turned
  the screen toward her. “Mandatory surprise health inspection before the qualifier.
  Proof of commissary agreement and fire suppression certification required.”


  Priya’s stomach dipped, because the school bus had passed a lot of things on charm
  and late-night YouTube tutorials, and their commissary paperwork was still…in progress.


  Across the lot, Mason’s black trailer lights flicked on, clean and steady, as if
  to underline the difference.


  Dev swallowed. “We can fix this,” he said, more promise than fact.


  Priya squared her shoulders, the email glowing between them like a trophy and a
  warning. “Then we fix it,” she said, and the stakes snapped into place.'
