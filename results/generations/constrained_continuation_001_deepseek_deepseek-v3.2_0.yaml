output: 'Tomás pulled her into a crevice hidden behind a tapestry of faded silks.
  The clamor of the market faded, replaced by the drip of water and their ragged breaths.
  The passage narrowed, walls slick with moss, descending into deeper darkness. Tomás
  produced a small glowstone, casting eerie shadows. “The Approach is riddled with
  old traps,” he whispered. “Step where I step.”


  They moved slowly, Zara’s thief instincts alert. She spotted the subtle discrepancy
  first—a floor tile slightly raised. “Wait,” she hissed, pulling Tomás back. Crouching,
  she traced the edges, feeling for mechanisms. With careful pressure from her knife,
  she disarmed a pressure plate that would have sent poisoned darts flying. Tomás
  exhaled shakily. “Your skills are our salvation.”


  Deeper in, a sudden rumble echoed. From a side tunnel, Scorpion Guild enforcers
  emerged, cutting off their retreat. Tomás urged her forward toward a stone archway.
  “Through there! It leads to a chasm bridge!” But as they sprinted, a hidden net
  snapped up from the floor, ensnaring Tomás. He cried out, tangled and struggling.
  Zara skidded to a halt, free and clear. The enforcers were closing in; she could
  make it alone, sacrifice him for speed. Her mother’s face flashed in her mind—time
  was bleeding away. But Tomás had trusted her. Gritting her teeth, she slashed at
  the ropes with her knife, her hands swift from years of picking locks and cutting
  purses. She freed him just as the first enforcer lunged; they tumbled through the
  archway together, sealing it with a crumbling lever.


  On the other side, a narrow bridge spanned a black abyss. Wind howled up from the
  depths. Tomás leaned against the wall, breathing hard. “I owe you my life,” he said,
  voice thick. “You should know why I’m really here. The Library… it holds records
  of my family’s disgrace. My father was accused of heresy for studying there. I need
  to clear his name, not just guide you.” Zara nodded, the revelation settling heavily.
  Everyone had their ghosts.


  Crossing the bridge became the Ordeal. Halfway, ancient mechanisms groaned, and
  the structure began to collapse. Stones fell into the void. Zara’s foot slipped;
  she clung to a rope, dangling over nothingness. Below, the darkness yawned like
  failure—not just death, but the end of her quest, her mother doomed because she
  wasn’t clever or strong enough. Fear choked her. She imagined returning empty-handed,
  watching her mother fade. But then she saw Tomás reaching, his face desperate with
  his own need. With a scream of effort, she swung herself to solid footing, pulling
  him up as the bridge gave way behind them. In that moment, she felt a part of herself
  die—the girl who doubted, who feared inadequacy—and from the ashes rose a hardened
  resolve. She would not fail.


  They collapsed on a stable ledge, the way forward now a steep climb. Zara’s hands
  were raw, but her mind was clear, focused. She had faced the abyss and chosen to
  fight. Tomás pointed upward where a faint light outlined a massive door—the entrance
  to the Sunken Library. But as they caught their breath, a new sound echoed: the
  scrape of claws on stone from the shadows above, and a low, hungry growl. Something
  ancient and vigilant awaited them.'
