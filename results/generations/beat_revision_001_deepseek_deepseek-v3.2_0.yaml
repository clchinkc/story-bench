output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands.

  The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes, exactly
  as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. Its voice was not a threat, but
  a cold, knowing truth. "I did not kill your brother. Your failure did."


  The words struck deeper than any claw. The memory she carried as a torch of vengeance
  crumbled into ash, revealing the guilt she had buried. She saw it again—her hesitation,
  her brother shoving her aside, the raiders’ swords.


  "His blood is on your hands, not my scales," the dragon hissed, its eyes reflecting
  her shattered face.


  Kira’s sword arm dropped. The fight drained from her, leaving a hollow shell. This
  was the true enemy, and she was already defeated. She sank to her knees, not from
  a blow, but from the crushing weight of the truth. This was her death—not of the
  body, but of the hero she thought she was.


  In that void, a final, quiet thought emerged. Her brother had chosen her life. To
  die here in guilt was to spit on that gift.


  The dragon lunged, seeing her surrender. But Kira did not see a monster. She saw
  a mirror of her own despair, and she refused to let it be the last thing she saw.


  She did not rise with a battle cry, but with a whispered oath. "I will live with
  it."


  As obsidian claws descended, she moved not away, but into the strike, her body a
  vessel for a will newly forged. Her sword found the gap not through strength, but
  through perfect, accepting clarity. She drove it home.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  the old Kira gone. The guilt remained, but it was no longer a chain. It was a weight
  she knew how to carry.


  "I did it," she whispered, not in triumph, but in solemn recognition. She retrieved
  her sword, its balance unfamiliar in her changed hands, and began the long walk
  back.'
