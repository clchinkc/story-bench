output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car. The air was cooler than Bangkok, a sharp reminder of reality.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly." Sophie pulled her phone from her
  pocket, the screen lighting up with a flood of notifications. She scanned the list:
  three emergencies, a flagged message from Linda. "Oh, great. Linda needs me to call
  her tonight about the Pearson account."


  "Can''t it wait until morning?"


  Sophie’s thumb hovered over the screen, the old reflex to fix everything immediately
  flaring up. She remembered the silence of the retreat, the breath she had learned
  to take before reacting. "You know how it is," she said softly, but instead of typing
  a reply, she clicked the power button, darkening the screen. "The Pearson account
  won''t manage itself, but neither will I. It can wait."


  They drove in silence for a while. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through
  the evening haze, jagged and imposing against the purple sky. Sophie''s apartment
  building rose in the distance. The coffee shop where she bought her morning latte.
  Everything exactly as she''d left it, yet it seemed smaller somehow, less overwhelming.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, looking out the window rather than at the dark
  phone in her hand.'
