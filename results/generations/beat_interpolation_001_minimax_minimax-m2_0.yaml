output: 'Elena stood before Marcus’s curiosity shop as the first pale light washed
  the street. The brass nameplate read “Marcus, Purveyor of Odd and Otherwise,” and
  the bell over the door chimed with a sound like tiny bells tolling in a breeze.
  The night’s chill still clung to her coat, and the memory of the map’s glow throbbed
  behind her eyes. She’d meant to walk past without stopping, but the door swung open
  before she reached it.


  Marcus smiled, lines deepening around eyes that had seen too many strange things.
  “You look like someone who slept on a fence and woke up with splinters,” he said.
  “Come in. Tea’s on.”


  Inside, the shop smelled of leather and dust, of paper that had outlived its authors.
  Shelves sagged under jars of seeds, polished stones, brass instruments with mysterious
  dials, and stacks of maps so old they looked like they might crumble at a breath.
  In the corner sat the brass compass on the counter, its needle already spinning.


  “The map woke you last night,” he said, pouring from a kettle that hissed like a
  cat. “It wakes people it wants. Most folks run. You stood in your grandmother’s
  kitchen and made your choice.”


  “I chose to run,” Elena said, wrapping her fingers around the warm mug. “I’m a librarian.
  I catalog books, make tea, and lose my place in conversations. I don’t trek through
  enchanted forests.”


  Marcus leaned on the counter, voice gentle. “That’s not small work. You notice things
  others miss—marks, patterns, the way a story leans when it’s told wrong. The Thornwood
  tests intentions, not sword arms. Your eyes can see what others ignore, your mind
  can hold the order of chaos. Those are tools.”


  He slid the compass toward her. “It won’t tell you north, but it will tell you true.
  And this.” He lifted a leather satchel, worn smooth. “A place for the useful, a
  place for the precious, a place for what you think you’ll never need but might.
  I won’t walk with you. I can’t. But I can send you equipped.”


  Elena turned the compass in her palm, feeling the weight of its certainty. “You
  know the map’s path?”


  “I know enough,” he said. “Maps choose their readers. Your grandmother knew that.
  She trusted you.”


  The mug warmed her hands, and something in her chest loosened, just enough to let
  breath in. Not courage, not yet—more like a decision reluctantly acknowledged. She
  could still refuse. She could still go home and bury her head in cataloging and
  tea. But the compass sat heavy and right, and Marcus stood as a witness, not a rescuer.
  She straightened, the satchel strap settling across her shoulder.


  “If I stumble,” she said, “it’s not because I’m useless.”


  Marcus nodded, pleased. “You won’t.” He tapped the map she hadn’t brought but somehow
  knew he could see. “You’ll go because you can read the world better than most. You’ll
  go because ordinary can be a blade, sharp and honest. And you’ll go because the
  forest will test who you are, not what you pretend to be.”


  Elena stepped back into the street, the compass humming softly, the satchel snug
  against her hip. Dawn was spilling gold across the roofs now, and the Thornwood
  waited beyond the last streetlamp. She didn’t feel like a hero. She felt like someone
  being quietly, stubbornly invited. It would have to be enough.'
