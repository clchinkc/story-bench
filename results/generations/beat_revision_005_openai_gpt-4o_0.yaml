  The segment effectively captures the "Dark Night of the Soul" beat. It follows the
  "All Is Lost" moment with the closure of the gallery, a major defeat for Maya. She
  is alone in her dark apartment, feeling isolated and engulfed in genuine despair
  as she reflects on her failure to fulfill her promise to her deceased mother. The
  narrative captures her vulnerability and includes a "whiff of death" through her
  memories of her mother''s last days. There are no solutions presented, only the
  weight of her loss, aligning perfectly with the intended beat.'
