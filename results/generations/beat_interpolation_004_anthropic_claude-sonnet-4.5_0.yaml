output: 'Thomas stood, his mind racing. He could see it playing out—ask the wrong
  question, and Dr. Okonkwo would lie. Ask nothing, and he''d lose everything his
  father had taught him to value.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," he began, his voice steady despite the earthquake in his chest. "How
  many adverse reactions did Meridian''s trial data show for Compound X-7?"


  She opened her mouth. Closed it. Her hands trembled on the witness stand rail. "I...
  the official reports indicated—"


  "Not what the official reports said. What did the data show?"


  A long pause. Thomas could feel his father''s eyes burning into his back. The defense
  attorney was already half-standing, ready to object, sensing victory.


  Dr. Okonkwo''s voice came out barely above a whisper. "Forty-three serious adverse
  reactions in the first six months."


  "And how many did Meridian report to the FDA?"


  "Seven."


  The gallery stirred. Thomas pressed forward. "Dr. Okonkwo, did you personally recommend
  halting the trial in June 2019?"


  Her eyes filled with tears. "I..." She looked at the defense table. At her husband
  in the gallery. "I don''t recall making that—"


  Thomas made his choice. He broke every rule he''d learned.


  "Your daughter is six years old," he said quietly. "Same age as Katie Henderson
  was when Meridian''s drug stopped her heart."


  "Mr. Wright!" The defense attorney shot up. "Objection! Counsel is testifying, badgering
  the witness—"


  "Sustained," the judge said, but Thomas didn''t stop.


  "They''re offering you hope for her life in exchange for your silence about seventeen
  deaths. Is that correct?"


  Dr. Okonkwo was crying now. The judge was banging his gavel. The defense was shouting.
  But Thomas held her gaze.


  "I can''t help your daughter if you lie," he said, voice cutting through the chaos.
  "But I can try to help her if you tell the truth. That''s my promise. Not a deal.
  A promise."


  The courtroom went silent.


  Dr. Okonkwo straightened in her chair. Wiped her eyes. When she spoke again, her
  voice was clear.


  "Yes. I recommended halting the trial. I documented thirty-six deaths the company
  attributed to other causes. I have the original data files. All of it." She looked
  directly at Meridian''s CEO. "All of it."


  Thomas exhaled. His father''s principle had held. Justice wasn''t negotiable.


  "No further questions," he said.'
