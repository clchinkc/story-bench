output: "Thomas gripped the edge of the lectern, his knuckles bleaching white as he\
  \ stared at the trembling hands folded in Dr. Okonkwo’s lap. The courtroom’s air\
  \ conditioning hummed too loud in the silence that followed her affirmation to tell\
  \ the truth.  \n\n“You were the head of clinical research at Meridian for twelve\
  \ years,” he began, keeping his voice even, “during which time you oversaw the trials\
  \ for Neurozyme—the drug the prosecution alleges caused seventeen preventable deaths.”\
  \  \n\n“Yes.” Her voice cracked. A bead of sweat traced her temple.  \n\n“Did you\
  \ bury adverse reaction reports from Phase III trials?”  \n\n“I—I reviewed all data\
  \ submitted to the FDA.” She blinked rapidly, her gaze flicking to the defense table.\
  \ The CEO’s smirk widened.  \n\nThomas stepped closer, his next words deliberate:\
  \ “Would you identify Exhibit 22-B? A memo from Dr. Carla Mendoza, dated March 14,\
  \ 2021, detailing fatal neurological complications in Neurozyme test subjects?”\
  \  \n\nShe hesitated. “I… don’t recall this document.”  \n\nThe lie hung in the\
  \ air. A juror shifted audibly. Thomas felt his father’s eyes bore into his back\
  \ like a physical weight.  \n\n“You *authored* the memo, Dr. Okonkwo,” he pressed,\
  \ pulling a folder from his table. “This copy was recovered from your personal email\
  \ server, timestamped the morning after your daughter’s diagnosis.”  \n\nHer breath\
  \ hitched. “They said… if I cooperated, they’d fast-track her treatment. That it\
  \ would be *different* this time, that—”  \n\n“Objection!” The defense lawyer rose.\
  \ “Speculation about private negotiations.”  \n\nThomas turned, palms splayed on\
  \ the witness rail. “Your Honor, the defense has spent this trial questioning my\
  \ *morality* while burying victims who trusted their doctors. Now we see why.” \
  \ \n\nThe judge rapped his gavel. “Answer the question, Dr. Okonkwo.”  \n\nFor the\
  \ first time, she looked directly at Thomas—a raw, pleading gaze. He dropped his\
  \ voice. “My father’s got ALS. Same disease your daughter has. You think he’d want\
  \ a cure built on corpses?”  \n\nA sob tore from her throat. “No. God, no.”  \n\n\
  “Then show them their faces.” He slid the photograph across the rail—the seventeen\
  \ victims, smiling, framed in a single printed collage.  \n\nShe traced the edges,\
  \ shoulders shaking. When she spoke, it was to the defense. “You told me Meridian’s\
  \ lawyers could make the charges disappear. But you lied. You’d have let those children\
  \ die twice—once in the trials, once in the court record.” Her voice steadied. “I’ve\
  \ submitted the full data set to the court’s independent expert. The unredacted\
  \ files are in my personal cloud.”  \n\nThe CEO’s chair screeched as he shot to\
  \ his feet. The judge silenced him with a glare.  \n\nThomas exhaled. The die was\
  \ cast. Truth wouldn’t resurrect the dead—but it would bury the liars."
