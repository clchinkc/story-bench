output: 'Three months into her tenure, the silence of the villa usually felt oppressive,
  but tonight the kitchen was warm with the scent of cinnamon and lemon zest. Maya
  stirred the *arroz con leche*, watching the steam rise. It was peasant food—hardly
  fit for a millionaire’s strict diet plan—but she needed the comfort of her grandmother’s
  recipe.


  She didn''t hear him enter. One moment she was alone; the next, Alejandro was leaning
  against the doorframe. He wasn''t wearing his usual armor of tailored suits and
  indifference. In a worn grey t-shirt, leaning heavily on his bad leg, he looked
  less like a soccer legend and more like a man in pain.


  "My mother used to make that," he said, his voice rough with sleep.


  Maya froze, spoon suspended. In ninety days, he had spoken to her only to critique
  salt levels or schedule meals. "It''s almost ready. Would you like a bowl?"


  He hesitated, looking at the pot with a hunger that had nothing to do with food.
  "I shouldn''t. The carbs..."


  "You''re retired, Alejandro. You''re allowed to eat rice pudding at two in the morning."
  She ladled a portion into a ceramic bowl and dusted it with cinnamon, sliding it
  across the marble island.


  He took a bite, closing his eyes. The tension that permanently lined his forehead
  smoothed out. "It tastes like Sundays in Seville," he murmured. "Before the leagues.
  Before the cameras." He looked up, and for the first time, the steel wall behind
  his eyes was gone. "I haven''t been back there in ten years. They don''t let you
  just be a person anymore. You become a commodity."


  "Here, you''re just a person who likes pudding," Maya said softly.


  He laughed—a rusty, genuine sound that seemed to startle them both. He ate the rest
  in silence, not the cold silence of the first weeks, but a companionable quiet.
  When he finished, he didn''t leave immediately. He watched her wipe the counter,
  his gaze thoughtful.


  "Thank you, Maya. Not just for the food."


  "It''s my job."


  "No," he said, his dark eyes locking onto hers. "Lucia hires people to do a job.
  You make this place feel like a home."


  As he walked away, the sound of his limp echoing down the hall, Maya looked at the
  empty bowl. The debt, the restaurant, the salary—they suddenly felt secondary. She
  wasn''t just guarding a paycheck anymore; she was guarding him.'
