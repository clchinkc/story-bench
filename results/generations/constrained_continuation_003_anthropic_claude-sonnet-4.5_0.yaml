output: 'Processing turned out to mean standing in a grimy corridor with sixty other
  arrivals while a bored official scanned their credentials. The Free Orbital Collective
  wasn''t what Jin had imagined—not gleaming stations of enlightened independence,
  but cramped modules stitched together with desperation and defiance. The air tasted
  recycled, metallic.


  "First time?" A woman in her fifties approached, salt-and-pepper hair cropped short.
  "You''ve got that Earth-gravity walk. Takes weeks to adjust." She extended her hand.
  "Dr. Nasrin Ahmadi. I coordinate the Research Commons."


  Jin recognized the name. Ahmadi had left the European Space Agency after exposing
  budget fraud. "Jin Park. I—"


  "I know who you are. Everyone does." She gestured for him to follow. "News travels
  fast up here, especially when it''s about someone who pissed off the whole planet."


  The Collective''s political structure bewildered him. No central authority, just
  overlapping councils that formed and dissolved based on immediate needs. Ahmadi
  explained while leading him through pressurized tunnels connecting habitation modules:
  three factions perpetually negotiating, each with different visions. The Pragmatists
  wanted reconciliation with Earth. The Absolutists demanded total separation. The
  Synthesists, Ahmadi''s group, believed in selective engagement—sharing knowledge
  while maintaining sovereignty.


  "You''ll need to declare alignment," Ahmadi said. "Housing, work assignments, even
  food rations flow through faction channels."


  "I just need somewhere safe to—"


  "There is no ''just somewhere safe'' here. Everything is political. Even breathing."
  She stopped at a viewport overlooking a construction site where workers were assembling
  solar arrays. "We survive because we''re useful. The moment we stop being worth
  more alive than dead, Earth''s patience ends."


  She got him temporary quarters and access to the Research Commons, a collaborative
  workspace where scientists from various factions shared equipment. Jin spent three
  days searching for his footing, attending faction meetings, trying to understand
  the ecosystem. The Synthesists seemed closest to his goals—they wanted to keep fighting
  for Earth''s future, just from beyond its reach.


  Then Ahmadi showed him something that changed everything.


  "Your carbon capture technology," she said, pulling up encrypted files in a private
  lab. "We''ve been analyzing the data you leaked. There''s something the Council
  didn''t just suppress—they actively altered your results."


  Jin''s stomach dropped. "What do you mean?"


  "The process works, but not how your research suggested. It''s more efficient than
  you documented—radically so. By orders of magnitude." She displayed comparative
  models. "Someone on your team, possibly multiple people, deliberately understated
  the effectiveness. Made it look promising enough to leak, but not revolutionary
  enough to seem… dangerous."


  "Yuna." Jin''s mind raced. "She compiled the final datasets."


  "Either she was working for the Council, feeding you compromised information to
  discredit the leak, or—" Ahmadi paused. "The real data is worse somehow. Worse for
  someone."


  Jin found what he needed in those files: proof more explosive than his original
  leak, and a platform to share it. The Synthesists would broadcast it. He could expose
  not just the suppression but the manipulation. Continue the fight.


  But Ahmadi made the cost clear. "Broadcasting this means declaring the Collective
  officially hostile to Earth interests. The Pragmatists will abandon us. Supply lines
  from surface companies will close. We''ll be in open conflict."


  "People are dying down there because—"


  "People are dying up here too, slowly, because we depend on Earth for supplies we
  can''t manufacture yet." Ahmadi''s expression was hard. "I''m not saying don''t
  do it. I''m saying know the price. Dozens of stations will suffer."


  Jin thought of his parents, unreachable now. Of Yuna''s possible betrayal. Of the
  abstract masses suffering from climate collapse versus the concrete faces around
  him—fellow exiles who''d built fragile sanctuary.


  He authorized the broadcast.


  Within an hour, Earth''s corporations began canceling contracts. The Pragmatist
  faction issued furious condemnations. Ahmadi stood beside him as the backlash mounted,
  her hand steady on his shoulder.


  "Welcome to the Collective," she said quietly. "Where every truth costs someone
  everything."'
