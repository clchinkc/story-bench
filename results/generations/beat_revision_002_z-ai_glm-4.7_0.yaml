output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out. It wasn''t just a building; it
  was the only safe haven these kids had.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director, her
  voice trembling.


  "There isn''t, Denise." Marcus slumped into his chair, the weight of it crushing
  his spine. "The fundraiser venue cancelled this morning. The developer bought the
  building out from under us. We have no way to raise the cash."


  "But what about the grant? We should hear back next week. If that comes through..."


  His phone buzzed on the desk, a harsh mechanical rattle in the quiet room. He didn''t
  want to look, but his eyes drifted to the screen. An email notification. *Final
  Decision: Application Denied.* The funding committee had dissolved.


  "It''s over," he whispered.


  Denise backed away toward the door, clutching her purse. "I can''t watch this happen,
  Marcus. I have a mortgage. I... I start a new job on Monday." She paused, hand on
  the knob. "I''m sorry." The door clicked shut, leaving him in the empty office.


  He rubbed his temples, trying to massage away the headache splitting his skull.
  His phone buzzed again. A text from his wife: *The bank called again. If you lose
  the center, we lose the house too. I''m taking the kids to my mom''s.*


  Marcus stared at the blank wall. No money, no staff, no center, and now his family
  was walking away. There was no board to call, no miracle left. He was alone in the
  ruin of his life.'
