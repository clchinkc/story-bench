output: 'Eleanor’s gloved fingers tightened on the pages until the paper crinkled.
  The fog pressed closer, beading on the black marble headstones, blurring their names
  into anonymity. Only her father’s inscription remained sharply legible to her eye:
  ARTHUR BLACKWOOD, PRINTER.


  “A true account?” she asked. “Did he mean…investigation? Speculation?”


  Thomas shifted, boots sinking into the sodden ground. “He interviewed people in
  Whitechapel. Witnesses. Constables. Women who knew the victims.” He hesitated. “And
  others who would not give their names at all.”


  “You knew of this?”


  “I set the type for his notes, when he wished them fair-copied. But the narrative
  itself—he kept it locked away. Said it was not yet time.”


  The mist curled around Eleanor’s skirts like cold fingers. True account. Whitechapel.
  The Ripper. The very words were a contagion in polite society, spoken only in drawing
  rooms with shudders and lowered voices. To trade upon them felt like desecration.


  Yet the solicitor’s phrases returned to her with merciless clarity: insurmountable
  debts, foreclosure, auction of the presses. Discharge of employees.


  “What did he hope?” she murmured. “That London’s terror would pay our creditors?”


  Thomas did not flinch. “He believed people would buy the truth. Every paper prints
  rumors and half-truths. He thought a story that felt…closer than the broadsheets
  might command a price.”


  “Closer,” she repeated, tasting the word as though it were bitter ink. “At the expense
  of the dead?”


  “Their names are already sold on every street corner,” he said quietly. “But the
  profits never came to Whitechapel, nor to Blackwood & Sons.”


  Her gaze flicked to him. He stood with his hat in his hands despite the drizzle,
  hair damp, shoulders squared as if expecting a blow.


  “If the firm fails,” he added, more softly, “I have nowhere respectable to go. A
  foreign name is tolerated in a trade, Miss Blackwood, but not invited into gentlemen’s
  offices. My parents would take me back to the laundry. They are not young.”


  So it was not only her father’s legacy at stake. It was Thomas’s future, and that
  of every compositor and ink-stained boy in their employ.


  She looked down at the manuscript. The first pages crackled as she turned them,
  revealing her father’s tight script merged with another, sharper hand—as if someone
  had annotated the margins. Here and there, a word had been struck through and replaced,
  as though facts had shifted beneath his pen. Names of alleys. Times of night. Hints
  at a pattern that the newspapers had missed, or chosen to ignore.


  Halfway in, a slip of paper protruded, not in her father’s hand at all. A single
  sentence, jagged with haste:


  You do not know what nest you are prodding.


  No signature.


  Eleanor remembered, suddenly, the way her father had started at shadows in his final
  weeks, the double locking of doors, the unfamiliar hat once glimpsed hanging by
  the print-shop entrance and gone the next day.


  Profit versus desecration. Safety versus ruin. Silence versus a voice on the printed
  page.


  “Your advice, Mr. Chen,” she said. “As a man of business.”


  He almost smiled at the title, then checked himself. “As a printer, I say the public
  will devour this. As a man—” his gaze went to the grave “—I question whether we
  should make theatre of horror. And as your father’s servant, I must tell you he
  was willing to risk more than his reputation on this work. Perhaps his life.”


  She felt the weight of every sermon she had ever heard on feminine propriety, on
  modesty and quiet endurance. The parson’s wife had already begun to speak to her,
  gently, of suitable matches, of how comfortable it would be to let a husband manage
  such sordid affairs.


  “If I do nothing,” Eleanor said, “Blackwood & Sons dies politely. If I publish,
  we profit from terror and invite it to our door.”


  “We may invite it regardless,” Thomas replied. “The notes name certain gentlemen—magistrates,
  investors—who did not wish their failures recorded. Your father thought fear of
  exposure might force reforms. Others might think to silence us instead.”


  The mist thickened, swallowing the last distant umbrellas. Eleanor drew herself
  up.


  “Then let them know where to find me,” she said. “I will not let my father’s presses
  be broken up and sold for scrap while men who failed these women sit easy.”


  “You mean to publish?” There was no censure in Thomas’s voice now, only the steadiness
  of a man awaiting orders.


  “I do.”


  The word left her mouth and seemed to hang in the damp air, irreversible as ink
  once impressed on paper.


  She closed the manuscript and held it against her chest, as though shielding it—or
  herself—from the chill. Somewhere a bell tolled the hour, each note a nail driven
  into the coffin of her old life: dutiful daughter, decorative presence, silent observer.


  “Then we have three months to make London read,” she said. “We shall serialize it.
  Weekly parts. Begin with the first installment my father marked.”


  Thomas inclined his head. “We will need paper on credit. Ink. Extra compositors,
  if the run is large. And a name. He wrote under ‘A. Gentleman.’”


  “No,” Eleanor said, surprising even herself. “Let them know a woman’s hand is in
  this. Use ‘E. Blackwood.’ Those who care to look may draw their conclusions.”


  The notion was indecent. A lady’s name in print, not for charitable verse or pious
  reflections, but bound to the city’s darkest alleys. Society would whisper. Some
  doors would close forever.


  So be it.


  When they left the cemetery, night had nearly fallen, the gaslamps along Fleet Street
  smearing halos in the fog. The printing house loomed ahead, its brick façade streaked
  with soot, upper windows blank as lidded eyes. Inside, the presses slept, hulking
  shapes beneath tarpaulins.


  Eleanor strode across the echoing floor, the manuscript under her arm. The familiar
  smell of oil, metal, and old ink rose to meet her like a blessing and a warning.


  “Ink the forme,” she told Thomas, her voice carrying in the vastness. “Set the first
  chapter. We run a thousand copies of a prospectus by dawn—an announcement. ‘Coming:
  The Whitechapel Murders—A True Account, by E. Blackwood.’”


  “A thousand?” He blinked, then nodded. “Very well.”


  As he called the men back from their lodgings, as lamps were lit and type-cases
  opened, Eleanor climbed the narrow stair to her father’s office. The door stuck
  for a moment, then yielded with a groan. Inside, the ledgers lay open where he had
  left them, columns of red ink marching toward catastrophe.


  She took up his pen, dipped it, and signed her name beneath the last trembling entry.
  Not as witness, but as proprietor.


  From the alley below, a cart rattled past, then slowed. Hooves halted beside the
  rear door. Eleanor moved to the window and saw nothing through the murk but the
  faint orange glow of a pipe ember, hanging in the air like a watchful eye.


  The ember bobbed once and vanished.


  Her heart beat faster, but she did not call out. Downstairs, the first lines of
  her father’s account were already taking shape in metal: each letter a tiny, irrevocable
  decision.


  Eleanor turned back to the desk and laid the anonymous warning slip beside the manuscript.
  She smoothed it flat with her palm.


  “You do not know what nest you are prodding,” she whispered. “Very well. Let us
  see what flies out.”


  Below, the press gave a testing groan as it was set in motion, iron jaws opening
  to receive the blank sheets that would soon bear her name—and whatever consequences
  that name would summon.'
