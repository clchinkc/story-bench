output: 'Kenji Nakamura stands alone in his corner office, the city beyond the glass
  streaked with rain. His nameplate is gone. His desk is empty. For twenty years he
  built the company from nothing; for ten his wife chose absence over his absences;
  for five his daughter sent birthday cards with no return address. A hostile takeover
  has left him with reputation and severance. He watches Tokyo, and the rain writes
  itself across the window like a ledger of debts.


  The inciting incident arrives in a plain envelope. Yuki’s handwriting is careful,
  like a prayer. She is getting married in a village outside Kyoto. She wants him
  to walk her down the aisle. She knows they do not talk. She knows their mother is
  gone. She does not want to do this alone. He reads it twice, the paper trembling
  faintly in his hands.


  He debates, and the debate is a long room with no door. What right does he have
  now? She is grown; he missed it. He is a stranger at the edge of her life. But the
  company is gone. His apartment feels like a museum of choices he made in silence.
  There is nothing keeping him in Tokyo. He packs a small bag, takes the shinkansen,
  and the first plot point arrives with the train doors closing behind him: he is
  going.


  Kyoto is quieter than Tokyo, the mountains leaning close. The village is narrow
  streets and wooden eaves. Yuki’s fiancé’s family is kind, wary. He meets Haruki
  in a workshop where bamboo is split and smoothed until it sings. Haruki is old and
  patient. He has hands that remember. He offers Kenji tea. They do not speak of business.
  They speak of patience. Haruki shows him how to weave, how to sit, how to measure
  time in generations.


  Kenji tries to reconnect with Yuki. He offers help with wedding preparations and
  is clumsy; he spills ink on a scroll, knots bamboo too tight, laughs too loudly
  at jokes he does not understand. He sleeps better than he has in years. The night
  air smells of cedar and river. He watches the moon over the roof tiles and thinks
  the world is not only meetings and forecasts.


  At the festival, Yuki introduces him to her fiancé’s family. She is graceful, competent,
  loved. For the first time, Kenji sees her as an adult, as someone complete without
  him. He feels a false victory, as if he could slip back into her life, as if a letter
  could erase years. He imagines walking her down the aisle, his name returning to
  a place of honor.


  Old business rivals find him. They call it opportunity. They offer backing for a
  new venture, a chance to rebuild, to win again. The temptation is a bright light.
  He hears the old rhythm of ambition, the promise of noise and motion. Yuki finds
  out about the deal. She looks at him with the same careful handwriting in her eyes.
  “You came for this,” she says. “You always came for this.”


  All is lost. She confronts him, and her words are simple, sharp. “You haven’t changed.
  You’re still choosing ambition over people.” She uninvites him from the wedding.
  The inn room is quiet. He sits on the futon, and the quiet is not peace but a mirror.
  He sees himself, a man who measured life in quarters, who missed birthdays and conversations,
  who built walls and called them progress. He realizes he is not just losing a wedding;
  he is losing the last chance to be a father without conditions.


  The second plot point is a phone call. He declines the deal. He says the words slowly,
  as if each one is a bamboo sliver he must place carefully. He goes to find Yuki,
  not to change her mind, but to apologize without conditions. He finds her in the
  garden behind the inn. The air is cool. She is arranging flowers. He says he is
  sorry. He says he came because she asked. He says he stayed because he should have
  stayed years ago.


  The climax is not a scene in the hall. It is outside the venue. He does not attend
  the wedding. He stands at the edge of the street, watching the lanterns glow, hearing
  laughter spill into the night. After the ceremony, Yuki finds him. “You stayed.”
  “You’re my daughter,” he says. “I should have stayed years ago.” They do not reconcile
  completely, but they begin. She does not invite him back into her life; she allows
  him to stand at the doorway. He accepts it. He stands there and learns patience.


  Denouement. Kenji returns to Tokyo. He rents a small space and opens a bamboo craft
  shop. His apartment is no longer a museum. There are plants, handmade bowls, a photo
  of Yuki on the shelf. He is alone, but no longer empty. He measures time in the
  grain of bamboo, in the sound of split reed, in the quiet of a room where someone
  might visit. Sometimes losing everything is how we find what matters. He has found
  it, quietly, in the space between a letter and a doorway, in the choice to stand
  outside and watch.'
