output: 'Thomas stood, the room tightening around him as he approached the podium.
  Dr. Okonkwo’s gaze slid past him, landing somewhere over his shoulder. He began
  with the basics, her education, her years at Meridian, her role as head of research.
  Each answer came back clipped, professional, almost rehearsed. The documents lay
  in front of her, sealed and waiting, but she kept her hands folded over them as
  if to keep them from speaking.


  He guided her through the early studies, the promising results, the first red flags
  buried in a spreadsheet footnote. She acknowledged the flags, the memos, the suppressed
  safety reports. Then, with the precision of a scalpel, he reached for the heart
  of it—the seventeen deaths that should have been prevented. Her voice faltered.
  She looked toward the defense table, then down at her lap.


  “Dr. Okonkwo,” Thomas said, softer now. “You were the head of research. You signed
  off on the final trial design. Do you stand by that design?”


  “I—” Her throat worked. “I may have been mistaken about some details. The data was
  complex. Sometimes it’s hard to be certain.”


  The room exhaled as one. The defense attorney’s pen stopped mid-scratch. Thomas
  felt his father’s gaze like a weight. He took a breath, then another.


  “Your Honor,” he said, turning to the bench. “I request a brief recess.”


  The judge’s eyes flicked to the gallery, then back to Thomas. “Granted. Ten minutes.”


  The bailiff’s steps echoed as the courtroom emptied. Thomas walked to the witness
  stand, not to cajole or threaten, but to meet the fear head-on. “Dr. Okonkwo,” he
  said, low enough that only she could hear. “My father taught me that justice isn’t
  negotiable. It’s also not indifferent. Your daughter will get the treatment. I’m
  calling Dr. Patel at University Hospital. He’ll place her on the compassionate-use
  list today. It won’t be a guarantee, but it will be a chance.”


  Her eyes snapped to his. “You can’t promise—”


  “I’m not promising,” he said. “I’m telling you what I will do. And I’m telling you
  that your testimony won’t change that. This is about the truth, not a trade. Seventeen
  people are dead because Meridian buried their warnings. Your daughter is alive because
  you chose to speak. I won’t let fear decide that for you.”


  She stared at the documents, then at her hands. “If I say what I know—”


  “Then you say it,” Thomas said. “And we carry what comes.”


  The bailiff called them back. The room settled, thick with waiting. Dr. Okonkwo’s
  fingers found the seal. She broke it. The first page was a log of adverse events,
  dates and outcomes, the kind of detail that made lies crumble. She lifted her chin
  and looked at the jury.


  “I stand by my research,” she said, and the truth ran through the courtroom like
  a current, unstoppable and bright.'
