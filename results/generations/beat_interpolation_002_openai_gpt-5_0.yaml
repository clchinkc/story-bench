output: 'Sarah spread the photograph on her kitchen table and forced her breathing
  into a metronome. Amy’s eyes were open in the shot, not pleading—calculating, the
  way Sarah’s got before a bad door. The red-marker number bled through the paper.
  Seventy-two hours. Options.


  Option one: recant. Walk into court Monday and say, “I was mistaken about seeing
  Vincent Marchetti pull the trigger.” She can picture the DA’s face going slack,
  the jury turning, Marchetti’s smile like a cut. Amy lives—maybe. Or Amy dies anyway
  because living witnesses are liabilities. And if Amy lives, the hook stays in forever.
  Next time they want something, they tug. She’d be their alibi machine. The body
  in the alley, the mother who won’t sleep again—Sarah’s sworn duty doesn’t vanish
  just because it’s convenient. She tastes bile. Easy and wrong.


  Option two: go official. Call Morrison. Trigger the threat protocol. Get the Marshals.
  Put a BOLO on Amy, trace the number, canvass warehouses. She picks up her phone,
  hesitates. The last time they ran a sealed briefing on the Marchetti case, their
  informant disappeared before wheels rolled. A surveillance schedule “accidentally”
  hit the press. Names get into rooms they shouldn’t. The envelope under her door
  means someone knows her building’s rhythms. Official channels mean logs, notifications,
  eyes she doesn’t control. Time they don’t have.


  She texts Marcus: You up?


  He’s at her door twenty minutes later with coffee and the look he uses at scenes
  where he knows he can’t lie. She shows him the photo. He rubs his jaw. “We log it,
  we get you pulled off the stand, we bring in the Feds. Quiet task force. We shake
  trees without rattling the forest.”


  “Can you guarantee no leaks?” she asks.


  He doesn’t lie. “No. But we can compartmentalize.”


  “Compartmentalize like the Garcia raid?” she says. He flinches. The call log. The
  DA’s office. IT. Dispatch. Every compartment is a new leak point. He keeps going:
  “If you recant, we buy time. We rebuild.”


  Recant lands like a brick in her gut. Buying time costs a city, costs Amy later.
  She looks again at the photo, at the fleck of green paint on the cinder block behind
  Amy’s shoulder—a municipal shade she’s seen on a certain row of condemned properties.
  A clue they’ll scrub the second they sense heat.


  Marcus squeezes her arm. “Let me take this upstairs.”


  Upstairs means lights, memos, a siren only the rats can hear.


  Sarah’s duty is bigger than one case, but right now it has a face. She can’t lie
  on the stand. She can’t trust the building. Which leaves the third line she’s been
  circling: do both. Keep Marchetti caged and bring Amy home by stepping where the
  badge can’t go.


  She closes her hand around her shield, feeling the weight like a beacon. “I need
  the case files,” she says. “Offline.”'
