output: 'The humid salt air of Cape Coast faded behind Amara as the forest swallowed
  the road. She’d walked for hours, the stolen British officer’s jacket too large
  on her frame, a cloth-wrapped packet of plantains and the damning letter pressed
  against her ribs. The servant was gone; the scholar’s daughter walked now, heart
  hammering a war-drum rhythm. The point of no return was not the city gate, but the
  military checkpoint she’d just passed. She’d used her servant’s knowledge of the
  sergeant’s routine—his predictable afternoon lethargy—and her flawless, submissive
  Fante to explain a sick aunt in Elmina. A simple story. But as she melted into the
  bush path beyond the post, she heard hoofbeats. A mounted patrol, coming fast from
  the direction of the capital. They knew. Someone had found the officer’s empty strongbox.


  She couldn’t outrun horses. Amara dove into the thick undergrowth, thorns clawing
  her dress. She lay still, her face in the leaf litter, as the soldiers reined up
  at the fork. “Check the main road to Elmina first,” a voice barked in English. “The
  thief took military correspondence. A house girl, they said. She can’t have gone
  far into the bush.” Amara’s breath froze. *Thief*. The word, once a lash, now felt
  like a badge. She was not a thief of spoons or shillings. She was a thief of secrets,
  of time, of their very plans. As the hoofbeats faded down the coastal road, she
  rose, brushing dirt from her clothes. The servant who hid was gone. In her place
  was a woman who would intercept.


  Two days later, parched and footsore, Amara found the river crossing marked in her
  father’s coded notes. A lone, weathered trader named Kofi poled a raft across the
  muddy water. His eyes, assessing her worn dress and sharp gaze, held no warmth.
  “The forest is no place for a woman alone,” he stated in Twi, barring her way onto
  the raft. “The British hunt spies. So do the Ashanti, for the right price.” It was
  a test, draped as warning.


  Amara answered carefully in his dialect, her mind racing. He was either a network
  sentinel or a profiteer. “I seek a wise elder, to settle a family dispute over land
  deeds,” she said, using the resistance’s phrase for seeking guidance. Kofi’s expression
  didn’t change. He pointed to a crude British notice nailed to a tree, offering reward
  for information on “seditious persons.” The script was smeared. “Read that to me,”
  he demanded, switching to pidgin English. “My eyes are old.”


  It was a trap. A simple village trader might not read, but would he ask a random
  woman? Amara squinted at the notice, then deliberately mispronounced the words,
  mangling “seditious” into nonsense, playing the unlettered rustic. She saw the slightest
  relaxation in his shoulders. He grunted, gesturing her aboard. As they crossed,
  he spoke low. “The ‘elder’ has moved camp. The British burned the last village that
  sheltered couriers.” Her blood ran cold. This was the new knowledge: the cost was
  already being paid in ash and blood. The danger was no longer abstract; it was a
  scorched-earth policy riding upcountry.


  The raft nudged the far bank. Suddenly, from downstream, came the distinct crack
  of a Snider-Enfield rifle. Kofi shoved her into the reeds. “Patrol. Go. Follow the
  river north until you see the lightning-struck silk-cotton tree, then east. Run!”
  She ran, the sounds of shouting and splashing propelling her. The enemy was no longer
  behind; they were on all sides.


  Another day’s frantic travel brought her to the foothills. The lightning-struck
  tree, a giant skeletal claw against the sky, pointed her east toward the rumored
  stronghold. Here, Amara forced herself to stop. She ate the last plantain, her hands
  trembling not from hunger but the precipice she faced. To enter the stronghold was
  to fully become the thing the British would hang her for. She could still turn aside,
  vanish into a remote village, merely survive. But survival without defiance was
  just a slower death. She chose resistance.


  The final obstacle was a narrow gorge, the only approach to the hidden valley. A
  makeshift gate of lashed logs blocked it, guarded by two armed, wary men in a mix
  of traditional and colonial garb. They leveled muskets. “Halt! No one passes.”


  Then, from the rocks above, a British voice shouted in German: “*Schnell! Umzingeln
  Sie die Eingeborenen!*” Quick! Surround the natives! Amara’s heart seized. The patrol
  had tracked her. The guards spun, raising weapons toward the cliff tops. But Amara
  heard the grammatical error, the flat accent. It was not a German officer. It was
  a ruse. She remembered the letter she carried, the one she’d stolen in Cape Coast—it
  contained a footnote in German, detailing signals. This was a loyalist trick.


  “Don’t fire!” she cried out, then repeated the command in clear, textbook German:
  “*Das ist eine Falle. Sie sind nicht Deutsch.*” *This is a trap. They are not German.*
  The guards hesitated. From the rocks, a curse rang out in English. A shot splintered
  the log near her head—the true enemy, revealed. Her stolen knowledge, first used
  to decode the threat, now disarmed its deception. The guards dragged her inside
  as their own shots echoed up the cliff. The gate slammed shut behind her. She had
  arrived, not as a messenger, but as a weapon they did not know they possessed.'
