output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  radiating a cold, crushing dread that felt less like heat and more like memory.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled, its voice echoing not in the
  air, but inside her skull. "Because you know you deserve to fail. Just like you
  failed him."


  Kira froze. The dragon didn’t breathe fire; it breathed guilt. The smoke coalescing
  around its jaws took the shape of her brother’s face, pale and accusing, exactly
  as he looked the day she hadn''t been fast enough to save him.


  "Stronger warriors have tried," the beast hissed, the smoke-face twisting in agony.
  "But you are weak. You let him die."


  Kira screamed, swinging her sword, but her blade passed harmlessly through the smoke.
  The dragon swatted her aside with a claw of solid shadow. She hit the stone hard,
  darkness swarming her vision.


  Three times she was knocked down, and three times she rose again, but each time
  she rose slower, the weight of her failure pinning her to the ground. The dragon
  loomed over her, jaws opening to swallow her whole.


  *Let go,* a dark voice whispered. *Join him.*


  For a heartbeat, Kira surrendered. She let the darkness take her. In that void,
  she saw her brother again. He wasn''t accusing her; he was waiting. And in his eyes,
  she saw the truth she had denied for years: his death wasn''t her sin to carry,
  but his choice to make.


  The guilt shattered. The weight vanished.


  Kira’s eyes snapped open, burning with a new, violet light. She wasn''t fighting
  for redemption anymore; she was fighting for the future.


  When the dragon lunged, expecting a broken child, it found a warrior reborn. She
  didn''t dodge. She stepped into the darkness, her blade glowing with acceptance.
  With the last of her strength, she drove her sword through the gap in its scales,
  piercing the heart of her own despair.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar, dissolving into harmless
  mist. Kira stood amidst the fading shadows, no longer trembling. The girl who entered
  the chasm was dead; the woman who remained sheathed her sword, finally whole.'
