output: 'Morning light slanted through the dusty windows of Marcus’s Curiosity Shop,
  catching on rows of tarnished astrolabes and glass jars of dried moon-moss. Elena
  hovered just inside the doorway, coat still buttoned, as if a quick retreat might
  yet be possible.


  Marcus looked up from polishing a silver spyglass. Old scars mapped his knuckles,
  but his eyes were bright, appraising. “Your grandmother’s map kept me awake half
  the night,” he said, as though they’d been discussing it for years. “It names places
  I searched for decades ago—and one I never dared.”


  Elena hugged her arms. “I told her ghost I’m not the daring type.”


  “Daring is overrated.” He set the spyglass aside and produced a weather-worn satchel.
  “Organization, observation, cataloging—those keep you alive. Librarian skills, yes?”
  He began packing: flint, a coil of silk rope, a field guide so annotated its margins
  looked like vines. Finally, a brass compass with runes etched around the rim. “It
  points to resonances, not directions. Trust what it shows, even when it spins.”


  She managed a thin smile. “Books and spinning needles against haunted woods. Comforting.”


  Marcus laughed softly. “I once thought the same. Then I learned the bravest thing
  isn’t swinging a sword—it’s entering the unknown with nothing but what you already
  are.” He met her gaze. “You catalog stories. Now one of them is asking to be written
  from the inside.”


  A tremor of possibility stirred beneath her doubt. She slipped the satchel’s strap
  over her shoulder, heavier than expected yet somehow fitting. “I’ll keep it safe,”
  she whispered, unsure whether she meant the gear or the story.


  “Just keep moving,” Marcus said, turning back to his spyglass. “The forest judges
  intent.”


  Outside, the road to Thornwood waited, and Elena found herself taking the first
  step toward it.'
