  The segment properly executes the Dark Night of the Soul beat. It follows the All
  Is Lost moment (the gallery''s closure), shows Maya alone and isolated in her dark
  apartment, and focuses on genuine despair and reflection on her failure to keep
  her promise to her mother. There are no solutions presented, only the weight of
  the loss, and it includes a "whiff of death" through the memory of her mother''s
  passing. The tone is quiet, internal, and vulnerable as required.'
