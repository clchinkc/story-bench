output: 'The *Tsarina* cut through the Mediterranean like a blade, its decks thrumming
  with the bassline of a DJ’s set as Monaco’s Grand Prix roared in the distance. Miriam
  Delacroix adjusted the diamond choker at her throat—*borrowed* from a jeweler in
  Cannes—and sipped her champagne, scanning the crowd. The oligarch’s yacht was a
  gilded cage of the rich and reckless, exactly the kind of place where a stolen Renaissance
  masterpiece might go unnoticed.


  Her earpiece crackled. *"Miri, the painting’s in the vault below deck. Sorokin’s
  got it under glass like it’s the damn Crown Jewels."* That was Leo, her tech guy,
  his voice smooth as the whiskey he’d been nursing all night. *"But good news—his
  security’s more about showing off than actual protection. Motion sensors, pressure
  plates, the usual. Child’s play."*


  Miri smirked. "If it were child’s play, we wouldn’t be getting paid."


  Across the deck, her crew moved like shadows in the sunlight. Jace, her muscle,
  was currently "accidentally" spilling a tray of canapés onto a Russian bodyguard’s
  shoes, buying time. Lina, her forger, had already swapped out the guest list with
  a fake—one that included Miri as *Madame Claudette Dubois*, art dealer extraordinaire.
  And then there was Elias, her lockpick, currently flirting with a bored socialite
  near the stairwell. *"Distraction’s in place,"* he murmured. *"You’re clear to move."*


  Miri set her glass down and glided toward the lower deck, her heels clicking against
  the polished teak. The vault door was exactly where Leo said it would be, tucked
  behind a bookshelf in Sorokin’s private study. She knelt, pulling a slim case from
  her clutch. Inside, a set of lockpicks gleamed. *"Pressure plates first,"* Leo reminded
  her. *"Step where I tell you."*


  She did, her movements precise, her breath steady. The first plate gave a soft *click*
  as she bypassed it. The second required a hairpin and a prayer. By the third, she
  was humming under her breath—*"La Vie en Rose,"* because even thieves had standards.


  Then the lights flickered.


  *"Uh, Miri?"* Leo’s voice was tight. *"We’ve got a problem. Sorokin’s got a new
  security consultant. Some woman. She just rerouted the camera feeds manually. She
  knows what she’s doing."*


  Miri froze. *"Describe her."*


  *"Blonde. Sharp. Moves like she owns the place."*


  Her stomach dropped. *Claire.*


  The woman who’d framed her. The mentor who’d taught her everything—then left her
  to rot.


  The vault door hissed open.

  The painting was there, bathed in soft light, its colors still vibrant after centuries.
  *The Annunciation*, stolen from a Jewish family in Amsterdam in 1942. Miri’s fingers
  twitched. This was why she did this. Not for the money, not for the thrill—because
  some things *belonged* somewhere, and she was the one who put them back.


  *"Miri, we’ve got company,"* Jace’s voice cut in, urgent. *"Sorokin’s heading your
  way. And he’s got that woman with him."*


  She didn’t hesitate. She grabbed the painting, slipping it into the false-bottomed
  briefcase she’d brought, and turned—just as the study door swung open.


  Viktor Sorokin stood there, his smile all teeth. *"Ah, Madame Dubois. I was wondering
  when you’d show your face."*


  Behind him, Claire stepped into the light, her gaze locking onto Miri’s. *"Hello,
  Miriam."*


  The air left the room.


  *"You,"* Miri said, her voice low.


  Claire tilted her head, amused. *"Did you really think I wouldn’t recognize your
  work? The choker, the guest list, the *timing*? You always did have a flair for
  the dramatic."*


  Sorokin chuckled. *"You know this woman?"*


  *"Oh, we go way back,"* Claire said, stepping forward. *"She was my student. Until
  she decided to steal from me."*


  Miri’s grip tightened on the briefcase. *"You framed me."*


  *"And you *deserved* it,"* Claire snapped, her composure slipping for just a second.
  *"You were sloppy. You got caught. And then you had the *audacity* to act like the
  victim."*


  Sorokin’s smile faded. *"Enough. The painting—"*


  *"Is mine,"* Miri said, cutting him off. She hit the panic button on her earpiece—the
  signal for the crew to move. *"And it’s going back where it belongs."*


  Claire’s eyes narrowed. *"You’re not walking out of here with it."*


  Miri didn’t wait to find out what she meant. She bolted for the door, shoving past
  Sorokin as alarms blared to life. The yacht lurched—*Leo, you beautiful bastard,
  you cut the engines*—and the deck tilted just enough to send a tray of champagne
  flutes crashing to the floor.


  *"Miri, we’ve got a problem!"* Jace’s voice was strained. *"Security’s locking down
  the exits. And Lina’s stuck in the kitchen—someone recognized her from that job
  in Paris!"*


  She skidded to a halt at the top of the stairs. The party was in chaos, guests screaming
  as armed guards fanned out. Claire was already barking orders, her voice cutting
  through the noise.


  *"Miri, what’s the call?"* Elias asked, his usual charm replaced by something sharper.


  She looked at the briefcase in her hand. The painting. The *reason* she did this.


  Then she looked at the kitchen door, where Lina was trapped.


  Claire’s voice rang out again. *"Find her. And bring me that painting."*


  Miri made her choice.


  *"Leo,"* she said, her voice steady. *"Blow the starboard exit."*


  *"You’re sure?"*


  *"Do it."*


  The explosion rocked the yacht, sending a plume of smoke and debris into the air.
  The guards scattered. Miri turned to Elias. *"Get Lina out. Now."*


  *"And you?"*


  She adjusted her grip on the briefcase. *"I’m ending this."*


  Claire was waiting for her on the upper deck, the wind whipping her blonde hair
  into a frenzy. The Grand Prix’s roar filled the silence between them.


  *"You always were sentimental,"* Claire said, stepping forward. *"That’s your weakness."*


  Miri didn’t flinch. *"No. My weakness was trusting you."*


  Claire lunged.


  The briefcase hit the deck with a thud as Miri dodged, her years of training kicking
  in. Claire was fast, but Miri was *angry*. She blocked a strike, twisted, and sent
  Claire stumbling back.


  *"You don’t get to take this from me,"* Miri snarled. *"Not again."*


  Claire wiped blood from her lip, grinning. *"Oh, Miriam. This was never about the
  painting."*


  The yacht groaned as it listed further, the explosion’s damage spreading. Miri’s
  earpiece crackled. *"Miri, we’re out! But you’ve got thirty seconds before this
  thing goes down!"*


  She didn’t take her eyes off Claire. *"Then I guess we’re done here."*


  Claire’s smile faltered. *"You’re really going to let it sink? After all this?"*


  Miri picked up the briefcase. *"I’m not letting anything sink. I’m making sure it
  *floats*."*


  She turned and ran, the deck tilting beneath her as the *Tsarina* began its final
  descent. Behind her, Claire’s scream was swallowed by the sea.'
