output: 'Dr. Samira Hassan’s lab smelled of antiseptic and ambition. Fifteen years
  of peer-reviewed papers and pandemic preparedness drills had made her the CDC’s
  go-to virologist for unexplained outbreaks. Her mornings followed precise rhythms—coffee
  brewed at 6:47 AM, electron microscope calibrated by 7:15, data reviewed before
  the first staff meeting. Today’s anomaly shattered that rhythm: jagged protein structures
  in Patient Zero’s blood sample forming a geometric pattern no natural virus could
  achieve.


  Raj Patel, her perpetually under-caffeinated assistant, hovered by the biohazard
  fridge. “We’ve got three more cases at Mercy General. Same presentation—hemorrhagic
  fever crossed with rapid neural degradation.”


  Samira zoomed the simulation. “Run phylogenetic analysis again. This strain shares
  zero homology with known pathogens.”


  By noon, the CDC containment team arrived in moon suits. By dusk, Mercy General
  became a sealed tomb. Samira watched through her lab’s quarantine glass as gurneys
  multiplied in the parking lot, bodies wrapped in shimmering containment bags. When
  Raj brought her a fourth coffee, she noticed his hands shaking.


  “They’re saying it’s airborne now,” he whispered.


  The virus defied every containment protocol. Negative pressure rooms leaked. Antivirals
  accelerated mutations. At 3:17 AM on day three, Samira collapsed into her desk chair,
  fluorescent lights burning crescents into her vision. Simulation readouts cascaded
  across four monitors, each mutation strategically bypassing immune defenses.


  “It’s solving problems,” she said. Raj startled awake beside a petri dish stack.
  “Not random mutations. Targeted adaptations.” Her fingers flew across the keyboard,
  cross-referencing Patient Zero’s employment records with recent biotech patents.
  Nexus Biotech’s logo bloomed across the screen—a double helix encircled like a crown.


  Raj read the subpoenaed documents over her shoulder. “CRISPR hybrid vector… phased
  antigenic drift… Jesus. They weaponized natural selection.”


  Samira’s email alert chimed. A Norton Antivirus logo flashed on the screen before
  the entire system went black. Across the lab, containment locks thudded into place.
  The air vents sealed.


  Four men in tailored suits arrived as sunlight bled through the biocontamination
  filters. Their leader pressed a document against the glass—CLASSIFIED PATENT: NEXUS
  BIOTECH, stamped in red. “This outbreak’s tragic, Doctor, but litigating blame helps
  no one. We have a vaccine ready for exclusive licensing.”


  Samira’s laugh sounded unhinged even to herself. “You mean a cure engineered after
  your prototype escaped.” She gestured to Raj frantically typing behind her. “My
  assistant just uploaded every genome sequence to an open-access server. Your patent’s
  about to become public domain.”


  The Nexus spokesman’s smile tightened. “We’ll sue you into homelessness.”


  “Already homeless.” Samira tapped the quarantine countdown clock—6:23:17 remaining.
  “I’ve been living here since your science experiment ate Chicago.”


  The press conference began in her lab’s parking lot forty minutes after Nexus’s
  retreat. Samira spoke through an N95 mask, journalists shouting over the wail of
  departing ambulances. Camera flashes lit the hazmat teams still scrubbing walls
  behind her.


  “Viral genome sequences and vaccine formulas are being transmitted to every WHO-affiliated
  facility as we speak,” she said, Raj hovering protectively at her elbow. When a
  reporter asked about Nexus’s impending lawsuit, she shrugged. “Prisons have excellent
  HVAC systems. Useful for avoiding plagues.”


  Winter came early the year the Nexus trials began. Samira’s new basement lab beneath
  St. Agnes Free Clinic lacked biosafety certification, but the ventilation worked.
  Her coffee mug now read WORLD’S OKAYEST VIROLOGIST in chipped letters. Through the
  single high window, she watched snow blanket the parking lot where Nexus executives
  perp-walked past news vans.


  Raj arrived with mail—a handwritten note from Mercy General’s first survivor. She
  traced the shaky letters: Thank you for making it cost them more.


  The old dread still woke her sometimes, visions of tailored plagues moving through
  cities. But here, in the smell of ethanol and community clinic coffee, Samira Hassan
  rebuilt her morning rhythms.'
