output: 'Yuki’s scanner beeped erratically as she moved through the dim corridors,
  its readings fluctuating between normal and impossible. The crew quarters were first—bunks
  neatly made, personal effects untouched. Too neat. Like they’d walked away mid-shift.
  A half-empty coffee cup sat on a desk, still warm. She touched it. *Three days ago.*


  The medical bay was worse. Monitors flickered with static, but the logs were intact.
  The last entry, timestamped 72 hours prior, read: *"Subject 47 stable. Neural resonance
  holding. Commander Reyes to observe."* No names. No details. Just a single, scrawled
  note in the margin: *"They’re not screaming anymore."*


  A shadow moved at the edge of her vision. Yuki spun, heart hammering, but the corridor
  was empty. The air hummed, thick with static. Then—a whisper, so faint it might
  have been her imagination. *"Dr. Tanaka."*


  She followed the sound to the hydroponics bay. The plants were withered, their leaves
  curled inward as if recoiling from something. At the center of the room, a figure
  stood motionless—a crew member, or what was left of one. Their body flickered, half-solid,
  like a glitch in reality. Yuki’s breath caught. The figure turned its head too slowly,
  eyes black voids.


  "Stay back," she ordered, raising her scanner. The device sputtered, then died.
  The figure took a step forward, and the air between them warped, bending light like
  a heat mirage. Yuki stumbled back, her boot catching on a loose panel. She hit the
  deck hard, pain shooting up her wrist. The figure loomed closer, its form destabilizing,
  edges bleeding into the air.


  Then—another voice, distant but clear. *"Don’t run."*


  Yuki scrambled to her feet, gripping her dead scanner like a weapon. The figure
  didn’t advance. It just… watched. Waiting. She exhaled sharply, forcing her training
  to override her terror. *Observe. Analyze.* The crew hadn’t vanished. They’d *changed.*
  And if they were still here, they might still be *aware.*


  She sidestepped the figure, keeping her distance, and moved toward the lab wing.
  The doors hissed open at her approach, revealing a corridor lined with flickering
  lights. At the far end, a single door stood ajar—Lab Seven. The data core’s location.


  But between her and the lab, the air shimmered. More figures. Dozens of them. Not
  threatening. Not friendly. Just… *there.* Watching.


  Yuki swallowed hard. She had to get through them. And she had a feeling they weren’t
  going to let her pass without a fight.'
