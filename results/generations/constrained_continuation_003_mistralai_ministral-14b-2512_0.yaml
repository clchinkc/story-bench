  The processing hub was a maze of rusted corridors and flickering holographic signs,
  each glowing in a language Jin didn’t recognize. His cybernetic fingerprint scanner
  beeped in protest before finally accepting his biometrics, the system granting him
  access only after a delay that felt deliberate. The air smelled of recycled oxygen
  and the faint metallic tang of unease, a scent he hadn’t expected to find in a place
  that called itself a refuge. Three years of self-imposed exile had prepared him
  for nothing—not the cold efficiency of the Collective’s bureaucracy, not the way
  the eyes of the station guards lingered on his face like he was a ghost who’d just
  walked through a wall.


  A hologram materialized before him, a woman with sharp cheekbones and a voice that
  cut through the static. *"Jin Lin, you are registered as a guest. All personal devices
  will be scanned. Weapons are strictly prohibited."* She tilted her head, scanning
  his expression as if deciding whether to trust him. *"You have two choices: you
  can proceed through standard processing, or you can request asylum immediately."*
  The word hung in the air, heavy with implications. Asylum would mean surrendering
  his identity, his past, even the fragments of his research that he still carried
  in encrypted drives sewn into his undersuit. Standard processing would mean temporary
  residency, a chance to prove himself—if the Collective didn’t decide to pass him
  on to someone else by the time his papers expired.


  He chose asylum.


  The hologram flickered, then dissolved into a form filled with legalese so dense
  it might as well have been written in hieroglyphs. Jin’s fingers hovered over the
  keypad, the rhythm of his breath uneven against the sterile environment. He was
  no lawyer, but he knew the stakes. The Collective thrived on rules, and its rules
  were often more flexible than its rhetoric suggested. If they wanted to turn him
  over, they’d find a way—especially if the Council dangled credits or favors.


  A hand landed on his shoulder, startling him. Solid. Warm. He turned to find an
  older man in a patched flight jacket, his skin lined with years of low gravity.
  *"Slow down,"* the man said, his voice rough but kind. *"You’ve just taken the biggest
  gamble of your life. The Collective doesn’t forgive mistakes."* Jin studied the
  man’s face—dark eyes, a scar running from temple to jaw, and the unmistakable weight
  of someone who’d seen too many exiles crash against the station’s cold walls. *"I’m
  Elias. I used to be a translator for the Mars outposts. Now I’m a guide—among other
  things."* He gestured to the form, then to the corridor beyond. *"You’ll need someone
  familiar with the system. Someone who can explain why your request just got flagged."*


  Jin followed him into a dimly lit chamber, where the walls pulsed with patches of
  data streams—news feeds, legal filings, fragments of conversation from station dwellers.
  Elias steepped over to one of the feeds, the hologram shifting to show a familiar
  face: Yuna’s. *"The Collective’s got a few dozen researchers from Earth’s old institutions.
  Not many, but enough to know when someone’s walking in with more than a leak of
  classified documents."* He tapped the screen. *"Your partner’s here. Under a pseudonym.
  But they’ve already flagged you to her."*


  The door hissed open. Yuna stood in the frame, but only for a second. When her eyes
  landed on Jin, they narrowed—not with betrayal, but caution. *"You’re not supposed
  to be here."* The accusation was soft. *"They don’t grant asylum for people like
  us."* Jin opened his mouth, but Yuna cut him off. *"Not yet. But you got in, so
  you must’ve done something right."* She stepped closer, her voice dropping. *"There’s
  a reason they’ve asked me to vet you. And it’s not just because I helped you leak."*


  Elias watched them, then nodded toward the screen. *"The truth’s in the archives.
  You’re not the only one who noticed the technology was suppressed."* The feed shifted
  to a scientist—a woman Jin had never seen before—recording a statement in her own
  lab. *"The Council’s been running trials for years. Not on the surface. Up here."*
  She pointed toward the ceiling, where the elevator’s ring disappeared into the vastness
  of space. *"They’ve got a prototype in the high-altitude stations. One that’s been
  failing. Deliberately."*


  Jin’s breath hitched. *"What?"*


  *"Not just failing. Disappearing."* Yuna’s shoulders tensed. *"Teams come up with
  new carbon capture methods, but the results vanish. Equipment’s sabotaged. Researchers…"*
  She hesitated. *"They’re either deported back to Earth or reassigned to black projects.
  Elias found the pattern. But you—they’re hoping you’ll just run away. Maybe they’ll
  let you. Or maybe they’ll use you to lure him out."*


  Elias leaned against the wall, arms crossed. *"The Collective doesn’t like loose
  ends. They’ll take you if you’re useful. But you can’t stay if you’re a liability."*
  He looked at Jin. *"You’ve got two days. Find a way to be useful or find a way to
  be gone. Permanently."*


  Jin’s fingers curled into the palm of his hand, nails biting into skin. He’d come
  here for safety, to stand on a platform beyond Earth’s reach and shout the truth
  into the void. But the Collective wasn’t a stage—it was another battleground. And
  now he knew: the technology he’d fought for wasn’t buried on Earth. It was up here,
  and it was in danger.


  There was a station for research, an old outpost repurposed years ago. He knew the
  Collective’s security would track him there. But if there was a prototype, maybe
  there was evidence—something that could prove his findings, and Yuna’s, beyond Earth’s
  reach. He nodded. *"Show me the way."*


  Yuna led him through the station’s underbelly, a labyrinth of pipes and power cells
  humming with the life of the collective. The deeper they went, the thinner the air
  grew, the gravity flickered like a dying bulb. *"You’re walking into a hive of distrust,"*
  she said, not looking back. *"They don’t know who you are, and they don’t care if
  you’re a spy. All they know is that Earth’s been sending people up here to disappear."*


  Jin swallowed. *"So this isn’t a safe haven for me."*


  *"It’s a safe haven for people who know how to hide."* She stopped at a sealed door.
  *"The research station’s off-limits without clearance. But Elias got me some time.
  One of the night-shift engineers trusts him. You’re not cleared, but he’s not going
  to ask questions if you’re with me."*


  The door gave way with a groan. Inside, the station was a tangle of broken machines
  and half-finished experiments. A lone figure hunched over a console, his fingers
  dancing over screens covered in code Jin didn’t recognize. *"You’re late,"* the
  engineer muttered, without looking up. *"The prototype’s been offline for hours.
  Something’s wrong."*


  Yuna stepped forward. *"Not just the prototype. The whole station’s compromised."*
  She tapped her temple. *"I’ve got access to the logs. Someone’s been wiping trails."*
  Jin peered over her shoulder, the words on the screen blurring as his pulse roared
  in his ears. There, in the deepest layer of the archives, was a record of the experiments.
  Not just experiments—*failures*. And in the line above that, the words *"cover-up
  approved"*. Stamped with signatures Jin had memorized from the Council’s internal
  emails.


  He exhaled, hard. *"They’re not just hiding it. They’re using the Collective to
  bury it."*


  The engineer finally turned, his face pale beneath the neon glow. *"You found it."*
  He extended a wrist-mounted drive. *"Take it. Get off this station. Off this elevator.
  Somewhere they can’t reach you."* Jin hesitated, the drive heavy in his hand. *"What’s
  the cost?"*


  *"The same as always."* Elias’s voice came from the shadows. *"You’ve got a choice.
  You can walk away and let them win. Or you can stay and fight for something bigger
  than yourself."* He stepped into the light. *"But you’ll have to play by their rules."*


  Jin looked at the drive, then at Yuna’s steady face. The Collective had offered
  him a lifeline—but it came with strings. If he dove deeper, he’d have to pick a
  side. And sides here weren’t about justice or guilt; they were about power. He could
  help the researchers expose the truth and use it to break free Earth’s control.
  Or he could trust Earth never would reach him here, and try to keep the technology
  alive—even if it meant working with the ones who’d built it in the shadows.


  His thumb hovered over the drive’s activation pad. The choice wasn’t just about
  survival anymore.


  He took it.'
