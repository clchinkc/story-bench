output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  Marcus looked at her, then away. "The grant application was rejected this morning.
  I checked my email before you arrived."


  "But the fundraiser—"


  "Cancelled. Half the pledged sponsors pulled out once the eviction notice went public.
  They don''t want to be associated with a sinking ship."


  Denise shifted uncomfortably. "Marcus, there''s something else. I''ve been offered
  a position at the new community center on the east side. I have to take it. I can''t
  afford to stay if this place..." She trailed off, unable to meet his eyes.


  He rubbed his temples, pressing hard as if he could push the pain away. This morning
  his wife had called, her voice tight. With the program closing, their savings were
  depleted. She''d told him she was moving back to her mother''s house until he "figured
  things out." His daughter hadn''t answered his calls all day.


  The fifteen-year-old who''d been with the program since elementary school—the one
  Marcus had kept off the streets—had been arrested last night for gang involvement.
  The counselor said it didn''t matter anymore anyway. The program was closing.


  Marcus sat alone at his desk as Denise''s footsteps faded down the hallway. The
  desk was bare except for the eviction notice. No options. No team. No family waiting
  at home. No program worth saving. No next move.


  Just the sound of the building emptying around him.'
