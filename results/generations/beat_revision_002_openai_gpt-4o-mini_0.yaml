output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director. Her
  voice trembled, a flicker of desperation.


  "I don''t know." Marcus slumped into his chair, the weight of defeat pressing down.
  "We could try to find another location, but the rent anywhere else would be triple
  what we pay here."


  She clenched her fists, but he could see the doubt creeping into her eyes. "What
  about the fundraiser? We still have three weeks. If we could raise enough—"


  "Maybe." He rubbed his temples, the familiar ache now sharp and unforgiving. "But
  what if it’s not enough? And that grant application we submitted? We should hear
  back next week, but... what if we don’t?"


  His phone buzzed, the sound grating against the silence. He glanced at the screen:
  a text from his wife. "Don''t worry, honey. We''ll figure this out together. Pizza
  tonight?"


  The words felt hollow. It was bad, really bad. He had faced tough times before,
  but this felt different. The community center was more than just a building—it was
  a sanctuary for the kids who needed it most. He felt the walls closing in, the life
  he’d built crumbling around him.


  Denise’s expression shifted, uncertainty dawning. "Maybe we can still hold on,"
  she said, voice faltering.


  "Can we?" he whispered, the weight of isolation pressing heavily on his chest. He
  looked at her, realizing she was clinging to hope he no longer felt. "I don’t know
  if I can keep fighting this."


  Denise’s eyes glistened, but he could see she was already preparing to step back,
  to let go. In that moment, he felt utterly alone, stripped of every option, every
  glimmer of support. The air felt thick with loss, and he knew that the center—his
  lifeline—was slipping away.'
