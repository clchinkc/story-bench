output: 'The processing hub was a labyrinth of repurposed shipping containers welded
  into a spiraling corridor, the air thick with the scent of ozone and recycled oxygen.
  Jin’s boots stuck slightly to the metal grating as he followed the flickering holographic
  arrows, his duffel bag slung over one shoulder. The Collective’s gravity was lighter
  than Earth’s—just enough to keep his stomach from rebelling, but not enough to feel
  grounded. He wondered if that was intentional.


  A woman with silver-streaked hair and a cybernetic eye patch leaned against the
  bulkhead outside the processing office, arms crossed. She wore a patched jumpsuit
  with the insignia of the *Astra’s Dawn*—one of the Collective’s oldest stations.
  “You’re the climate leaker,” she said, not a question. “Jin, right?”


  He hesitated. “How did you—”


  “News travels fast when it’s about Earth’s favorite pariah.” She pushed off the
  wall and extended a hand. “Captain Elias Voss. I run the *Dawn*. You’re assigned
  to my station.”


  Jin shook her hand, her grip firm. “You’re my mentor?”


  Elias snorted. “Mentor’s a strong word. More like your babysitter. The Collective
  doesn’t trust outsiders, and you’re about as green as they come.” She jerked her
  chin toward the office. “Processing’ll take your prints, your retinal scan, and
  your dignity. Then you’re mine.”


  The processing officer—a wiry man with a permanent scowl—confiscated Jin’s Earth-issued
  datapad and replaced it with a Collective-approved device, its interface cluttered
  with unfamiliar icons. “No external comms,” the officer warned. “No messages to
  the surface. You break that, you’re out the airlock.”


  Jin’s throat tightened. *No contact. No way to know if Yuna made it out.*


  Elias led him through the station’s central hub, a cavernous space lined with hydroponic
  gardens and makeshift markets. The air hummed with a dozen languages, the chatter
  of traders, the clank of tools. “This is the Bazaar,” she said. “Where the Collective’s
  black market thrives. You need something, you come here. But don’t ask too many
  questions.”


  A vendor with a mechanical arm waved them over, offering “authentic Earth coffee”—a
  lie, Jin knew, but the scent was intoxicating. Elias dragged him past. “Later. First,
  you need to understand the rules.”


  She pulled him into a cramped observation deck, the viewport revealing the curve
  of Earth below, swirled with storms. “The Collective isn’t a democracy,” she said.
  “It’s a survival pact. We take in exiles, dissidents, anyone Earth wants to forget.
  But we don’t do charity. You work, you contribute, or you’re deadweight.”


  Jin swallowed. “What’s the work?”


  Elias’s cybernetic eye whirred as it focused on him. “You’re a climate scientist.
  That makes you valuable. But the Collective doesn’t care about saving the planet.
  We care about *our* planet—the stations, the habitats, the people who live here.
  You want to fight Earth’s corruption? Fine. But you do it *our* way.”


  She tapped her wrist display, and a hologram flickered to life—a schematic of the
  suppressed carbon capture tech. Jin’s breath caught. “Where did you get this?”


  “Stolen,” Elias said. “Same as yours. But we’ve been reverse-engineering it for
  months.”


  Jin’s fingers twitched. “It’s not just about carbon. The data I leaked—there was
  something else. A secondary function. Something the Council buried deeper.”


  Elias’s expression darkened. “Show me.”

  The *Astra’s Dawn* was a relic—a rotating cylinder station with patched-up solar
  panels and a crew that moved like they were one step ahead of disaster. Jin spent
  three days in the lab, poring over the stolen schematics, his eyes burning from
  the dim light. The Collective’s tech was decades behind Earth’s, but their ingenuity
  made up for it.


  On the fourth day, he found it.


  The carbon capture tech wasn’t just about scrubbing CO₂. It was a *filter*—designed
  to extract rare isotopes from the atmosphere, isotopes used in fusion reactors.
  The Council hadn’t suppressed it to protect corporate interests. They’d suppressed
  it because they *owned* the patents. And if the Collective could replicate it, they’d
  break Earth’s energy monopoly.


  Jin’s hands shook as he pulled up the data. “This changes everything.”


  Elias leaned over his shoulder. “You’re sure?”


  “Positive. The Council wasn’t just hiding a climate solution. They were hiding a
  *weapon*.”


  A long silence. Then Elias exhaled. “Shit.”


  Jin turned to her. “We have to release this. Not just to the Collective—to *everyone*.
  If Earth finds out we know—”


  “They’ll burn this station to the ground,” Elias finished. She rubbed her temples.
  “You realize what you’re asking? The Collective survives because we stay *quiet*.
  We don’t pick fights we can’t win.”


  “Then we make sure we *can* win,” Jin said. “We leak it anonymously. Let the stations
  decide. Let the people who live here *choose*.”


  Elias studied him, her cybernetic eye unreadable. “You’re asking for a war.”


  “No,” Jin said. “I’m asking for a *choice*.”


  She turned away, staring at the viewport where Earth hung like a blue jewel. “You’re
  young. You think this is about justice. But out here, justice is a luxury.” She
  faced him. “If we do this, the Collective will fracture. Some stations will side
  with Earth. Others will fight. And you? You’ll be the spark that starts it.”


  Jin’s chest ached. He thought of Yuna, of his parents, of the millions still breathing
  poisoned air. “Then let me be the spark.”


  Elias’s jaw tightened. “Fine. But you don’t get to hide behind us. You leak this,
  you take the fall. If Earth comes for you, the Collective won’t lift a finger.”


  Jin nodded. “I know.”


  She tossed him a data chip. “Then get to work. And Jin?” She waited until he met
  her gaze. “When this goes wrong—and it *will*—remember you chose this.”

  The transmission went out at 0300 hours, encrypted and routed through a dozen dead-drop
  servers. Jin watched the signal disappear into the void, his stomach in knots.


  By 0400, the first responses trickled in.


  By 0500, the *Astra’s Dawn*’s alarms blared.


  Elias stormed into the lab, her face grim. “Earth’s fleet just scrambled a patrol.
  They’re heading for the Bazaar.”


  Jin’s blood ran cold. “They know?”


  “Not yet,” she said. “But they will. And when they do, they’ll come for *you*.”


  He swallowed. “What do we do?”


  Elias’s cybernetic eye flickered. “We run.” She grabbed his arm. “And you pray the
  Collective picks a side before it’s too late.”'
