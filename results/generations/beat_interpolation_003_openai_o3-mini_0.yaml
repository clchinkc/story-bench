output: "Dr. Tanaka moved cautiously down a narrow maintenance corridor, her scanner's\
  \ light dancing over half-broken control panels and scattered personal effects.\
  \ At the far end, she found a dented locker with smeared fingerprints and inexplicable\
  \ quantum residue etched into its metal surface. Her scientific mind whirred as\
  \ she pieced together these clues: frantic attempts to escape, physical disruptions,\
  \ and a pervasive, unsettling energy signature that defied normal readings. Leaving\
  \ the corridor, she entered the medical bay where overturned furniture and spilled\
  \ vials hinted at a desperate struggle. On the wall, a hastily scrawled note in\
  \ shaky handwriting alluded to an experiment gone awry and “shadows that moved.”\
  \ \n\nAs she advanced toward the crew quarters, the ambient hum of systems gave\
  \ way to whispered irregularities that seemed almost like voices. Moving around\
  \ a corner, Yuki caught sight of figures flickering at the edges of her vision.\
  \ They were clad in uniform, their outlines blurred and wavering as if seen through\
  \ rippling water. Her heart pounded with both dread and determination. For a moment,\
  \ one of these figures surged forward with outstretched hands, the gesture almost\
  \ pleading. Yuki’s pulse quickened; this was not the expected absence of life, but\
  \ an eerie, altered presence that challenged her every assumption.\n\nPressing on,\
  \ she reached a sealed door marked \"Crew Quarters\" that was partially obstructed\
  \ by debris. Using her portable plasma cutter, she carefully removed the barrier,\
  \ its sizzling metal reinforcing the station’s deteriorating condition. Beyond the\
  \ door lay a scattered milieu of personal belongings and recordings that shed more\
  \ light on the crew's fate—a log of rapid experimental escalation, fragmented mentions\
  \ of dimensional shifts, and desperate final messages. Each discovery deepened her\
  \ anxiety while solidifying her resolve: to understand the transformation that had\
  \ entwined science with something otherworldly, and ultimately, to confront the\
  \ haunting presence now inhabiting the station."
