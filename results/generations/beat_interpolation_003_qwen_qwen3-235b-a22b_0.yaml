output: "Yuki’s boots squeaked against grated metal as she descended into the lower\
  \ decks. The scanner in her hand pulsed amber, mapping the station’s labyrinthine\
  \ corridors while ambient radiation readings fluctuated—subtle, persistent, wrong.\
  \ She paused outside the medical bay, door ajar, its biometric lock fried. Inside,\
  \ cabinets hung open, dermal regenerators strewn like discarded bones. The air smelled\
  \ of ozone and something sweet, cloying. A patient log stuttered on a cracked screen:\
  \ *Subject 12B exhibiting phase shifts beyond 4D parameters. Recommend—* Static\
  \ swallowed the rest.  \n\nShe moved on, footsteps echoing too loudly. The crew\
  \ quarters were worse. Bunks stripped to their frames, personal effects scattered—half-packed\
  \ suitcases, a family holophoto melted into a waxen puddle. Her gloved fingers brushed\
  \ a datapad left on a desk. A voice crackled: *“They’re not gone, Yuki. They’re—”*\
  \ The recording disintegrated mid-sentence.  \n\nA flicker in her peripheral vision.\
  \ She spun. The corridor behind her warped, light bending like water. Shapes coalesced—humanoid,\
  \ then less than. Forms flickered between solid and smear, eyes like quasars blazing\
  \ through fog. Her scanner spiked, then shorted out. The entities whispered, overlapping\
  \ voices tessellating into gibberish. She stumbled backward, breath fogging her\
  \ visor, until a bulkhead door slammed shut between them with a hydraulic hiss.\
  \  \n\nShaking, she pried open a maintenance panel, splicing cables to reroute power.\
  \ Her fingers danced—a neural calibration trick from her grad days—bypassing the\
  \ fried circuits. Overhead lights flickered to white. The scanner rebooted, displaying\
  \ faint energy trails leading toward Engineering.  \n\nShe followed the traces,\
  \ boots crunching over glass. In the reactor chamber, the containment field thrummed\
  \ erratically. A handprint smudge on the console glowed faintly cyan. The data stream\
  \ was a revelation: quantum entanglement logs, energy spikes, a cascading equation\
  \ modeling consciousness as waveform. Realization gnawed at her—a breakthrough,\
  \ a collapse, a metamorphosis. Not death. Not madness.  \n\nBut understanding wouldn’t\
  \ matter if she couldn’t reach the data core. The Lab Seven airlock loomed ahead,\
  \ sealed tight. The keypad flashed: *Authorization Required*. She glanced at her\
  \ scanner. The cyan residue on her gloves pulsed faintly, a harmonic hum resonating\
  \ in her molars. A keycard wouldn’t work. But a living wavelength? Maybe.  \n\n\
  She pressed her palm to the panel. The system hesitated, then hissed open. The shadows\
  \ inside Lab Seven shifted, expectant."
