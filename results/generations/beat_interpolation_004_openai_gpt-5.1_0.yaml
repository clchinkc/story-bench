output: 'Thomas rose, buttoned his jacket with fingers that felt numb, and stepped
  toward the witness stand.


  “Doctor, would you please state your name and occupation for the record?”


  “Dr. Patricia Okonkwo,” she said, voice thin. “I’m a physician and clinical researcher.”


  He walked her through the basics—her medical degree, her position as head of research
  at Meridian, her oversight of the anti-arrhythmic drug trials. Her answers were
  precise, practiced. Too smooth.


  “And as head of research,” Thomas said, “you were responsible for ensuring the accuracy
  of the clinical trial data submitted to the FDA?”


  “Yes.”


  “At any point, did you become aware of discrepancies in that data?”


  Silence stretched. She looked at the defense table. The CEO’s eyes met hers, a quiet
  warning.


  “I… no,” she said. “Not discrepancies that would affect patient safety.”


  A murmur rippled through the gallery. Thomas felt the ground shift beneath him.
  That wasn’t what she’d told him, or the grand jury.


  He glanced toward the gallery, caught the hard line of his father’s jaw, then back
  to Dr. Okonkwo. He could let this go and salvage what he could from other evidence.
  Or he could do the thing every prosecutor was warned against: drag a witness’s private
  terror into the open and hope she didn’t shatter.


  “Doctor,” he said, moving closer, lowering his voice just enough that the jury had
  to lean in, “has anyone at Meridian made any promises or threats to you regarding
  your testimony today?”


  The defense shot to its feet. “Objection. Counsel is testifying, no foundation—”


  The trial judge considered, then said, “Overruled. The witness may answer.”


  Dr. Okonkwo’s hands twisted in her lap. “Yes,” she whispered.


  Thomas took a breath that felt like jumping off a ledge.


  “Who approached you, Doctor? And what was the nature of that promise?”


  Her eyes filled. She looked at him—not at the defense, not at the jury. At him.
  “They… they offered my husband access to the company’s experimental protocol. For
  our daughter. On the condition that I ‘correct’ my earlier statements.”


  The courtroom went deathly still.


  Thomas didn’t press the advantage. He stepped back, giving her space.


  “Doctor,” he said quietly, “seventeen people died while taking Meridian’s drug.
  Their families are in this courtroom. As a physician and as a mother—can you tell
  this jury whether Meridian’s trial data accurately reflected the risks you knew
  about?”


  For a heartbeat, her face crumpled. He saw the choice battling in her eyes: her
  child, or the dead whose names he’d memorized.


  She straightened.


  “No,” she said, voice sharpening. “The data was falsified. Adverse events were removed.
  I have the internal emails and draft reports documenting that. I allowed it to happen,
  and I kept silent. Until now.”


  On the record, under oath, the truth landed like a gavel strike. The CEO’s smile
  vanished, the defense scrambled for objections that came too late, and Thomas felt
  the axis of the trial tilt—irrevocably—toward judgment.'
