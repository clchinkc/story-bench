  The apartment smelled of dust and old promises. Maya had walked inside, her key
  turning in the lock with a finality that made her stomach twist. The gallery—her
  mother’s gallery—was gone. The doors were sealed, the windows boarded over, the
  "LEASE AVAILABLE" signs nailed up like warnings against what had once been sacred.


  She stood in the middle of the empty space, the remnants of twenty years of her
  mother’s legacy scattered at her feet: a few stray tickets, a crumpled program from
  the last exhibition, a single black-framed postcard of a painting her mother had
  loved. The mother’s last work, *A Woman Walking Toward an Unseen Horizon*, had been
  sold to a private collector months ago. Even that wasn’t hers anymore. Only the
  silence. Only the walls, now stripped bare of color, of meaning.


  Her mother had whispered those words to her—*"It’s not about the art. It’s about
  having a place where people can feel something real"*—as the hospice room dimmed
  around them. Maya had believed her then. She’d thought she could hold on, that she
  could make the gallery endure. But the gallery was a building, just wood and paint
  and light fixtures. And buildings couldn’t feel. They couldn’t grieve. They couldn’t
  betray you.


  She’d failed. Not just the gallery, not just the investors, not even the crowdfunding.
  She’d failed her mother’s memory. Failed the idea of herself she’d carried for so
  long: the guardian, the heir, the one who would keep the flame alive.


  Maya’s breath hitched, her chest tight. She should’ve sold the building sooner.
  Should’ve taken the first offer, the decent one. Should’ve let it go before the
  weight of the empty space crushed her. But she’d clung to the hope, even as the
  last of her mother’s paintings disappeared, one by one. She’d believed she could
  make it work, that she could outlast the grief and the creditors and the world that
  kept moving on without her.


  Now, though? Now there was nothing.


  She sank onto the floor, pulling her knees up as if she could fold herself into
  a smaller, less noticeable version of the person she’d become. The darkness pressed
  in, thick and suffocating, but she didn’t care. Outside, the city still hummed,
  indifferent. Cars passed, their headlights bleeding through boarded windows. A distant
  siren wailed, then faded. Life went on.


  But here? Here, time had stopped.


  Tomorrow, she’d have to face the wreckage again. She’d have to clear out the last
  of her mother’s things, sign the paperwork, tell the media the gallery was closed.
  Tomorrow, she’d start the slow, humiliating process of explaining why she couldn’t
  keep the promise.


  Tonight, though, she let herself drown in the silence.


  Her mother was gone. The gallery was gone. And if the walls could talk, they’d say
  she’d failed before she’d even begun.'
