output: 'The tunnel sloped downward, the air thick with the scent of damp stone and
  something older—something that made Zara’s skin prickle. Tomás’s breath came in
  ragged gasps as he pressed a hand against the wall, his fingers tracing a pattern
  in the dust. "Here," he muttered. "The Approach begins now."


  Ahead, the passage split—one path a narrow crevice barely wide enough to squeeze
  through, the other a yawning archway lined with rusted blades that hung like teeth
  from the ceiling. Zara’s pulse hammered in her throat. "Which way?"


  Tomás hesitated. "The crevice. It’s the safer route."


  She studied his face—the way his jaw tightened, the flicker of something unreadable
  in his eyes. "You’re lying."


  A distant shout echoed behind them. The Scorpion Guild was closing in.


  Tomás exhaled sharply. "The archway leads to the Chamber of Whispers. It’s a test.
  The blades move when you step beneath them—only the lightest footfalls pass unharmed.
  But if you trigger them—" He didn’t finish. He didn’t need to.


  Zara’s fingers twitched toward her knife. She’d navigated worse in the slums—tightrope
  walks over alleyways, pickpocketing in crowded markets where one wrong move meant
  a blade in the ribs. But this was different. This wasn’t just about her.


  She turned to Tomás. "Go through the crevice. I’ll draw them off."


  His eyes widened. "Zara, no—"


  "They’re after *me*, not you. If I don’t make it, you still have a chance to reach
  the Library." She didn’t wait for his protest. She sprinted toward the archway,
  her boots kicking up dust as she leapt onto the first blade. It groaned but held.
  The second wobbled. She froze, balancing on the balls of her feet, her breath shallow.
  Behind her, Tomás cursed, but she didn’t look back.


  The third blade snapped.


  Zara twisted midair, landing hard on her side as the rusted teeth swung down like
  a guillotine. Pain lanced up her ribs, but she rolled, barely avoiding the next
  blade as it sliced the air where her head had been. She was trapped now, the blades
  forming a cage around her. The Scorpion Guild’s laughter echoed down the tunnel.


  Then—movement. A shadow detached from the wall. Tomás.


  "You idiot," he hissed, grabbing her arm and yanking her forward. "I *told* you
  to run!"


  She didn’t have time to argue. Together, they dodged the blades, their bodies moving
  in sync—Zara’s agility, Tomás’s knowledge of the pattern. They burst through the
  other side, collapsing against the far wall as the blades stilled behind them.


  Tomás’s hands were shaking. "You could’ve died."


  "So could you," she shot back. "Why did you come back?"


  He didn’t answer. Instead, he pressed his palm against the stone, and a section
  of the wall slid open, revealing a chamber bathed in eerie blue light. The air hummed
  with energy, thick and suffocating. "The Ordeal," he said quietly. "The Library
  doesn’t give its secrets to the unworthy."


  Zara stepped inside—and the world tilted.


  The chamber was a mirror. Not of her reflection, but of her failures. Her mother,
  pale and wasting, reaching for her. The slums, the hunger, the nights she’d stolen
  just to survive. The faces of those she’d betrayed. The weight of it all pressed
  down on her, crushing her chest.


  "You have to let it go," Tomás said, his voice distant. "The Library demands truth.
  What are you *really* afraid of?"


  She knew the answer. Not the Scorpion Guild. Not the blades. Not even death.


  *Failure.*


  The images shifted. Her mother, not dying, but *living*. Zara, not a thief, but
  a healer. The life she’d never let herself want.


  The chamber trembled. The mirrors shattered.


  Zara gasped as she stumbled forward, her hands scraped, her clothes torn. Tomás
  caught her, his grip firm. "You passed."


  She looked at him—really looked. His eyes were bright with something like pride.
  Or guilt.


  "Why are you helping me?" she demanded. "What’s *your* truth?"


  He hesitated. Then, quietly: "My sister was the last scholar to enter the Sunken
  Library. She never came back. I need to know what happened to her."


  Zara’s breath caught. All this time, he hadn’t been helping her out of kindness.
  He’d been using her.


  And yet—she understood.


  The tunnel ahead sloped downward, the air growing colder. Somewhere beyond it lay
  the Library. And beyond that, the cure. But as Zara stepped forward, a new sound
  reached her ears—the distant *click* of a mechanism engaging.


  Tomás stiffened. "That’s not supposed to happen."


  The walls began to shift.'
