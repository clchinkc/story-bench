output: "Sarah paced her small apartment, the photograph of Amy burned into her mind.\
  \ The fear that gripped her threatened to crush her resolve. Recanting her testimony\
  \ felt like the easy way out, a path paved with the promise of safety for Amy. Yet,\
  \ every time she considered it, a wave of nausea rolled through her. She couldn't\
  \ betray the truth; the justice system needed to see Vincent Marchetti behind bars.\
  \ But what good was justice if it cost her sister's life?\n\n“Sarah, you okay?”\
  \ Marcus's voice broke through her spiraling thoughts as he stepped through the\
  \ door, concern etched on his face. He had seen her at her best and worst, but now\
  \ he saw her as a woman torn. \n\n“I got a call,” she said, her voice barely above\
  \ a whisper. “They want me to recant. If I don’t...”\n\nMarcus's eyes widened. “You\
  \ can't do that. We’ll go to Captain Morrison. We’ll push for protection. He’ll\
  \ listen.”\n\n“But what if he doesn’t, Marcus? They have people everywhere. I can't\
  \ risk it. I can't risk her.”\n\nHe stepped closer, placing a hand on her shoulder.\
  \ “You have to trust the system, Sarah. We can gather evidence. We’ll make it airtight.\
  \ You just need to hang in there.”\n\nShe shook her head, the weight of her decision\
  \ pressing down. “And what if they come for Amy while we’re waiting? I can’t sit\
  \ around hoping for a system that might fail us. The department is riddled with\
  \ their moles. They’ll find out before we even get a chance.”\n\nMarcus frowned,\
  \ frustration mixing with empathy. “So what? You’re just going to walk away? You’re\
  \ a detective. You’re supposed to uphold the law.”\n\n“Uphold the law?” she laughed\
  \ bitterly. “The law isn’t saving my sister right now. The law is a game to them,\
  \ and I can’t let her become a pawn.”\n\nMarcus opened his mouth to argue, but she\
  \ held up a hand, cutting him off. “I’m sorry, but I can’t do it. I need to find\
  \ another way.” \n\nAs he watched her, something shifted in her chest. The resolve\
  \ hardened, leaving no room for doubt. She wouldn’t recant. She wouldn’t go to the\
  \ authorities. She had to take matters into her own hands. There was no safety net,\
  \ no backup plan; it was time to act."
