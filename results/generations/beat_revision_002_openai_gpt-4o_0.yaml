output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  "I don''t know." Marcus slumped into his chair. "We could try to find another location,
  but the rent anywhere else would be triple what we pay here."


  Denise hesitated, glancing at her own phone. "Marcus, I didn''t want to tell you
  this, but the fundraiser... it''s not going well. Donations are half of what we
  projected."


  He rubbed his temples. "And that grant application we submitted... I got the email
  this morning. We didn''t get it."


  Silence stretched between them, heavy and oppressive. Marcus’s phone buzzed again,
  but this time it was a notification about his son’s school needing payment for overdue
  fees. His heart sank further, realizing how much his family depended on the stability
  he could no longer promise.


  Denise shifted uneasily. "I’m sorry, Marcus. I’ve been offered a position with the
  developer. They promised me I could continue working with the kids in some capacity,
  and... I accepted."


  Marcus felt the room spin as he absorbed the blow of betrayal. The community center
  was slipping through his fingers. His assistant, his right hand, was leaving. His
  family was losing financial security. He was utterly alone.


  He lowered his head into his hands, the weight of his world crashing down.'
