output: "Miri slid between two hedge-fund princes arguing about lap times, the hem\
  \ of her sapphire dress whispering over the teak deck. Above them, helicopters hovered\
  \ like lazy dragonflies over Monaco’s harbor; below, the Tsarina’s engines thrummed\
  \ with moneyed impatience.  \n\n“Gallery corridor in ten meters,” Jules murmured\
  \ in her ear, voice filtered through just enough static to sound romantic. “Camera\
  \ loop is holding. Sorokin’s guests are now forty percent drunker and twenty percent\
  \ poorer.”  \n\n“Your data sets are always inspiring,” Miri replied, smiling at\
  \ a tray of canapés as if it had personally offended her.  \n\nDani was ahead of\
  \ her, disguised as a harried event coordinator in black. A lanyard swung from her\
  \ neck, laminated credentials studded with more holograms than a teenage sticker\
  \ book. She bumped Miri’s shoulder in passing, whispering, “Route B is confirmed.\
  \ Dumbwaiter shaft from galley to private deck, manual override only. The latch\
  \ sticks, but I sweet-talked it.”  \n\n“You flirted with an elevator,” Miri said.\
  \  \n\n“It responded to emotional honesty.” Dani peeled away toward the galley,\
  \ already on her comm. “Rafa, in position?”  \n\n“Bar is conquered,” Rafa answered,\
  \ Spanish vowels rolling. “These people think a Negroni is ‘adventurous.’ I weep.\
  \ Your corridor is clear… wait. Almost clear.”  \n\nMiri turned the corner toward\
  \ the gallery wing and saw the “almost.”  \n\nA security guard leaned against the\
  \ wall, scrolling his phone, right under the discreet brass plaque for Sorokin’s\
  \ private collection. He was young, bored, and annoyingly in the way.  \n\n“Patch\
  \ me his feed,” Miri said.  \n\n“Already on it,” Jules replied. “Name’s Andrei.\
  \ Two overdue car payments, fantasy football addict, thinks crypto is a personality.”\
  \  \n\n“Exploit the weakness,” Miri murmured.  \n\nSeconds later Andrei’s phone\
  \ pinged. He frowned, then straightened. The fantasy football app flashed a notification:\
  \ URGENT TRADE ALERT. He hesitated, then pushed off the wall and wandered toward\
  \ the far end of the corridor, chasing the dopamine hit.  \n\n“People really will\
  \ abandon priceless art for imaginary points,” Miri said, sliding her forged keycard\
  \ through the gallery door reader.  \n\nThe lock flashed green. Inside, the air\
  \ cooled, hushed. Paintings gleamed in subtle, flattered light, like debutantes\
  \ aware they were being admired. Miri walked the room with the casual entitlement\
  \ of someone who could buy the place twice.  \n\n“Pressure sensors under the main\
  \ frames,” Jules said. “Thermal grid overhead. Laser curtain on the inner vault\
  \ door.”  \n\n“And a partridge in a pear tree,” Miri added, crouching beside a wall\
  \ vent. She withdrew a compact device, the size of a lipstick tube, and snapped\
  \ it into place. The lasers hummed, shifted, then settled back like a cat deciding\
  \ not to scratch—for now.  \n\n“Lasers spoofed. You have eight minutes before the\
  \ system notices it’s being lied to,” Jules warned.  \n\n“That’s seven more than\
  \ most men give me,” Miri said.  \n\nIn the galley below, chefs shouted in French,\
  \ knives flashing. Dani stood by the stainless-steel dumbwaiter, its brass handle\
  \ polished, its side panel slightly warped. She pried it open, revealing a vertical\
  \ shaft just wide enough for a crate or, in a dire emergency, a very compact human.\
  \  \n\n“Confirming Chekhov’s tiny, terrifying elevator,” she said, testing the manual\
  \ latch. It resisted, then gave with a metallic sigh. “Sticky, but she moves. If\
  \ things go sideways, this is our ghost exit to the tender deck.”  \n\n“No one is\
  \ climbing in that coffin,” Rafa muttered. “Not unless death is waiting outside\
  \ with paperwork.”  \n\n“Noted,” Miri said, though she filed away the shaft’s exact\
  \ placement like she would a crack in varnish. Unremarkable now; potentially everything\
  \ later.  \n\n“By the way,” Jules said, more hesitant. “Sorokin’s hired some outside\
  \ muscle. Private security consultant. No name, just a ridiculous day rate.”  \n\
  \n“Anyone we know?”  \n\n“Only got a glimpse from a hallway cam. Back to the lens.\
  \ Chic white suit. Terrifying posture.”  \n\n“So, Monaco,” Miri said, moving toward\
  \ the inner vault. Her heart ticked faster, but she ignored it. Unknown variables\
  \ were part of the job. Tonight, the canvas in that vault mattered more than any\
  \ faceless consultant making Sorokin feel important.  \n\nFor the next few minutes,\
  \ everything obeyed the choreography she’d written: cameras looped, guards redirected,\
  \ alarms lulled. The Tsarina glittered and roared around them, and Miri moved through\
  \ its heart like a surgeon who still enjoyed the theatre of an audience.  \n\nThen\
  \ the vault door hissed open, and the painting waited for her, and for one suspended\
  \ breath it felt like the world was finally, exquisitely, on her side.  \n\nThe\
  \ Renaissance Madonna regarded her from the wall with weary, centuries-deep eyes.\
  \ Miri’s chest tightened; she knew every brushstroke already, had lived with a high-res\
  \ reproduction for weeks. In person, the colors were softer, human. The sort of\
  \ work Nazis had pulled from terrified hands.  \n\n“Humidity at forty-five,” she\
  \ murmured, checking the micro-gauges along the frame. “No recent restoration. Cradle\
  \ still original.”  \n\n“Talk nerdy to me,” Jules said.  \n\n“Give me sixty seconds,”\
  \ she replied. “Rafa, ready with the replica?”  \n\n“Waiting below like a rejected\
  \ lover,” he said from the galley, beside Dani. The replica—aged, cracked, and perfect—rested\
  \ in a custom crate, ready to ride the dumbwaiter up.  \n\nMiri disarmed the contact\
  \ sensors with a whisper of adhesive film, slid thin supports beneath the frame,\
  \ and lifted. The painting was lighter than guilt and heavier than air. She laid\
  \ it into a vacuum-sealed tube, locking it with a soft hiss. False victory or not,\
  \ this part felt undeniably good.  \n\n“Madonna is secured,” she said.  \n\nThe\
  \ speakers across the yacht crackled. A Russian-accented voice boomed, “Ladies and\
  \ gentlemen, your attention, please!”  \n\nThe gallery’s discreet speakers carried\
  \ Sorokin’s charm straight into Miri’s spine.  \n\n“Showtime,” Dani muttered.  \n\
  \n“Don’t panic,” Miri said. “This is the part where he toasts his own ego and forgets\
  \ we exist.”  \n\nThey weren’t so lucky.  \n\nSorokin continued, “Tonight, as we\
  \ celebrate the Grand Prix, I also demonstrate why the Tsarina is the safest vault\
  \ on the Mediterranean. Allow me to introduce the genius behind my new security\
  \ protocols—Dr. Elena Weiss.”  \n\nThe name hit Miri like a dropped scaffold. For\
  \ a second, she didn’t breathe. On the nearest screen—normally reserved for race\
  \ coverage—a live feed appeared: Sorokin on the aft deck, a white-suited woman beside\
  \ him. Silver hair sleeked back, profile sharp enough to cut glass, Elena took the\
  \ microphone.  \n\nHer voice hadn’t changed. Smooth, cultured, threaded with the\
  \ same amused cruelty Miri remembered from late nights at the museum. “Thank you,\
  \ Viktor. Tonight we’re conducting a live demonstration. My team will run a silent\
  \ integrity check of all critical security zones. Any anomaly, any falsified credential,\
  \ any…unauthorized guest will be flagged.”  \n\nMiri’s fingers tightened around\
  \ the vacuum tube.  \n\n“Jules?” she asked, too softly.  \n\n“I’m trying to say\
  \ ‘oh no’ in a reassuring tone,” he said. “Whatever loops we’ve got? She’s about\
  \ to notice someone’s rewriting her symphony.”  \n\nOnscreen, Elena smiled. “And,\
  \ to make things interesting, we will do this in front of all of you. The system’s\
  \ alerts will be mirrored here. Think of it as… a race within the race.”  \n\nGuests\
  \ laughed, clapped. To them, it was spectacle. To Miri, it was a fuse lit under\
  \ every careful plan. The heist stopped being about a clean exit and became something\
  \ rawer, uglier.  \n\n“Abort?” Dani whispered.  \n\nMiri stared at her mentor’s\
  \ image, the woman who had framed her, testified against her, buried her career.\
  \ Elena had always liked tests.  \n\n“No,” Miri said, the word steady but costing\
  \ her. “We adapt. Get the replica up. We finish the swap before her system screams.”\
  \  \n\nConfidence didn’t feel like a costume anymore; it felt like thin ice. Each\
  \ step forward might be the one that cracked.  \n\nThe replica rose in the dumbwaiter\
  \ with an uneven shudder. Dani wrestled it out, hands trembling just enough for\
  \ Miri to notice.  \n\n“Deadline?” Miri asked Jules.  \n\n“Her integrity sweep hits\
  \ your corridor in four minutes,” he replied. “Best case. Worst case, she gets curious\
  \ and jumps straight to the vault.”  \n\n“Elena doesn’t get curious,” Miri said,\
  \ hanging the replica with practiced speed. “She gets suspicious.”  \n\n“And what\
  \ does she do then?” Rafa asked.  \n\n“She hunts,” Miri answered.  \n\nThe Madonna’s\
  \ copy settled into place. Sensors rearmed, humidity stable. To any casual scan,\
  \ nothing had changed. The real painting waited in its tube by the door, a hostage\
  \ needing extraction.  \n\n“Rafa, Dani, head to the tender deck,” Miri ordered.\
  \ “Route B. Take our lady with you.”  \n\n“Thought you said no one was taking the\
  \ coffin,” Rafa said.  \n\n“Congratulations,” Miri replied. “You’ve been promoted\
  \ to corpse.”  \n\nTension hummed beneath the banter now, thin and sharp.  \n\n\
  “I’m not great with enclosed spaces,” Dani admitted, eyeing the dumbwaiter shaft\
  \ again. “Like, really not great.”  \n\n“You mapped that shaft,” Miri said. “You\
  \ trust it more than any guard on this boat.”  \n\nDani swallowed, then nodded.\
  \ “Fine. I’ll ride with the painting. Rafa covers the exit.”  \n\n“Security sweep\
  \ just jumped,” Jules cut in, sudden urgency in his tone. “She bypassed three decks.\
  \ She’s seen something she doesn’t like.”  \n\nLights in the gallery flickered as\
  \ a deeper system came online. Air vents chugged louder. Somewhere, invisible shutters\
  \ began to slide into place, narrowing the arteries of the ship.  \n\n“Locks are\
  \ going remote,” Jules said. “You’ve got maybe sixty seconds before that corridor\
  \ door becomes decorative.”  \n\n“Move,” Miri snapped.  \n\nDani hugged the tube\
  \ to her chest, squeezed herself and the painting into the dumbwaiter. Her face\
  \ went white at the close walls.  \n\n“Breathe,” Miri said, meeting her eyes. “I’m\
  \ right behind you.”  \n\n“You better be,” Dani managed. “Because if I die in here,\
  \ I’m haunting your next restoration.”  \n\nRafa slammed the latch. The dumbwaiter\
  \ groaned downward, carrying centuries of stolen history and one very reluctant\
  \ logistician.  \n\nMiri turned for the exit—and froze as her earpiece crackled\
  \ with a voice she knew too well.  \n\n“Little Miriam,” Elena said, as if they were\
  \ back in the museum’s cold storage, not separated by a yacht’s worth of steel and\
  \ lies. “You always underestimated subsystem redundancy.”  \n\n“Jules?” Miri whispered.\
  \  \n\n“Sorry,” he said, tight. “She found my backdoor. She’s talking on our channel\
  \ like she paid the subscription.”  \n\n“Your pattern is all over this,” Elena continued,\
  \ almost fond. “The elegance. The ethics. Stealing from thieves so you can feel\
  \ like a saint.”  \n\nAlarms flared—muted, for the guests—but along the crew corridors\
  \ red strobes began to pulse. Doors sealed in sequence, metal coughing shut. The\
  \ gallery entrance shuddered, then locked with a heavy thunk.  \n\n“Security teams\
  \ converging on your deck,” Jules said. “Two stairwells, one elevator. Andrei’s\
  \ coming back, and he’s brought friends.”  \n\nRafa’s voice cut in, breathless.\
  \ “Galley’s locking down too. I barely slipped out. Dani’s dumbwaiter stopped halfway—power\
  \ reroute. She’s stuck between floors.”  \n\nMiri’s stomach dropped.  \n\n“Dani?”\
  \  \n\nStatic, then a thin, panicked laugh. “So this is my hell. Great. Love the\
  \ décor.”  \n\n“Manual latch,” Miri said, already picturing the shaft’s schematic.\
  \ “You can override from inside if you—”  \n\n“Not from inside,” Dani said. “They\
  \ cheaped out on emergency features. You have to hit it from the midpoint access\
  \ panel. In the service corridor. The one currently filling with guards, I’m guessing?”\
  \  \n\nJules confirmed it with a curse. “Yeah. That corridor just lit up like a\
  \ Christmas tree.”  \n\nMiri saw the branching paths at once: follow Route A to\
  \ the bow, slip over the side, meet the tender, escape with her freedom but without\
  \ Dani and the painting. Or cut across to the service corridor, dive into the tightening\
  \ noose, risk everything to release the latch and send the dumbwaiter—and the canvas—down\
  \ to safety.  \n\n“And if I do?” she asked quietly.  \n\n“Elena’s already heading\
  \ there,” Jules said. “She’s predicting you. She knows you go back for lost causes.”\
  \  \n\n“Not usually,” Miri said. “Ask anyone who’s dated me.”  \n\nHer hands were\
  \ cold. Her breathing, annoyingly, was not.  \n\n“Painting or revenge,” Rafa said,\
  \ voice raw. “Pick. We can regroup another night. But Dani…”  \n\nHe didn’t finish.\
  \ He didn’t need to.  \n\nMiri thought of the Amsterdam family’s letters, the trembling\
  \ signatures. She thought of Elena’s testimony, the way the older woman had looked\
  \ at her across the courtroom, eyes dry. She thought of Dani, trying to laugh in\
  \ a metal coffin because Miri had told her to trust it.  \n\n“I’m not leaving her,”\
  \ Miri said.  \n\n“That’s the wrong choice,” Elena purred in her ear.  \n\n“It’s\
  \ the human one,” Miri answered, stepping away from the safe route and toward the\
  \ narrowing, blinking throat of the service corridor. The walls seemed to press\
  \ in with every stride, red lights strobing like a heartbeat gone wrong.  \n\n“Jules,\
  \ guide me to that access panel,” she said. “Rafa, get to the tender and be ready\
  \ to pull them out. I’ll bring Elena the test she wanted.”"
