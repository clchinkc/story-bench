output: 'Processing meant three days in a cramped quarantine pod while the Collective''s
  decentralized councils debated whether to accept him. Jin watched the arguments
  unfold on a public feed—his name reduced to a case number, his life dissected by
  strangers who owed him nothing.


  The Collective wasn''t a government. It was an argument that never ended. Seven
  stations, forty thousand people, and no central authority. Decisions emerged from
  endless debate, reputation scores, and something called "consensus pressure" that
  Jin didn''t fully understand. His Earth instincts—find the person in charge, make
  your case, move on—were useless here.


  On the fourth day, a woman appeared at his pod. Gray-haired, sharp-eyed, with the
  careful movements of someone who''d spent decades in low gravity.


  "I''m Asha," she said. "I argued for your admission. Don''t make me regret it."


  She became his translator for this alien world. Over the following weeks, Asha taught
  him how decisions actually happened—not through votes but through patient coalition-building,
  through proving your value before asking for anything. She''d been a climate scientist
  herself, once. Had fled Earth twelve years ago when her research on methane feedback
  loops had been buried.


  "The Collective isn''t paradise," she warned him. "We survive by being useful to
  Earth while staying just independent enough to be inconvenient to crush. That balance
  is everything."


  Jin threw himself into the search for allies, for resources, for any way to continue
  the fight he''d started. He found sympathetic engineers, activists who maintained
  encrypted channels to Earth-side resistance movements, even a small media collective
  that broadcast to terrestrial networks willing to carry suppressed content.


  But it was in the Collective''s shared archives that Jin found something that stopped
  him cold.


  The carbon capture technology he''d leaked—the breakthrough the Council had buried—wasn''t
  complete. The documents he''d stolen were only half the picture. The other half
  existed here, in research notes uploaded by a scientist who''d died on Station Four
  six years ago. Together, the two halves formed something unprecedented: a scalable
  atmospheric processor that could work anywhere, that could be built with existing
  infrastructure.


  The Collective had the missing piece. Earth had the other. And neither knew.


  Asha found him staring at the files at three in the morning. She read over his shoulder,
  and her face went pale.


  "If you release this," she said slowly, "Earth will know we have it. They''ll have
  leverage. They could demand extradition as a condition for any future cooperation."


  "They could save the planet."


  "They could. Or they could bury it deeper and come after us too."


  The choice crystallized in front of him. Keep the discovery secret, stay safe, work
  slowly through proper channels. Or release everything now, blow the conspiracy wide
  open, and gamble forty thousand lives on Earth''s better angels.


  Jin chose the gamble.


  He broadcast the combined research to every network Asha''s contacts could reach,
  every journalist who''d covered his case, every scientific institution that might
  listen. He attached his name to it. His location. His plea.


  Within hours, the Collective''s councils erupted. Jin''s reputation score—his only
  currency here—collapsed. Asha stopped speaking to him, her twelve years of careful
  bridge-building with Earth now in jeopardy.


  But the data was out. Unstoppable. The technology that could save everything was
  finally in the open, and the Council''s conspiracy was laid bare for anyone willing
  to look.


  Jin had found his platform. He had struck his blow.


  And he had made himself a liability to the only home he had left. Outside his window,
  Earth hung blue and white and silent—a world he might have just saved, or doomed,
  and which would never take him back regardless.


  The cost of fighting had never felt so heavy.'
