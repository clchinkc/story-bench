output: 'Miri floated through the Tsarina’s party with a flute of something too pale
  to be honest champagne and a smile that suggested she belonged among men who wore
  watches worth more than her first apartment. Across the deck, Monaco’s harbor glittered
  like a jewelry counter tipped over, and the Grand Prix engines snarled between buildings
  as if the whole principality were revving itself up for theft.


  “Reminder,” she murmured into her earpiece, lips barely moving. “We’re not stealing.
  We’re un-kidnapping.”


  “Tell that to my trousers,” Theo replied. He was below in the service corridor,
  dressed as crew, sweating in a crisp white uniform that cost Sorokin less than his
  cufflinks. “I’m one wine spill away from a career change.”


  Lina drifted past Miri in a scarlet dress, cigarette holder in hand, playing bored
  aristocrat so well it hurt. “The man with the earpiece is staring at you,” she said
  lightly, eyes on the sea.


  “Half the men here are staring at me,” Miri said. “It’s Monaco. They’d stare at
  a chair if it had a neckline.”


  Jules—Jules, who could climb anything that had the bad taste to be vertical—was
  already a shadow on the upper deck, moving between speakers and silk drapes as if
  he’d been installed with the sound system. He’d mapped the yacht’s bones from old
  schematics and an afternoon pretending to be an insurance inspector. His favorite
  detail was the Tsarina’s watertight bulkheads: sleek sliding doors that could seal
  compartments in seconds, controlled from the security room or, conveniently, from
  a manual panel in the galley corridor.


  Chekhov would have loved this yacht, Miri thought. The walls came with their own
  foreshadowing.


  The plan was simple, which meant it was doomed to become complicated on principle.
  Lina would lift Sorokin’s keycard from his tux pocket during the trophy-toast crush.
  Theo would loop the corridor cameras for six minutes. Jules would access the private
  salon vent and drop the painting into a travel crate lined with inert foam—museum-grade,
  because Miri had standards even when committing felonies. Miri would walk in, walk
  out, and return the painting to the Amsterdam family that had been writing polite
  letters to indifferent governments since before she’d learned to pronounce “restitution.”


  So far, the yacht cooperated. Sorokin laughed too loudly at his own jokes; his guests
  laughed louder. Lina’s fingers danced, and the card slid away like a secret. Theo’s
  voice counted down. “Loop starts… now. You have your six. Try not to fall in love
  in there.”


  Miri crossed into the interior corridor, past a cluster of security in dark suits.
  One of them nodded at her, eyes scanning without seeing. Their boss—some consultant
  Sorokin had imported—was a rumor in a tailored blazer. Miri caught only a glimpse
  of profile near the stairwell: silver hair, posture like a ruler, the faintest gesture
  with two fingers that sent a guard to the starboard side. Efficient. Familiar in
  a way she didn’t have time to name.


  Inside the salon, the air was cooler, quieter, scented with cedar and money. The
  Renaissance panel hung above a credenza: Madonna and Child, delicate tempera, gold
  leaf like captured sun. Miri’s chest tightened with a conservator’s old reverence
  and a thief’s newer rage. Nazis had ripped it from a Dutch wall with paperwork as
  thin as cruelty. Sorokin called it “provenance.”


  “Hello,” she whispered, like greeting a patient.


  Her gloved hands worked fast: release the pressure clips, lift the panel, slide
  it into the crate. The foam hugged the frame; the humidity pack nestled into place.
  She was savoring the clean perfection of it when Theo hissed, “Minor complication.
  Your six minutes just became three.”


  “Why.”


  “Because somebody just ordered a full sweep of private decks. Not routine. Very…
  choreographed.”


  In the corridor beyond the salon door, footsteps multiplied. Not panic, not chaos—direction.


  Miri snapped the crate shut and palmed the keycard again, already moving. “Jules,
  status?”


  “In the vent,” Jules said, breath steady. “I can take the crate through the shaft
  if you—”


  A laugh burst from Miri, sharp and quiet. “It’s a painting, not a baguette.”


  She slipped out, crate in hand, and met Lina at the junction near the galley. Lina
  looked radiant and annoyed, which was her default setting. “Sorokin’s pocket is
  emptier,” Lina said. “Also, his security guy just stopped smiling.”


  They slid into the service corridor as a waiter passed with a tray of caviar blinis.
  The party music thumped; engines howled in the distance. For a moment, it felt like
  they were invisible inside the glittering machine they’d come to dismantle.


  Then the yacht’s speakers clicked, and a woman’s voice—cultured, calm, amplified—spoke
  over the party’s laughter. “Ladies and gentlemen, a brief security adjustment. Please
  remain where you are. Enjoy the view.”


  Miri’s stomach went cold. That cadence had once praised her delicate solvent work
  and later signed the document that ended her career.


  She pushed toward a reflective panel and caught her own face, then, in the gleam
  behind her, the silver-haired consultant stepping into the corridor with two guards
  at her shoulders. The woman’s gaze swept the space like a flashlight. When it landed
  on Miri, it didn’t widen with surprise. It narrowed with recognition.


  Celeste Armand smiled as if they’d run into each other at a charity auction. “Miriam
  Delacroix,” she said softly, without the microphone. “Still correcting other people’s
  sins.”


  The false victory sat heavy in Miri’s hands: she had the painting. For a breath,
  she could almost taste Amsterdam—canal air, old brick, a family’s exhausted relief.
  Then Celeste lifted a small device and tapped it once. Theo swore in Miri’s ear
  as his screen went black.


  “Your loop just died,” Theo said. “She kicked me off. She’s in my system like she
  built it.”


  Because she had, Miri realized. Not the yacht’s system—hers. Celeste had trained
  her to think in redundancies, in predictable elegance. And Celeste was here because
  Sorokin didn’t just want his stolen saint protected. He wanted the thief who embarrassed
  him caught, displayed, and maybe traded for favors.


  Celeste raised her voice again, now for the party. “There seems to be an issue with
  a valuable item on board. Please be patient while my team resolves it.”


  A ripple of delighted scandal moved through the guests. Phones came out. The pressure
  became a spotlight.


  Miri backed into the galley corridor, crate hugged tight. “New plan,” she murmured.
  “We’re not exiting. We’re escaping.”


  Lina’s confidence flickered. “You told me Monaco parties were predictable.”


  “They are,” Miri said. “It’s the mentors that aren’t.”


  They ran into Jules by the pantry, his hair full of dust from the vent. He took
  one look at Miri’s face and stopped joking. “That her?”


  Miri didn’t answer. She didn’t have to.


  The yacht shuddered as if reacting to their fear; somewhere, a watertight door slid
  closed with a hydraulic sigh. Then another. The Tsarina began sealing itself into
  compartments, elegant as a coffin.


  Theo’s voice cut through, strained. “Bad news. Security is locking bulkheads. They’re
  funneling you toward the midship corridor. Good news—remember the manual override
  panel in the galley? The one Jules wouldn’t shut up about?”


  Miri’s pulse spiked. “I remember.”


  Celeste’s footsteps were closer now, unhurried, like she knew Miri would behave
  exactly as trained. “Miriam,” Celeste called down the corridor. “You can end this
  neatly. Return the painting. Return yourself. I’ll make sure you’re treated… professionally.”


  Lina snorted, a sound halfway between laughter and nausea. “She means ‘caged,’ right?
  Professionally caged?”


  Jules grabbed the crate. “Let me run it.”


  “No,” Miri said, too fast. Trust was a currency she’d stopped spending freely. Then
  Lina’s hand brushed Miri’s wrist—small, steadying.


  “We get it to the owners,” Lina said. “That’s the job. Don’t make this about her.”


  “It already is,” Miri said, and hated herself for it.


  A guard rounded the far end, saw them, and reached for his radio. Lina moved like
  she was back in a pickpocket crowd, not a death trap: she stepped into him, spilled
  a tray of knives from a magnetic strip, and smiled apologetically as steel clattered.
  The guard grabbed her arm instead of his radio.


  “Lina!” Miri lunged, but Jules caught her elbow.


  “Bulkhead’s closing,” Jules warned.


  Ahead, the galley corridor’s manual panel sat in the wall—gray, innocuous, the kind
  of thing only someone who read schematics for fun would notice. Behind them, Celeste’s
  silhouette appeared, framed by party light, composed as a portrait. She lifted her
  hand, and another bulkhead began to slide, narrowing the passage with a soft, merciless
  glide.


  Theo’s voice went thin. “Miri, you have ten seconds before you’re boxed. Use the
  panel. Now.”


  Lina’s eyes met Miri’s over the guard’s grip. There was fear there, and accusation,
  and something like loyalty she hadn’t earned. “Go,” Lina mouthed. “Finish it.”


  Miri’s fingers hovered over the manual override, then clenched. The crate dug into
  her palm like a promise. Celeste watched, patient, as if this choice had always
  been the lesson’s final exam.


  Miri pressed the panel—hard—then turned back toward Lina as the walls kept closing,
  and the yacht, glittering above, roared with applause for a race none of them could
  see.'
