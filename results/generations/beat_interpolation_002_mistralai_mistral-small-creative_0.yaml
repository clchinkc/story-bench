output: 'Sarah sat at her kitchen table, the photograph of Amy pinned under her coffee
  mug like a crime scene marker. The red ink on the back bled slightly where her thumb
  had smudged it. *Seventy-two hours.* The number pulsed in her skull like a countdown.


  She could recant.


  The thought slithered in, cold and practical. One sentence in court. *"I was mistaken."*
  Marchetti walks. Amy lives. The case collapses, but the department would spin it—*witness
  intimidation, procedural errors*—and the Marchetti empire keeps churning. But Amy
  would be safe. *Safe.*


  Her fingers traced the edge of the photo. Amy’s face was bruised, her eyes wide
  with the kind of terror that didn’t fade. Sarah had seen that look before—in victims
  who never recovered. If she lied, Amy might survive physically, but the damage would
  be permanent. And Marchetti would own her. *Own them both.*


  She exhaled sharply and reached for her phone. *Marcus.* Her partner would know
  what to do. The call connected on the second ring.


  “Chen? You sound like hell.”


  “Marchetti’s got Amy.”


  A beat of silence. Then, “Shit. Where?”


  “Don’t know. Some warehouse. They want me to recant.”


  Marcus didn’t hesitate. “We go to Internal Affairs. Get a protective detail on Amy,
  lean on the feds to fast-track the trial. We can—”


  “And if they’ve got someone inside?” Sarah cut in. “Marchetti’s got eyes everywhere.
  You know that.”


  “Then we go off-book. Unmarked car, no paperwork. I’ll pull in a few guys I trust—”


  “And if it’s not enough?” Her voice cracked. “If they still get to her?”


  Marcus sighed. “Sarah, you can’t do this alone.”


  *But she could.* The realization settled like a weight. The system was too slow,
  too porous. Marchetti’s reach was longer than the law’s. She thought of the case
  files burning a hole in her laptop—the names, the patterns, the debts owed. She
  knew how to move in the shadows. She’d done it before, back when she was undercover.


  “You’re right,” she said quietly. “I can’t do this as a cop.”


  Marcus groaned. “Chen, don’t—”


  “Thanks, Marcus.” She hung up.


  The resignation letter was already drafted in her head. No more rules. No more oversight.
  Just her, the files, and seventy hours to burn Marchetti’s world down before he
  touched Amy.'
