output: 'Elena found Marcus sitting at her grandmother''s kitchen table at dawn, his
  weathered hands folded over the glowing map. The curiosity shop owner had arrived
  before sunrise, he explained, because the map''s light had called to him too—once,
  decades ago, when he''d been young and foolish enough to ignore it.


  "You think books are useless here?" Marcus asked, tapping the runes. "These are
  a language, child. They tell stories. Who better to read them than someone who spent
  her life cataloging truths?"


  He pushed a worn leather satchel across the table. "Inside: a compass that finds
  intention, not north. Dried provisions. A journal—empty, waiting for your notes."
  His eyes held hers, unwavering. "Heroes swing swords. Librarians build understanding.
  The forest doesn''t need another warrior. It needs someone who knows how to listen
  to what it says."


  Elena''s fingers traced the satchel''s strap, feeling the leather''s texture. "I
  don''t know how to be that person."


  "Good," Marcus said, his voice quiet. "The ones who think they know always fail.
  You catalog books? Start by cataloging what you see. Trust the patterns. The map
  chose you because you''re ordinary enough to pay attention."


  She lifted the satchel. It was heavier than expected—not with weight, but with possibility
  she wasn''t sure she wanted. Her librarian''s mind automatically began inventorying
  its contents, a familiar comfort in the unfamiliar.


  "One more thing," Marcus said, pressing a brass compass into her palm. "The forest
  tests intentions, not abilities. Remember what you know, not what you fear you lack."


  Elena closed her fingers around the compass, feeling the metal warm against her
  skin. The map''s glow seemed less like a demand now, more like an invitation she
  could almost accept. She still wasn''t ready. But she was beginning to understand
  that no one ever was.'
