output: 'The apartment was dark when Maya finally unlocked the door. She didn''t bother
  with the lights. What was the point? The gallery had officially closed its doors
  that morning, twenty years of her mother’s legacy reduced to "LEASE AVAILABLE" signs.


  She sank onto the floor by the window, still wearing her coat. The city lights blurred
  through the glass. She’d tried everything. The crowdfunding had fallen short. The
  investors had walked. Even her brother had finally stopped answering her calls.
  It was a complete, humiliating dismantling of her life’s work.


  Her mother’s last painting hung on the wall opposite, barely visible in the darkness.
  A woman walking toward an unseen horizon. Maya remembered sitting in the hospice,
  the smell of antiseptic and dying flowers thick in the air, holding her mother’s
  paper-thin hand. She had promised to keep the gallery alive. "It’s not about the
  art," her mother had whispered, her voice already half-ghost. "It’s about having
  a place where people can feel something real."


  Maya had failed that promise. The silence in the room felt heavy, suffocating, like
  dirt being shoveled onto a coffin. She wasn''t just grieving a business; she was
  grieving her mother all over again. Without the gallery, that connection was severed.
  The legacy was dead, and Maya was the one holding the shovel.


  She pulled her knees to her chest, letting the paralysis of failure swallow her
  whole. Outside, the city kept moving—cars, sirens, life—but in here, time had stopped.
  There was nothing left to do. No calls to make. No plans to execute. Just the crushing
  weight of everything she’d lost pressing down on her chest.


  Tomorrow she''d have to face the wreckage. But tonight, she just let herself break.'
