output: 'The fog seemed to thicken around them, swallowing the graveyard’s iron gates
  and muffling the distant clatter of horse-drawn carriages. Eleanor stared at the
  manuscript, the paper trembling in the damp November air. "Exploiting murder for
  profit," she whispered, the words tasting like ash on her tongue. "It’s monstrous."


  "It is survival, Miss Blackwood," Thomas replied softly, though his dark eyes betrayed
  a deep unease. He adjusted his coat, looking toward the street where the gaslights
  were flickering to life against the encroaching gloom. "The public is hungry for
  it. This manuscript... it isn''t just a recounting of the newspapers. Your father
  had sources. Details that haven''t been printed, details the police are keeping
  quiet."


  Eleanor flipped the pages, her eyes scanning the frantic scrawl. Her breath hitched.
  There were descriptions of the victims not as mere bodies, but as women—lives truncated,
  hopes extinguished, poverty etched into their skin. It was respectful, almost loving,
  which made the horror worse. But then she saw the other details: the specific arrangement
  of a shawl, a whispered phrase overheard in a tavern, a suspicion that pointed toward
  a man of high standing. It was dangerous. If the killer saw this, he would know
  he was being hunted. Or worse, he would come for the hunter.


  "If we print this, we court the devil," Eleanor said, her voice steadying despite
  the chill creeping into her bones. The weight of the printing press’s debt felt
  heavier than the gravestone before her. The creditors would strip the presses, melt
  the lead type, and leave Thomas without a livelihood. They would erase her father’s
  name from the very streets he had served.


  "And if we do not?" Thomas asked, his voice low, urgent. "We lose everything. My
  parents, they rely on my wages. The other printers, their families... this house
  is the heart of them. Without it, we are adrift."


  Eleanor looked at Thomas, really looked at him, seeing not just an assistant, but
  a partner whose fate was tethered to her own. She was a woman in a man’s world,
  expected to weep, sell, and fade away. But she was her father’s daughter. Iron ran
  in her veins, not ink.


  She closed the manuscript with a sharp snap. "Then we print."


  The decision was a blade cutting through her hesitation. She wasn''t just publishing
  a story; she was declaring war on the silence that protected the killer and the
  society that dismissed the dead. She was stepping into the void where her brother
  should have been, claiming a power that terrified her.


  They returned to Blackwood & Sons as the city settled into its uneasy sleep. The
  shop smelled of turpentine and old paper, a scent that had always meant safety.
  Now, it smelled of risk. Eleanor walked behind the high counter, the space where
  her father had stood for forty years, and placed the manuscript on the wood. It
  felt like a sacrilege.


  "Thomas," she commanded, shedding the mantle of the grieving daughter for the armor
  of a proprietress. "Prepare the press. Set the type yourself. Tell no one what we
  are printing. If anyone asks, it is a romantic serial for the ladies'' journals.
  We work in silence."


  Thomas bowed his head, a flicker of admiration in his gaze. "It will be done, Miss
  Blackwood."


  As he disappeared into the back, the heavy, rhythmic thud of the machines starting
  up echoed through the floorboards. It was a heartbeat in the belly of the beast.
  Eleanor stared out the window at the fog-choked city. The Ripper was out there,
  somewhere in the dark. And now, thanks to her, the hunt had begun. She had crossed
  the threshold. There was no going back.'
