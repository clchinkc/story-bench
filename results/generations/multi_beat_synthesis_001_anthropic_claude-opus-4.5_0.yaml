output: 'The woman waiting in the Buckingham''s lobby had eyes like broken glass—sharp
  and full of fractured light. Mira Chen, Rosa had called her once. A Resonant who
  could feel lies like splinters under skin.


  "Rosa''s student," Mira said, the words a wound. "The addict."


  Dante felt the old shame curl through him, but he held steady. Three years clean.
  Three years of proving that the needle didn''t own him anymore. "Former addict.
  And Rosa was more than my teacher."


  "Pretty words." Mira''s gaze swept the lobby, where grief still clung to the walls
  in deep indigo whorls—the community''s mourning made visible. "Words are easy. Marcus
  spoke pretty words too, right up until he sold Rosa''s schedule to whoever''s hunting
  us."


  Marcus. The betrayal hit like a fist. Dante had shared coffee with the man, laughed
  at his jokes. "You''re sure?"


  "I felt him lie. Yesterday. Asked where Rosa would be that night, and his answer
  tasted like rot."


  Before Dante could respond, the indigo grief-shapes convulsed. Something had entered
  the hotel—a presence that devoured emotional residue like a hungry mouth. Mira gasped,
  clutching her temples.


  Dante moved on instinct. He pushed outward with his gift, not just seeing the colors
  but redirecting them, pulling the ambient sorrow away from Mira and channeling it
  through himself. The grief crashed through him—decades of loss accumulated in these
  walls—and he nearly buckled. But he''d felt worse. Withdrawal had taught him to
  endure.


  When the presence retreated, Mira stared at him differently. "You can move it. The
  residue."


  "Sometimes." He hadn''t known he could do it deliberately until now. "When it matters."


  She extended her hand. "Then let''s find the bastard who killed our teacher."


  ---


  They worked through the night in Rosa''s old room, where her calm still lingered
  in soft amber threads. Mira spread out everything she''d gathered—locations, timelines,
  the hollow-eyed survivors who couldn''t feel anything anymore. A pattern emerged:
  the killer struck where emotional residue ran deepest. And the deepest nexus in
  Chicago was the underpass at Fullerton, where Dante''s sister Elena had died.


  "It''s a trap," Mira said quietly. "You know that."


  Dante traced a photograph of Elena—fifteen forever, all that potential turned to
  ash. His guilt lived in his marrow, a constant gray weight. "The killer knows about
  her. Knows I couldn''t save her. That''s why they chose Rosa. They''re pulling me
  somewhere specific."


  "Your guilt is a weapon they''ll use against you." Mira''s hand found his shoulder.
  "Grief I can work with. But guilt? That''s yours to carry or release."


  He thought about the meetings, the sponsors, the brutal inventory of his failures.
  Elena''s face when he''d been too high to answer her call. Rosa''s patience when
  he''d shown up shaking and desperate. The guilt wasn''t something he could cut away.
  It had grown into his bones.


  "I''m not letting go of it," he said. "But maybe I can move through it."


  The underpass waited like a throat ready to swallow. Mira squeezed his arm as they
  descended into the dark where his sister had taken her last breath.


  ---


  Elena''s death had painted the concrete in shades of violet despair and sickly yellow
  fear—three years old and still screaming. Dante felt it immediately, the residue
  wrapping around him like chains.


  And there, in the center of it all, stood Marcus.


  "You always saw too much, Dante." Marcus smiled with borrowed calm, his eyes reflecting
  stolen Resonant light. "Rosa''s clarity. Vincent''s joy. I needed one more—your
  guilt. It''s the purest emotional residue I''ve ever tasted."


  The violet surged. Dante saw Elena''s final moments, felt her confusion, her longing
  for the brother who hadn''t answered. The guilt didn''t just weight him now—it drowned
  him. His knees hit concrete.


  "She called you," Marcus crooned, drinking the emanating anguish. "And you were
  too gone to pick up."


  All true. All deserved. Dante felt himself fragmenting, hollowing out like the other
  victims.


  But in the drowning, he found something unexpected: Rosa''s amber calm, still threaded
  through his memory. Mira''s fierce trust. Elena herself—not the death, but the life.
  Her laugh. Her terrible jokes. The way she''d believed he could get clean even when
  he hadn''t.


  His guilt was real. But it wasn''t the whole truth.


  Dante stopped fighting the residue. Instead, he moved through it—gathering every
  scrap of accumulated sorrow, rage, and loss in the underpass, channeling it the
  way he''d done in the lobby. The emotional weight of a hundred tragedies flowed
  into him and through him, redirected toward Marcus in a tidal wave of raw human
  feeling.


  Marcus screamed as he was overwhelmed—not by pain, but by empathy. Every stolen
  emotion returned at once. He collapsed, twitching, finally feeling what he''d taken.


  Mira caught Dante before he fell. "You''re still here."


  He was. Hollowed out, exhausted, but whole. The guilt remained—it always would.
  But he''d stopped letting it bury him.


  Elena deserved his grief. She didn''t deserve to be his grave.'
