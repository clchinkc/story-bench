output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director. But
  her words fell flat against the crushing realization that every plan had crumbled.
  "I don''t know," Marcus murmured as he sank into his chair. "We might try to find
  another location," he began, then trailed off, knowing the rent anywhere else would
  be impossibly high. His voice wavered with the weight of irretrievable loss.


  Denise''s hopeful gaze flickered momentarily before her expression hardened into
  quiet defeat. "Maybe a fundraiser..." she offered tentatively, yet even her suggestion
  carried no promise. Marcus rubbed his temples, despair coiling tightly in his gut.
  The grant application they had pinned their hopes on now seemed a cruel fantasy,
  forever out of reach. Each avenue of escape had vanished like smoke, leaving him
  adrift in the wreckage of his efforts.


  In that stark, silent moment, the community center—the very heart of his purpose—was
  gone. Denise, her eyes betraying the same resignation, turned away without another
  word. Alone amidst the echoes of his shattered dreams, Marcus felt the weight of
  abandonment press upon him. There were no more lifelines, no one left to shoulder
  the burden beside him. The realization was absolute: everything he had fought for
  was slipping away, leaving him with nothing but despair and a future as barren as
  the empty halls of the center he once cherished.'
