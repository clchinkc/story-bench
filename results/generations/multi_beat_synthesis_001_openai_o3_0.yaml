output: 'The Buckingham’s lobby smelled of dust and sun-baked stone, but the air shimmered
  with bruised purples—old fear—where Rosa’s body had been found. Dante stepped around
  the chalk outline and nearly collided with a woman in a leather jacket whose shaved
  scalp glowed beneath the mezzanine’s broken skylight. Her eyes were the color of
  wet asphalt. “You Reyes?” she asked, voice flat. “Depends who’s asking.” “Marisol
  Vega. Rosa’s second.” The name rang through him like a dropped bottle; Rosa had
  never mentioned a deputy.


  Marisol lifted a tarnished pocket mirror, its surface smeared with crimson whorls.
  “Read it,” she ordered. The mirror had soaked up the victim’s last panic, and only
  a true seer could parse it. Dante’s heart rattled—he’d always needed quiet, time.
  Now Marisol watched, arms folded. He inhaled, counting like at NA meetings—one,
  two, three—and let the colors flood. Crimson fractured into specific shapes: a brass
  key, a numeral 7, and a face half-hidden by a janitor’s cap. He named them aloud.
  Marisol’s stare softened a notch.


  “That face is Lucas Grey,” she said, “head of security for the Council. If he’s
  dirty, we’re already bleeding.” A traitor inside their sanctuary; the stakes tilted.
  She handed Dante Rosa’s silver Zippo, the engraved wings smeared with lavender regret.
  “She wanted you to have this. Prove it wasn’t wasted on you.” He thumbed the lighter’s
  familiar weight, remembering nights when the only flame he craved came from a cracked
  spoon. He snapped it open, igniting a thin, honest arc of fire. Marisol nodded.
  “All right, painter. You’re in.”


  They holed up in a shuttered el train car abandoned on a storage spur overlooking
  the frozen river. News of two more hollowed Resonants crackled through Marisol’s
  police scanner. Lucas Grey’s access codes appeared in every incident report. “He
  funnels victims to the killer,” she concluded, spreading blueprints of the hotel
  across a crate. “Basement tunnels feed into a reservoir of residue—perfect place
  for extraction.” Dante traced the corridors, his fingertip smearing leftover grief
  into faint teal streaks. The color matched his sister Celia’s diary cover; guilt
  coiled, familiar as withdrawal shakes.


  “We go tonight,” Marisol said, sliding him a black respirator coated with salt runes.
  “Killer bleeds feelings into the air. This filters despair.” Dante pocketed Rosa’s
  lighter beside his three-year sobriety chip. “Tools are nice,” he muttered, “but
  nothing filters what’s already inside.” He almost asked Marisol for the comfort
  of a drink, stopped, breathed. Celia had hidden her own relapse from him; he would
  not mimic that betrayal.


  Dusk bled along the river like spilled ink. At the carriage entrance of the Buckingham,
  frost limned the archway, turning residue into glittering shards. Dante hesitated
  beneath it—the symbolic threshold Rosa once called the hotel’s mouth. Memories surged:
  Celia’s last voicemail, Rosa’s laugh, his own hands shaky with trash-grade dope.
  “They’ll be in the sub-basement,” Marisol whispered. “You good?” “No,” he answered
  truthfully, “but I’m going anyway.” They clicked on red flashlights and descended
  past gutted ballrooms where love, terror, and jubilation clung like graffiti only
  he could see.


  In the cistern chamber, Lucas Grey waited, shotgun relaxed against his hip. Behind
  him stood the killer, face veiled by a welder’s visor flickering with stolen hues.
  Around an iron slab, three Resonants lay breathing but blank, colors siphoned into
  tubes that pulsed toward a glass crucible. The crucible glowed lavender—Rosa’s regret.
  Dante’s knees buckled; his own guilt surged, hurricane-bright, drowning the room
  in savage teal. He heard Celia coughing in that South Side alley, smelled burnt
  sugar and vomit. The respirator rattled uselessly; inside his head, he was already
  dead.


  Marisol yelled, fired; Lucas ricocheted into shadows. The killer advanced, visor
  displaying Dante’s teal grief like a trophy. “Been tasting you since your sister
  died,” a distorted voice buzzed. “You make regret exquisite.” Dante sagged, accepting
  the accusation he’d rehearsed nightly. The crucible swelled, hunger aimed at him.


  His fingers found the Zippo. Rosa had once told him flame clarifies color by burning
  the excess. Shaking, he flicked the wheel. A narrow flame licked upward. He thrust
  it into the teal fog pouring off his skin. Fire met guilt, and something cracked—like
  paint drying too fast. The teal flared white, then settled into calm sea-glass green:
  sorrow, not self-hatred. For the first time, he allowed the memory to be a fact,
  not a sentence.


  The color shift confused the crucible; tubes twitched, sucking nothing. The killer
  hesitated. Dante hurled the lighter onto the crucible’s base. Gasoline fumes from
  old maintenance cans caught; a column of cleansing fire roared. Tubes melted, releasing
  stolen emotions in a kaleidoscopic burst that threw the visor off. Beneath it, Lucas’s
  terrified eyes gaped—traitor and predator fused in one broken man.


  Marisol tackled him, cuffs flashing. Freed Resonants gasped as colors rained back
  into them like returning souls. Dante knelt amid drifting embers, Zippo miraculously
  intact at his feet. Its wings were soot-stained, but when he thumbed it closed,
  he felt only a quiet ache where agony once lived. Rosa’s final test, Celia’s final
  lesson: flame doesn’t erase the past; it reveals what’s beneath the smoke.'
