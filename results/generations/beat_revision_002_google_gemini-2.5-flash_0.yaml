output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director. Her
  voice, usually so steady, was thin.


  "I don''t know." Marcus slumped into his chair. "We looked at other places after
  the first rumors. The rent anywhere else is triple what we pay here. Our reserves
  are gone."


  "What about the fundraiser? We still have three weeks. If we could raise enough—"


  "The major donor pulled out this morning, Denise. Said the optics of investing in
  a ''failing venture'' were too risky." He rubbed his temples. "And that grant application
  we submitted? Just got the rejection email. ''Insufficient community impact,'' they
  said."


  His phone buzzed. A text from his wife, a picture of their son with a hopeful smile.
  He couldn''t even bring himself to open it. He imagined their faces, the faces of
  the children from the program. All of them counting on him.


  Denise sighed, a sound that seemed to carry the weight of everything. "So what now,
  Marcus?" she whispered, not really asking for an answer. She picked up her bag,
  her gaze distant. "I… I have a meeting. I should go." She walked out, leaving the
  door ajar, a final, hollow echo in the suddenly cavernous room.


  He was alone. No options. Just the silence, the eviction notice, and the knowledge
  that he''d failed them all. The community center, his life''s work, would soon be
  an empty shell. And he had nothing left to fight with.'
