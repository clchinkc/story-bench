output: "Tomás dragged Zara through a crumbling archway concealed behind rotting tapestries.\
  \ The passage narrowed sharply, stale air thickening with the scent of wet stone\
  \ and ancient dust. Torchlight faded behind them as Scorpion shouts echoed—closer\
  \ now. Zara’s fingers brushed the walls, mapping cracks and protrusions by touch\
  \ alone, her slum-honed instincts overriding panic. \n\n\"Pressure plates ahead,\"\
  \ Tomás gasped, skidding to a halt. \"Third step from the left wall.\" Moonlight\
  \ seeped through ceiling fissures, illuminating faint depressions in the floor.\
  \ Guild footsteps pounded nearer. Zara dropped to her knees, pulling lockpicks from\
  \ her boot. Her hands moved with practiced precision, disabling the trigger mechanism\
  \ just as their pursuers rounded the bend. \n\nA crossbow bolt whizzed past her\
  \ ear. Tomás cried out, stumbling as another bolt grazed his thigh. \"Go!\" he urged,\
  \ blood darkening his trousers. \"The Library’s straight ahead!\" \n\nZara froze.\
  \ Escape gleamed just beyond the trapped corridor—a sliver of open tunnel. But leaving\
  \ Tomás meant abandoning her only guide... and condemning her mother. She hauled\
  \ him up, his weight staggering her. \"Why risk this?\" she demanded, dragging him\
  \ forward. \n\n\"Because the Library holds proof,\" he panted, face ashen. \"Proof\
  \ the Guild framed me for stealing sacred texts. Clear my name... or die hunted.\"\
  \ \n\nShadows coalesced into armored figures before them. Dead end. Zara’s breath\
  \ hitched—not at the blades, but at the crushing certainty of failure. Her mother’s\
  \ hollow eyes flashed in her mind. *I’m not enough.* The admission was a knife-twist\
  \ deeper than any wound. \n\nThen she saw it: a vertical crack in the wall, disguised\
  \ as mortar lines. A thief’s passage. Shoving Tomás sideways, she jammed her knife\
  \ into the seam. Stone groaned. Scorpions lunged as the slab pivoted—and Zara fell\
  \ through into suffocating darkness, Tomás tumbling after. The door slammed shut,\
  \ sealing them in absolute black. \n\nWater dripped. Zara’s lungs burned as she\
  \ crawled through a submerged channel, the ceiling scraping her back. Her mother’s\
  \ face dissolved into Tomás’s labored breathing, into the map disintegrating in\
  \ her soaked vest. *Everything ends here.* She inhaled putrid water—a gasp of surrender—before\
  \ kicking violently upward. \n\nHer head broke surface. Tomás hauled her onto a\
  \ silt-covered ledge beneath a towering archway carved with forgotten runes. Moonlight\
  \ flooded the chamber, illuminating colossal library doors ahead. Zara vomited water,\
  \ trembling not from cold but revelation: survival demanded sacrifice, but never\
  \ hope. She’d carry her mother’s fate without flinching now. \n\nTomás pointed wordlessly.\
  \ Scorpion sigils glowed freshly painted on the library doors—and wet footprints\
  \ led deeper into the gloom. Someone else had arrived first."
