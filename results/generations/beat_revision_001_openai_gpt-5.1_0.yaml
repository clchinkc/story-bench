output: "Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling\
  \ hands.  \nThe creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning\
  \ eyes, exactly as the prophecies had described.\n\n\"You cannot defeat me, child,\"\
  \ the dragon rumbled. \"Stronger warriors have tried. Your brother among them.\"\
  \n\nThe words struck harder than flame. Kira’s breath caught; for a heartbeat she\
  \ saw Taren’s face instead of the dragon’s, soot-streaked and reaching for her through\
  \ the fire. She had let go. She had run. She had lived.\n\nGuilt surged, sharp as\
  \ the cold wind off the depths below.\n\nThe dragon’s eyes flared, feeding on it.\
  \ Shadows leaked from between its scales, coiling over the chasm and wrapping around\
  \ her like smoke. In the dark, she heard Taren’s voice, twisted and distant.\n\n\
  “You left me, Kira.”\n\nHer knees buckled. Flame crashed against her shield, claws\
  \ hammered her armor. Three times the dragon’s blows hurled her to the ground; twice\
  \ she forced herself up through sheer rage. The third time she did not rise.\n\n\
  She lay on the stone, vision swimming, sword a dead weight in her slackening fingers.\
  \ The chasm yawned at her side, a black mouth waiting to swallow her down to where\
  \ her brother’s broken body had once lain. Maybe she belonged there. Maybe this\
  \ was where she should have died instead of him.\n\nThe shadows pressed in, cold\
  \ and suffocating.\n\nThen, beneath the roar of the dragon and the echo of phantom\
  \ accusations, she remembered Taren’s last clear smile, the way he had pushed her\
  \ toward the escape tunnel, shouting for her to run. He had chosen her life. It\
  \ had been his courage, not her cowardice.\n\n“I didn’t leave you,” she whispered\
  \ to the darkness. “You saved me.”\n\nThe words broke something open. The guilt\
  \ did not vanish, but it loosened, no longer a chain—only a scar. The shadows recoiled,\
  \ losing their grip. Her hand tightened around the hilt.\n\nKira pushed herself\
  \ to her feet, not on rage this time, but on a strange, steady calm. The dragon\
  \ hesitated, its burning eyes narrowing as if something it had counted on was slipping\
  \ away.\n\n“You are nothing without your shame,” it hissed.\n\n“I am more than my\
  \ shame,” she answered.\n\nThe next gout of flame met a shield that did not waver.\
  \ She moved differently now—no wild, reckless charges, just clear, measured steps.\
  \ The dragon struck, overconfident, stretching too far across the chasm.\n\nFinally,\
  \ when the dragon overextended on a strike, she saw her opening. With the last of\
  \ her strength, she drove her sword through the gap in its scales, piercing its\
  \ heart.\n\nThe Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over\
  \ its body, victorious but exhausted, smoke and shadow drifting away into the night.\n\
  \n\"I did it,\" she whispered, but the words carried more than triumph. They carried\
  \ release.\n\nShe retrieved her sword and began the long walk back to camp, not\
  \ just ready to tell the others the good news, but carrying a quieter, harder-won\
  \ knowledge: the past could not be undone, but it no longer owned her."
