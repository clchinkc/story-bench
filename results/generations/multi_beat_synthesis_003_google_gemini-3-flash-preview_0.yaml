output: "The roar of Formula 1 engines echoed across Port Hercule, a mechanical scream\
  \ that Miriam Delacroix found wonderfully distracting. On the deck of the *Tsarina*,\
  \ the champagne flowed faster than the cars on the track, and the air smelled of\
  \ salt, expensive tobacco, and high-octane fuel. Miri adjusted her silk gown, the\
  \ shimmering fabric concealing a jeweler’s kit and a miniature thermal scanner.\
  \ She moved through the crowd with the effortless grace of a woman who belonged\
  \ among the elite, rather than someone who intended to rob them.\n\n\"Jax, tell\
  \ me the hull-side sensors are as sleepy as the guards,\" she whispered into her\
  \ cocktail ring, her eyes scanning the party for their mark.\n\n\"Sleepier,\" Jax’s\
  \ voice crackled in her ear. He was currently submerged beneath the yacht’s stern,\
  \ tapping into the fiber-optic security trunk. \"But Miri, the vault isn't just\
  \ keyed to Sorokin. It’s a dual-pulse biometric. We need a live retinal scan or\
  \ a very fresh mimic.\"\n\nMiri sighed, spotting their host, Viktor Sorokin, laughing\
  \ with a group of models near the railing. \"A minor detour. I’ll get the 'mimic'\
  \ from his favorite vintage.\"\n\nShe glided toward the oligarch, her smile a practiced\
  \ weapon. A quick \"accidental\" stumble, a steadying hand on his forearm, and a\
  \ deft swap of his crystal flute for a clean one. As she turned away, she pressed\
  \ a translucent gel pad against the condensation on his glass.\n\n\"Got the print,\"\
  \ she murmured, slipping the pad into her clutch. \"And Jax? Keep an eye on the\
  \ nitrogen cooling lines for the vault. If they're pressurized, the painting’s frame\
  \ is rigged to incinerate the canvas on unauthorized touch. It’s old school, but\
  \ effective. Don't let the pressure drop.\"\n\n\"Copy that,\" Jax said, his tone\
  \ playful. \"I'm bypassing the pressure sensors now. Easy as pie, Boss.\"\n\nThe\
  \ plan was humming. The crew was in position, the mark was distracted by the race,\
  \ and the most beautiful looted Titian in the world was only three bulkheads away.\n\
  \nThe vault door hissed open with the clinical precision of a tomb, the sound lost\
  \ beneath the distant thunder of the Grand Prix. Inside, the Titian glowed under\
  \ the LED spotlights—a masterpiece of light and shadow that had survived a world\
  \ war only to end up in a Russian's floating fortress. Miri felt the familiar electric\
  \ hum of success, a sharp contrast to the cold air of the room. She carefully lifted\
  \ the canvas from its mount, her fingers trembling slightly with the weight of history.\n\
  \n\"Package secured,\" she breathed. \"Jax, prep the submersible. We’re out in five.\"\
  \n\n\"Miri, wait,\" Jax’s voice was suddenly tight, stripped of its previous bravado.\
  \ \"The security feed just refreshed. Someone didn't just bypass my bypass. They\
  \ rewrote the logic from an external terminal. The yacht’s stabilization fins are\
  \ locking. We’re being boxed in by the harbor patrol.\"\n\nMiri froze, the painting\
  \ heavy in her hands. She looked at the monitor above the vault door. The screen\
  \ flickered, replacing the security grid with a live feed of the very room she stood\
  \ in. A woman stepped into the frame—elegant, silver-haired, and wearing a smile\
  \ that had once meant mentorship and now meant ruin.\n\n\"Hello, Miriam,\" Elena\
  \ Vance said, her voice smooth as aged cognac. \"I told you years ago that your\
  \ technique was too sentimental. You always go for the heart of the house. It makes\
  \ you so very predictable.\"\n\nThe realization hit Miri like a physical blow. Sorokin\
  \ hadn't just hired security; he’d hired the woman who had taught Miri everything—and\
  \ then destroyed her career to cover her own tracks. This wasn't a heist anymore.\
  \ It was a curated execution. Elena wasn't just protecting the painting; she was\
  \ using it as the bait in a very expensive trap. The party upstairs continued to\
  \ roar, but the air in the vault suddenly felt very thin, the walls of the yacht\
  \ becoming a gilded cage.\n\n\"Jax, get out of there!\" Miri hissed, but the comms\
  \ erupted in a cacophony of static and alarms. A heavy thud vibrated through the\
  \ hull—the sound of the submersible bay being remotely sealed by the ship's computer.\n\
  \n\"I'm trapped, Miri,\" Jax gasped, his voice barely audible over the sudden rush\
  \ of water. \"She’s flooding the lower ballast tanks. If I don't blow the emergency\
  \ seal, I'm drowned. But if I blow it, the alarms go off and you're caught.\"\n\n\
  Miri looked at the Titian, then at the camera where Elena’s cold eyes watched her\
  \ from the bridge. Elena wanted the painting back, and she wanted Miri in handcuffs\
  \ to finalize her disgrace. If Miri ran for the secondary extraction point now,\
  \ she could save herself and the artwork, but Jax would be a casualty of the 'malfunction.'\n\
  \n\"The nitrogen lines,\" Miri whispered, her mind racing back to the setup. \"\
  Jax, the cooling system I told you to watch. It’s cross-connected to the fire suppression\
  \ in the engine room. If I over-pressurize the vault's lines from here, it’ll blow\
  \ the manifold in the ballast tank. It’ll kick the emergency release for the bay\
  \ doors.\"\n\n\"And the painting?\" Jax asked, his voice strained as the water rose.\n\
  \nMiri looked at the Titian. Over-pressurizing the lines would trigger the vault’s\
  \ fail-safe: the very incineration she’d mentioned earlier. She could have her revenge\
  \ by escaping with the prize Elena failed to protect, or she could save her friend\
  \ and lose the mission. She didn't hesitate. She jammed her jeweler’s screwdriver\
  \ into the nitrogen regulator, twisting it until the gauge screamed into the red.\n\
  \n\"Go, Jax!\"\n\nThe vault erupted in a hiss of freezing gas. Fire flared behind\
  \ the glass as the Titian—the reason for her redemption—turned to ash in seconds.\
  \ The yacht shuddered as the manifold blew, clearing Jax’s path. \n\nMiri didn't\
  \ wait for the guards. She smashed the emergency glass, her dry wit failing her\
  \ as she whispered, \"Next time, we steal something less flammable.\" As she dove\
  \ into the dark Mediterranean, she saw Elena’s face on the monitor one last time—not\
  \ triumphant, but stunned. Miri had lost the art, but she’d broken the mentor's\
  \ script and saved her own."
