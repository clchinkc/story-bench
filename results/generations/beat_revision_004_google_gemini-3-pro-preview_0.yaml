output: 'The radiator in the small Queens apartment hissed, fighting the chill of
  a Tuesday morning in October. Detective Rachel Torres ignored the cold, focused
  instead on the orange tabby weaving through her legs as she holstered her service
  weapon. She scratched Sherlock behind his left ear, right over the patch of scar
  tissue he’d carried since she pulled him from that arson site two years ago. He
  purred, the only companion she needed to say goodbye to before heading out.


  At the Riverside Precinct, the air smelled of stale toner and wet wool. Rachel navigated
  the bullpen, her eyes scanning the familiar chaos she had navigated for twelve years.
  She dropped her bag and immediately pulled the dusty Miller file from her bottom
  drawer. The case was cold—frozen solid—but the timeline still nagged at her, an
  itch her instincts refused to ignore.


  "Black. No sugar. Just how you actually like it."


  Detective James Oyelaran set a steaming paper cup on her desk. He leaned against
  the partition, watching her open the old folder.


  "Three years of buying me coffee, James, and you finally stopped trying to sweeten
  me up," Rachel said, though she took a grateful sip.


  "Three years of watching you stare at dead ends," James corrected, his tone easy,
  lacking the friction of a new partnership. "Captain wants us on the burglary string
  in the Heights. The wealthy residents are getting loud, and the working-class folks
  are getting blamed."


  Rachel nodded, closing the cold case file but leaving it within arm’s reach. This
  was the rhythm: the new crimes demanding attention, the old ghosts haunting the
  margins. It was a stable ecosystem, predictable and controlled.


  Then the phone on her desk rang, loud and jarring against the station''s hum.'
