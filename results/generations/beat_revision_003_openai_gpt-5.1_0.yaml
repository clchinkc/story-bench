output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her

  bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly." Sophie unlocked her phone, thumb

  hovering over the email icon. Notifications stacked over the screen like falling

  dominoes. "Oh, great. Three emergencies while I was gone. Linda needs me to call

  her tonight."


  "Can''t it wait until morning?"


  The old answer rose automatically—You know how it is—but she heard her teacher’s

  voice from the retreat: Notice the urge. Breathe. Choose.


  She inhaled, slow and full, watching the blur of headlights in the opposite lane.

  "They think it can''t," she said, locking the screen instead of opening the inbox.

  "But it can wait an hour. I want to actually arrive before I go back."


  Her mother glanced at her. "That''s new."


  "Yeah," Sophie said, slipping the phone into her bag instead of her hand. "I''m

  trying something different."


  They drove in a softer silence. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through

  the evening haze. Sophie''s apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought

  her morning latte. Each outline looked slightly unfamiliar, as if someone had

  wiped a film from the glass.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, feeling the words land not as surrender to the

  routine but as a decision about how she would live inside it.


  Her phone buzzed again. She let it buzz, watching the city roll past, noticing the

  weight of her body in the seat, the warmth of her mother’s hand resting on the

  gearshift, the thin new space between urgency and action.'
