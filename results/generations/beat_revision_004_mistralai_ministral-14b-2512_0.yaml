output: 'The precinct’s fluorescent lights hummed like a swarm of angry bees as Rachel
  Torres tapped her pen against her notepad, the rhythm matching the steady *thump-thump*
  of Sherlock’s tail against the edge of her desk. The cat—adopted from a bloodstained
  alley two years prior, his fur still carrying the faintest ghost of that night’s
  copper tang—watched her with those unnerving yellow eyes, as if daring her to forget
  the case they’d never solved. James Oyelaran leaned back in his chair, boots propped
  on the edge of his desk, swirling a lukewarm coffee between his palms. “You’re gonna
  wear a hole in that pen if you don’t stop,” he said, voice low but not unkind. “And
  if you’re that fixated on the Martinez file, just say so.”


  Rachel didn’t look up. “I’m not fixated.” The lie tasted like the stale donuts cooling
  in the break room. Outside, the October air carried the damp promise of rain, pressing
  against the precinct’s grimy windows like a held breath. She exhaled through her
  nose, the scent of old coffee and James’s aftershave—bergamot, always bergamot—mixing
  with the cat’s usual musk. Sherlock chose that moment to bat a crumpled evidence
  photo off her desk, sending it skidding across the linoleum. James caught it mid-air,
  his fingers brushing hers as he handed it back. “You’re a menace,” she muttered,
  but her grip on the photo didn’t loosen.


  The Riverside Precinct buzzed around them—dispatch crackling, phones ringing, the
  occasional burst of laughter from the day shift. Rachel’s father had worked this
  same station before her, back when the neighborhood’s wealth had kept the worst
  crimes tucked behind gated driveways. Now, the economic squeeze had cracked those
  barriers, and the precinct’s caseload reflected it: break-ins, petty thefts, the
  occasional flare-up of old grudges. But Rachel’s mind kept circling back to the
  cases that refused to close, the ones that gnawed at her like Sherlock’s persistent
  paws when she ignored him.


  James slid a fresh coffee toward her, the steam curling between them. “You’re thinking
  about the cold files again.” Not a question. She knew he did the same at home, his
  apartment above a bodega in Harlem, the one place he let himself think about the
  cases that got away.


  Sherlock, sensing the shift, leapt onto the windowsill and pressed his forehead
  against the glass, staring out at the street below. Rachel followed his gaze. A
  woman in a raincoat hurried past, her keys jingling. Ordinary. Safe. For now.'
