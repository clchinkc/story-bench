output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos." Sophie pulled out
  her phone, a familiar reflex, then hesitated. The screen glowed with dozens of unread
  emails. She slid it back into her bag. "And the meditation retreat was... intense.
  A lot of sitting quietly."


  "Can''t it wait until morning?" her mother asked, noticing the phone''s brief appearance.


  Sophie smiled. "It can. Linda and the Pearson account will still be there. They
  always are." She looked out the window.


  They drove in silence for a while. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through
  the evening haze. Sophie''s apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought
  her morning latte. Everything exactly as she''d left it, yet she saw it differently
  now. The frantic pace, the constant demands – they no longer felt like an inescapable
  current. She could choose.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, a quiet sense of peace settling over her. She
  knew tomorrow would bring its challenges, but for tonight, she would simply be home.'
