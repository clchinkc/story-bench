output: 'Maya''s hands moved on autopilot, chopping and sautéing as Alejandro''s voice
  drifted from the living room where he worked on his laptop. The villa was quiet,
  the only sound the sizzle of onions and the distant hum of cicadas. She was making
  his favorite tortilla española, the one he''d requested when she''d asked about
  his childhood. For a moment, she let herself get lost in the familiar rhythm of
  cooking, the comfort of creating something nourishing.


  As she slid the tortilla onto a plate, Alejandro appeared beside her, his eyes scanning
  the dish before coming to rest on her face. "It smells like my abuela''s kitchen
  in here," he said, his voice softer than she''d ever heard it.


  Maya smiled, feeling a flutter in her chest. "That''s the goal." She handed him
  a fork, and he took a bite, his eyes closing in appreciation.


  As they ate together in the warm sunlight, Alejandro opened up about his grandmother,
  about the recipes she''d taught him, and the memories they''d shared. Maya listened,
  entranced, as the walls he''d built around himself began to crumble. She saw the
  vulnerability he kept hidden, the pain he''d endured.


  As the last bite was savored, Alejandro met her gaze, his eyes searching. "Thank
  you," he said, his voice low. "I haven''t had that in years." The words hung between
  them, a fragile connection.


  Maya''s heart swelled. She could leave now, with the money she''d earned, and try
  to save her grandmother''s restaurant another way. But something about Alejandro''s
  gaze made her want to stay, to be the one he trusted. "I''ll make it again," she
  said, her voice barely above a whisper.


  Alejandro''s eyes held hers, a spark of connection igniting. For a moment, they
  just looked at each other, the air thick with possibility. Then, without a word,
  he turned and walked away, leaving Maya to wonder if she''d imagined the entire
  moment.


  But she knew she hadn''t. She felt it, deep in her bones. She was in this now, not
  just for the money, but for Alejandro, for the connection they shared, and for the
  hope of something more.'
