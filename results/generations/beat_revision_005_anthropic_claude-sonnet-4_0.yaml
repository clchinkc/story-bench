  This segment properly executes the Dark Night of the Soul beat. It follows the major
  loss (gallery closure), shows Maya alone and isolated, captures genuine despair
  through her reflection on failing her mother''s legacy, avoids presenting solutions,
  and incorporates mortality themes through her mother''s death and the metaphorical
  "whiff of death" in phrases like letting "the silence swallow her whole." The emotional
  tone is appropriately quiet and internal, showing Maya at her most vulnerable moment
  before any potential breakthrough.'
