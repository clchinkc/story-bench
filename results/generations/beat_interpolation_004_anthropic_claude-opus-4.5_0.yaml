output: 'Thomas approached the witness stand slowly, buying himself time. Dr. Okonkwo
  wouldn''t meet his eyes.


  "Dr. Okonkwo, you previously provided my office with documents detailing Meridian''s
  internal review of adverse reactions. Do you stand by those documents?"


  Silence stretched through the courtroom. Her hands trembled in her lap.


  "I..." She glanced toward the defense table. "I may have misinterpreted certain
  data. The documents could be misleading without proper context."


  The words hit Thomas like a physical blow. Behind him, he heard whispers ripple
  through the gallery. The defense attorney leaned back, satisfied.


  Thomas could feel the case slipping away. Six days of work. Seventeen deaths. And
  a little girl who needed treatment her mother was being blackmailed with.


  He had two choices. Press harder, force her to commit to the lie under penalty of
  perjury. Watch her destroy herself to save her daughter. Or—


  "Dr. Okonkwo." Thomas stepped closer, lowering his voice so only she could hear.
  "I know about your daughter. I know what they offered you."


  Her eyes finally met his, wild with desperation.


  "I''m going to ask you one more question," he continued, barely above a whisper.
  "Before you answer, I need you to know—I will find another way. I swear to you.
  But I can''t save the next seventeen people alone."


  He stepped back, speaking clearly for the record now. "Dr. Okonkwo, when Meridian
  discovered that their drug caused fatal cardiac events in certain patients, what
  did they instruct you to do?"


  The courtroom held its breath. Dr. Okonkwo looked at Meridian''s CEO, at Thomas,
  at her own shaking hands.


  "They told me to bury it." The words came out cracked, broken. "They said the revenue
  projections couldn''t absorb a delay. So we—" Her voice caught. "We falsified the
  trial results. We knew people would die. We knew, and we did it anyway."


  The defense attorney shot to his feet, objecting, but it was too late. Dr. Okonkwo
  was reaching into her jacket, pulling out a flash drive she''d hidden despite everything.


  "The original data," she said, placing it on the witness stand. "All of it."


  Thomas took the drive, his hand steady even as his heart pounded. He turned to face
  the jury.


  "No further questions."'
