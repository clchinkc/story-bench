output: 'The morning after her grandmother’s ghost had appeared, Elena found herself
  standing outside *Marcus’s Oddities & Curiosities*, a crooked little shop wedged
  between the bakery and the blacksmith’s. The sign creaked in the wind, its paint
  peeling like old bandages. She hadn’t meant to come here—her feet had carried her
  while her mind still tangled in last night’s refusal. But the shop’s window display,
  cluttered with strange artifacts and yellowed scrolls, had snagged her attention
  like a book half-read.


  A bell jingled as she pushed inside. The air smelled of dried herbs and old parchment,
  thick enough to taste. Behind the counter, a man with a salt-and-pepper beard and
  a patch over one eye looked up from polishing a brass astrolabe. His remaining eye,
  sharp as a needle, fixed on her.


  “You’re the librarian,” he said. Not a question.


  Elena blinked. “How did you—?”


  “Your grandmother sent word.” He set down the astrolabe with a *clink*. “Name’s
  Marcus. And you’re here because you’re scared.”


  She bristled. “I’m not—”


  “Good.” He cut her off with a wave of his hand. “Fear’s useful. Means you’re paying
  attention.” He reached under the counter and slid a worn leather satchel across
  the wood. “Take this.”


  Elena hesitated. “What is it?”


  “Supplies. A compass that doesn’t lie, a tinderbox that won’t fail, and a few other
  things you’ll need.” He leaned forward, voice dropping. “The Thornwood doesn’t care
  if you’re a fighter or a sorcerer. It cares if you’re *observant*. And you, librarian,
  know how to read things others miss.”


  She frowned. “That’s just—”


  “Cataloging?” He smirked. “No. It’s pattern recognition. It’s knowing which details
  matter and which don’t. That’s half the battle in any journey.” He tapped the satchel.
  “The rest is trusting yourself enough to take the first step.”


  Elena’s fingers brushed the leather. The weight of it was surprising. “You’re not
  coming with me.”


  “No.” His voice was firm. “But I’m giving you what you need to go alone.” He straightened,
  suddenly serious. “Your grandmother saw something in you. So do I. Now it’s your
  turn.”


  Outside, the wind howled. Elena exhaled, her breath unsteady. The satchel felt heavier
  than it should. But for the first time since the map had appeared, the weight didn’t
  feel like a burden. It felt like a choice.'
