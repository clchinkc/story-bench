output: 'Zoe Chen, seventeen, had made the Millbrook Public Library her sanctuary.
  She spent her summers shelving books in the quiet stacks, disappearing into other
  people''s stories because her own felt too small, too uncertain to inhabit. She
  liked the predictability of the Dewey Decimal System, the way no one expected her
  to speak. The library asked nothing of her except presence, and presence she could
  manage. It was conversation that terrified her—the unpredictable back-and-forth,
  the weight of being heard.


  But safety, she was beginning to realize, had a cost. She watched patrons come and
  go, full of purpose, full of somewhere to be, while she remained static among the
  shelves. Something in her chest ached for more than alphabetizing spines. She wanted
  to matter to someone, to something, but wanting and reaching were different muscles,
  and she''d let one atrophy.


  Ms. Okafor, the new librarian, changed the equation. She announced a summer program:
  oral history interviews with Millbrook''s oldest residents. "Their stories deserve
  to be preserved," she said. When no one volunteered quickly enough, Ms. Okafor found
  Zoe hiding in the 900s. "I saw you reading Studs Terkel last week," she said, pressing
  a recorder into Zoe''s reluctant hands. "You understand why stories matter. Just
  one interview. Try."


  Zoe''s first subject was Bernard Park, eighty-nine, a Korean War veteran who''d
  lived in Millbrook for six decades. She arrived at his door with index cards and
  a hammering heart. The interview was awkward—long silences, fumbled questions, her
  voice barely above a whisper. The second attempt wasn''t better. Her mother kept
  asking when she''d get a real summer job. But Zoe returned to Bernard''s porch again
  and again, and somewhere around the fifth visit, the awkwardness began to thin.
  She stopped reading from her cards. She started listening—really listening—and discovered
  that listening required its own kind of courage. Bernard''s pauses held as much
  meaning as his words. The old man began to trust her with harder truths.


  Then came the revelation that changed everything. Bernard told her he''d never spoken
  about what really happened in Korea—the guilt he''d carried for sixty years, the
  friends he couldn''t save. "You''re the first person who ever asked the right questions,"
  he said. But he wanted his story shared publicly, at the town hall, where the whole
  community could hear. He wanted Zoe to tell it.


  She stood before a hundred strangers, the girl who rehearsed coffee orders, and
  gave voice to Bernard''s survival, his grief, his grace. Her hands shook. Her voice
  didn''t. When she finished, the room rose to its feet, but what Zoe remembered most
  was Bernard''s handshake afterward, his wet eyes. "You heard me," he said. "That''s
  all any of us want."


  The summer ended. The program concluded. Other volunteers scattered, but Zoe kept
  visiting Bernard''s porch, kept recording his stories, kept asking. When he passed
  in October, his family asked her to speak at the funeral. This time, she wasn''t
  carrying someone else''s truth—she was sharing her own. She told them what Bernard
  had taught her about listening, about the courage hidden in quiet attention, about
  how stories tether us to each other across time.


  Senior year, Zoe applied to journalism programs. Her essay was about Millbrook''s
  forgotten voices and the old man who taught a shy girl that hearing someone fully
  is its own act of love. She still rehearsed her coffee orders. She probably always
  would. But she could also stand before strangers and make them listen, make them
  feel, make them remember. That was the change Bernard had given her—not the absence
  of fear, but the presence of something stronger.'
