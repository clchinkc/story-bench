output: 'Yuki followed the corridor map toward crew quarters, scanner raised, cataloging
  the station’s atmosphere by habit: oxygen at 20.9%, CO₂ scrubbers nominal, trace
  organics slightly elevated as if something had outgassed and never been fully filtered.
  The doors to Section C stood open. Inside, bunks were neatly made, lockers half-latched,
  personal tablets abandoned on charging docks. A mug floated in a slow, lazy arc
  near the ceiling, rotating as if the gravity plating were intermittently forgetting
  its job.


  She caught it on reflex and felt the faint tremor in her wrist as gravity snapped
  back. The mug dropped, clinked once, and steadied on the floor. Her heart did not.


  On a wall display, an emergency log blinked in looping fragments. “—phase variance—”
  “—Subject stability at 0.3 seconds—” “—Reyes authorizes continuation—” The rest
  was corrupted, time stamps smeared.


  In the medical bay, the air was cooler. Autodocs sat idle with their arms folded
  like insects at rest. A gurney still held a stained restraint strap, the fabric
  scorched along one edge in a pattern too clean to be fire. Yuki ran her scanner
  over it; the readout spiked, then refused to resolve, as if the material’s density
  kept changing under observation.


  A whisper of static brushed her ear. She turned.


  At the far end of the bay, a distortion hung above the floor—heat-haze without heat,
  a human outline sketched by bending light. It twitched toward her. The room’s lights
  fluttered. Yuki’s throat tightened; she backed into the hallway, forcing herself
  to breathe on counts, to think in numbers.


  The shimmer followed, faster now, and the bay door slammed shut on its own with
  a metallic shriek. Her tablet chirped: power surge. Magnetic lock engaged.


  “Okay,” she told herself, voice low and clinical, as if naming the phenomenon would
  contain it. She popped the maintenance panel, rerouted the lock’s power through
  an emergency bypass, and bled charge from the circuit with her insulated tool. Sparks
  bit the air; the lock released with a reluctant click.


  The corridor beyond was darker, red-lit and pulsing. In the reflective surface of
  a viewport, she saw not one distortion but several, gathering at the edges of her
  vision like a crowd that refused to be looked at directly.


  A terminal in the junction alcove flashed a final message header—REYES, COMMAND—garbled
  except for one clear line: “Lab Seven. Core secure. Don’t—”


  Yuki swallowed, steadied her scanner, and started toward Lab Seven, each step measured
  against the rising certainty that the station was not empty at all.'
