output: 'The Grand Prix roar echoed across Monaco''s harbor as the Tsarina''s decks
  thrummed with champagne-fueled revelry. Miriam Delacroix adjusted her earring, a
  marvel of engineering that contained both a camera and an earbud, and surveyed her
  domain. The yacht sprawled before her—a cathedral of opulence where Russia''s finest
  had gathered to watch the race from water level while their protector, Viktor Sorokin,
  played the gracious host.


  "Blue team in position," Dex''s voice crackled. Her electronics specialist sat in
  a hired dinghy nearby, ready to flood the yacht''s security frequencies with a controlled
  electronic hum that would create perfect blindspots at precisely the right moments.


  Miri caught sight of Tasya threading through the crowd, playing her role as an enthusiastic
  art collector with effortless grace. The younger woman had stumbled into Miri''s
  world two years ago, recruited for her facility with languages and her desperate
  need for cash—her pregnant wife needed treatment that insurance wouldn''t cover.
  Since then, she''d proven herself repeatedly, though Miri still caught occasionally
  how Tasya looked at her, seeking approval that Miri found difficult to give.


  The plan was elegant in its simplicity. The painting—a Vermeer stolen from a Jewish
  family in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation—hung in Sorokin''s private study,
  accessible only through the main salon where the party raged. While Sorokin worked
  the room, his attention would be on Tasya, who had engineered an introduction through
  intermediaries. Miri would slip into the study, Dex would handle the security systems,
  and they''d exit through the service passage while everyone still thought the night
  was young.


  "Alpha approaching target," Miri murmured, moving toward the study door. She wore
  the confidence of a woman who had planned this for months, who knew exit routes
  and guard rotations and the precise curvature of each corridor.


  The door opened onto unexpected complication. A woman stood examining the Vermeer—tall,
  silver-haired, wearing silk that probably cost more than Miri''s apartment. Their
  eyes met in the reflection of the gilded frame.


  Elena Vasquez.


  The name hit Miri like cold water. Her former mentor. The woman who had framed her
  for theft eight years ago, destroying her career and reputation with surgical precision.
  The woman who had taught Miri everything she knew about art, security, and betrayal.


  "Miriam," Elena said, not turning from the painting. "I wondered when you''d come."


  Miri''s hand moved instinctively toward the door, but Elena''s smile stopped her.
  "Your little friend is charming Sorokin quite effectively. He''s already asked her
  to see his collection in Monaco. She''ll be occupied for some time."


  "What do you want?"


  "What I''ve always wanted, dear." Elena finally turned, her face unreadable. "To
  see you fail. But this time, I''m being paid rather well to ensure it." She gestured
  to the painting. "Forty million dollars, and the satisfaction of watching you lose
  everything again. Your choice, Miriam. Leave the painting and walk away with your
  crew intact. Or stay, and I expose every single one of them."


  Miri''s mind raced through escape routes, options, angles. The ventilation shaft
  above the desk—Dex had mapped it during reconnaissance. The service corridor. The
  emergency launch on the stern.


  "Take the painting," she said into her earpiece. "Get out. Now."


  "Miriam—"


  "That''s an order."


  She heard Dex''s sharp intake of breath, then the soft shuffle of movement. Tasya''s
  voice, tight with controlled fear: "We''re coming to you."


  "No. The service corridor. I''ll meet you at the dock." Miri was already moving,
  positioning herself between Elena and the door. "Get out. That''s an order."


  Elena laughed, genuine and cold. "You''re sacrificing everything for loyalty? You,
  who doesn''t trust anyone?"


  "Maybe I''m learning." Miri met her mentor''s eyes one last time. "Goodbye, Elena."


  She vanished into the corridor, footsteps silent on the plush carpet, the sound
  of the party fading behind her as the hunt began.'
