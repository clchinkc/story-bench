output: "Eleanor traced the manuscript’s title with a gloved finger, the ink smudged\
  \ as if her father had trembled while transcribing the horrors. The fog thickened,\
  \ swallowing the churchyard whole. “We’ll publish it,” she said, her voice steadier\
  \ than she felt.  \n\nThomas stiffened. “Miss Blackwood—”  \n\n“The printing house\
  \ is mine now. Not ‘we.’ *I* will decide.” She turned toward the iron gates, her\
  \ black gown dragging through mud. “Have the first chapter typeset by morning. We’ll\
  \ sell it as a penny dreadful—sensationalist, urgent. The people want blood, and\
  \ we’ll give them ink instead.”  \n\nHis footsteps hurried to match hers. “The police\
  \ constable’s widow lives two streets over. She’s been refused her husband’s pension.\
  \ Do you think this… *spectacle* won’t hurt those still grieving?”  \n\nEleanor\
  \ paused beneath the skeletal branches of a plane tree. She’d spent years in her\
  \ father’s shadow, listening to men debate morality over brandy while she poured\
  \ their drinks. Now she’d use their rules against them. “Would you rather we starve\
  \ quietly?”  \n\nThe printing house loomed ahead, its windows dark as closed eyes.\
  \ Thomas followed her inside, the air thick with the tang of lead type and lamp\
  \ oil. She lit a single candle, its flame flickering over rows of neglected presses.\
  \ “You know the business better than I. Stay and help me. Or go.”  \n\nHe didn’t\
  \ leave.  \n\n***  \n\nThey worked through the night.  \n\nThomas proved deft at\
  \ smoothing her father’s fevered prose into something marketable, while Eleanor\
  \ drafted a preface claiming the manuscript was “transcribed from the journals of\
  \ a constable’s widow,” a lie that made her stomach churn. By dawn, she’d bartered\
  \ with a newsboy gang to distribute the first edition along Fleet Street, their\
  \ urchin faces alight with the promise of coin.  \n\nBut the creditors came at noon.\
  \  \n\nMr. Grimsby, a loan shark with a limp and a lorgnette, tapped his walking\
  \ stick against the printing press. “Sensationalism won’t cover your debts, Miss\
  \ Blackwood. Unless you’ve found a gold mine in those Whitechapel tales.”  \n\n\
  “It’s not tales,” she said, sliding a proof copy into his hand. “It’s *gossip*.\
  \ The East End’s butcher has his admirers—men who’ll pay to thrill at his works.\
  \ Let them spend their wages here instead of on gin.”  \n\nGrimsby’s grin exposed\
  \ a tooth like a yellowed tombstone. “You’ll be cursed for this.”  \n\n“My father’s\
  \ corpse is cold. Let curses come.”  \n\nWhen they left, Thomas stared at the door\
  \ as if it might burst open again. “You’ve painted a target on us.”  \n\n“We’re\
  \ already painted. You said it yourself—this quarter reeks of desperation.” She\
  \ lifted a fresh sheet from the press, the paper still damp. The headline screamed:\
  \ *THE KNIFE BEHIND THE LACE*. “The Ripper’s a shadow. We’ve given him a voice.\
  \ Now we’ll see who’s brave enough to silence us.”  \n\n***  \n\nThe first death\
  \ threat arrived at dusk.  \n\nA boy no older than ten shoved a soot-smeared envelope\
  \ under the door. Inside, a single sentence: *Stop the presses or the blood will\
  \ be on your hands.*  \n\nThomas paled. “We should delay the printing.”  \n\nEleanor\
  \ fed the note to the lamp. “If we retreat now, the creditors will strip the presses\
  \ for scrap. The Ripper’s ghost is already in every cellar and alleyway. We’re simply\
  \ putting him to work.”  \n\nShe didn’t sleep that night. Instead, she combed the\
  \ manuscript for details her father had omitted—strange symbols scratched into walls,\
  \ whispers of a “Gentleman” who paid for silence. When Thomas arrived at dawn, she\
  \ thrust the pages at him. “There’s more to this than you’ve told me.”  \n\nHe hesitated,\
  \ then nodded. “Your father received a letter before he died. Sealed with red wax\
  \ shaped like a lion.”  \n\n“A lion?”  \n\n“A family crest. He burned the letter,\
  \ but I saw the emblem. It belongs to Lord Ashcroft.”  \n\nThe name coiled around\
  \ her throat. Ashcroft—a patron of the arts, a benefactor of orphanages. A man who\
  \ visited her late father twice a month to discuss “investments.”  \n\n“You think\
  \ he’s connected to the killings,” Thomas whispered.  \n\n“I think we’re no longer\
  \ merely printing stories,” Eleanor said, the truth as sharp as a guillotine’s drop.\
  \ “We’re digging into graves.”  \n\nBy morning, the first edition hit the streets.\
  \ Crowds gathered at Billingsgate Market, hands outstretched for the paper like\
  \ beggars at communion. Eleanor watched from the balcony, her father’s pocket watch\
  \ ticking beneath her glove—*tick, tick, tick*—until Thomas rushed in, breathless.\
  \  \n\n“Ashcroft’s solicitor is here.”  \n\nShe descended the stairwell slowly,\
  \ her boots echoing like a funeral march. The solicitor, a weasel-faced man with\
  \ a silver-tipped cane, waited in the lobby. “Lord Ashcroft insists you cease publication\
  \ immediately,” he said, offering a velvet-lined case. Inside glittered a thousand\
  \ pounds in gold. “He’s… fond of discretion.”  \n\nEleanor closed the case. “Tell\
  \ Lord Ashcroft the next edition prints Friday. And the one after that, and the\
  \ one after that.”  \n\nThe man’s smile vanished. “As you wish, Miss Blackwood.”\
  \  \n\nWhen he’d gone, Thomas gripped her arm. “He’ll ruin us.”  \n\n“No,” she said,\
  \ watching fog coil through the letterpress. “He’ll give us a reason to fight.”\
  \  \n\nOutside, the city roared with the sound of printers’ devils at their blocks,\
  \ and somewhere in the smog, a watchful eye began to blink."
