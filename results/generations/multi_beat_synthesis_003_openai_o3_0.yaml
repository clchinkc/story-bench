output: "A violinist on the upper deck sawed through Vivaldi while the Monaco Grand\
  \ Prix screamed along the harbor, which meant everyone on Viktor Sorokin’s yacht\
  \ attended to either engines or Champagne. Perfect camouflage. Miri, in a starched\
  \ steward’s jacket, glided among sequined elbows, topping off flutes with vintage\
  \ that cost more than her crew’s van. Each pour hid a data spike slid under the\
  \ base of the glass tables; Jules, hunched in the service galley, piggy-backed on\
  \ the yacht’s Wi-Fi through those spikes, teasing door locks one by one.  \n\n“Table\
  \ nine unlocked,” he breathed in her earpiece. “Also, Sorokin’s playlist is tragic.\
  \ I’m deleting ABBA.”  \n\n“Touch Waterloo and I fire you mid-sea,” Miri murmured,\
  \ lips never leaving her professional smile.  \n\nBelow, Carmen—her gymnast in a\
  \ cocktail dress—slipped through the maintenance shaft Miri had mapped weeks ago,\
  \ a ribbon of steel that bypassed the motion detectors but required a five-second\
  \ hold on the stabilizer fins or the whole yacht would lurch. They’d timed it to\
  \ the moment the Red Bull car took the chicane; crowd roar neatly masked the metallic\
  \ groan. Up top, the guests simply toasted the overtake.  \n\nInside the private\
  \ gallery Carmen popped the case screws with manicure tools, revealing Titian’s\
  \ Saint Catherine, lifted by the Nazis in ’43. She fed its dimensions to Jules.\
  \ He answered with the locations of every roaming guard, plus the lull—they had\
  \ exactly one minute every fifteen when the yacht’s anti-drone jammer rebooted to\
  \ handshake with race-control frequencies. Miri called it their skylight, and she\
  \ intended to fly a carbon-fiber courier drone right through it.  \n\nMinor snag:\
  \ a guard decided to admire the painting in person. Carmen froze, half a frame in\
  \ hand. Miri pivoted, spilled Champagne artfully on his shoes, and steered him toward\
  \ a cleaning closet with an apology so sincere it deserved an award. The plan, otherwise,\
  \ purred forward.\n\n\n\nThe painting now rested in a smoked-glass trophy tube,\
  \ disguised as the commemorative cup Sorokin meant to present after dusk. Miri accepted\
  \ nods from staff as she carried it toward the rear deck, adrenaline humming like\
  \ the race cars ashore. Success tasted like salt and engine fumes.  \n\nThen the\
  \ yacht’s video wall lit with a security briefing: Sorokin, crimson from sun and\
  \ vodka, clapped beside a poised woman in a silver jumpsuit. Eleonora Vasquez. Mentor,\
  \ betrayer, the architect of the museum heist that ruined Miri’s life.  \n\n“New\
  \ precaution,” Eleonora announced to the party, voice as smooth as lacquer. “A demonstration\
  \ of response time.” She gestured; bulkhead doors slid shut across every corridor.\
  \ False victory shattered: they had the prize but nowhere to go.  \n\nJules whispered,\
  \ “She wrote the protocols I cloned. She’ll spot the fingerprints.” On-screen schematics\
  \ spiraled, highlighting an unscheduled data spike—Miri’s Champagne glasses. Eleonora\
  \ smirked, eyes raking the crowd the way a hawk seeks shimmer in grass. Miri turned\
  \ her face, but recognition flared; even across the room she felt it.  \n\n“Plan\
  \ just changed,” she said. “We’re not the hunters anymore.” Outside, fireworks tests\
  \ cracked over the harbor, reflecting off the yacht’s mirrored windows. The same\
  \ thirty-second jammer reboot—now a countdown to either escape or exposure. And\
  \ amid the applause, Sorokin slipped a pistol to his bodyguard. The party’s glamour\
  \ curdled into theater lights aimed at them.\n\n\n\nSirens howled from pier patrol\
  \ boats; Eleonora must have tipped local police to a “credible theft attempt.” Guards\
  \ tightened rings deck by deck. Jules’s voice quavered: “They’re tracing signal\
  \ origination. I’m two steps from a hard shut-down.”  \n\n“Hold the skylight open,”\
  \ Miri ordered, advancing through the service corridor with the trophy tube. Carmen’s\
  \ line crackled but gave no sound. Cameras showed her cornered near the stabilizer\
  \ shaft by two guards and Sorokin’s lumbering bodyguard, the pistol now out.  \n\
  \nJules: “We ditch the painting and exfiltrate. No art is worth Carmen.”  \n\nMiri’s\
  \ pulse hammered. She remembered Eleonora teaching her the calculus of loss: objects\
  \ endure, people complicate. Eleonora would sacrifice Carmen without blinking—Miri\
  \ refused to. Yet returning Saint Catherine to its Amsterdam family was the mission,\
  \ the atonement.  \n\nShe unclipped the drone pack from her belt—a beetle-slick\
  \ device whose use depended on the jammer’s reboot window she had joked about earlier.\
  \ Chekhov’s skylight. “Jules, thirty seconds of blue sky. Now.”  \n\n“Already cycling,”\
  \ he said, terrified and loyal.  \n\nMiri sprinted onto the aft deck as window shutters\
  \ slammed elsewhere. Wind whipped her jacket; luxury yachts glittered like teeth\
  \ across black water. She attached the tube to the drone’s magnetic claws, keyed\
  \ the Dutch address, and waited. Ten seconds. Voices pounded toward her, Eleonora’s\
  \ among them, cool and certain: “Miriam, you always did prefer the dramatic exit.”\
  \  \n\nEight seconds. The jammer blinked off. She launched. The drone shot upward\
  \ through the invisible curtain just as the signal wall roared back to life. Painting\
  \ gone, destiny airborne.  \n\nMiri pivoted, hands raised, intercepting Eleonora’s\
  \ cold stare. “Now you’ve got me,” she said, surrendering to buy Jules and Carmen\
  \ time. Gallows humor tasted bitter, but the choice felt clean: art could fly to\
  \ freedom; revenge could wait for another race."
