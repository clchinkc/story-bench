output: "Thomas stood, his legs feeling like lead. \"Dr. Okonkwo,\" he began, his\
  \ voice echoing in the vaulted room. \"Did you oversee the final safety audit for\
  \ the Meridian trials?\"\n\nPatricia’s hands were white-knuckled on the railing.\
  \ She glanced toward the defense table, where the CEO’s gaze was a physical weight.\
  \ \"I... I oversaw the initial phases. The final audit was handled by committee.\"\
  \n\n\"And that committee found no significant adverse reactions?\"\n\n\"That is...\"\
  \ She swallowed hard, her eyes darting to the gallery. \"That is what the official\
  \ record reflects.\"\n\nA murmur rippled through the court. She was recanting. The\
  \ foundation of Thomas’s case was crumbling in real-time. He saw his father’s jaw\
  \ tighten. If he didn't act now, the seventeen deaths would be buried forever under\
  \ the weight of a corporate bribe.\n\nThomas stepped out from behind the podium,\
  \ moving into the well of the court until he was inches from the witness stand.\
  \ He was breaking every rule of distance, but the judge remained frozen. \n\n\"\
  Patricia,\" he said, dropping the formal title. He reached into his pocket and pulled\
  \ out a small, laminated prayer card—one he’d taken from the memorial of the youngest\
  \ victim, an eight-year-old boy. He laid it face down on the ledge of the witness\
  \ box, where only she could see it. \"I know about the offer. I know what they’re\
  \ holding over you.\"\n\nThe defense erupted in objections. The judge banged his\
  \ gavel, shouting for order, but Thomas didn't flinch. \n\nHe leaned closer, his\
  \ voice a low, jagged rasp. \"If you lie for them to save your daughter, you'll\
  \ be giving her a future built on the graves of seventeen others. Is that the mother\
  \ you want her to remember?\" He lowered his voice even further. \"Testify. I will\
  \ find another way for her. I swear it on my father’s name.\"\n\nThe room was a\
  \ chaos of noise, but Patricia was staring at the back of that card. The silence\
  \ between them was a vacuum. She looked up at the CEO, and for the first time, the\
  \ fear in her eyes crystallized into a cold, sharp defiance.\n\n\"The official record\
  \ is a forgery,\" she said, her voice cutting through the judge's gavel like a blade.\
  \ \"I have the original logs. I kept them because I knew this day would come.\"\n\
  \nThe tension in the room snapped. Thomas exhaled, a sound of pure exhaustion, as\
  \ the truth finally spilled into the light."
