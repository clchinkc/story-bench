output: 'Thomas rose, file in hand, the weight of six days and seventeen lost lives
  pressing against his spine. “Dr. Okonkwo,” he began, voice even, “please state your
  position at Meridian Pharmaceuticals.”


  She folded her hands to keep them from shaking. “Former head of clinical research.”


  “Did you oversee the Phase III trials for Remetyx?”


  A beat. “Yes.” Her stare drifted to the defense table; Meridian’s CEO inclined his
  head, a subtle reminder.


  Thomas continued. “Directing your attention to Exhibit 42—the internal safety memo
  you authored—can you confirm it warns of fatal arrhythmias in twenty-three percent
  of test subjects?”


  Her eyes locked on the page as though it were a noose. “I… don’t recall writing
  that.”


  Silence rippled through the courtroom. Thomas felt his pulse throb in his ears.
  Recantation had begun.


  He inhaled, then made his choice. “Your Honor, permission to treat the witness as
  hostile.”


  The judge nodded. “Granted.”


  Thomas stepped closer, lowering his voice to something only she could hear. “Patricia,
  seventeen families are sitting behind me. They deserve the truth. And your daughter
  deserves a mother she can respect.”


  She flinched. A tear welled but did not fall.


  Aloud he read from her sworn deposition: “‘Meridian suppressed mortality data to
  accelerate FDA approval.’ Is that your statement?”


  Her mouth opened, closed. Defense counsel rose—“Objection, badgering”—but the judge
  waved him down.


  Thomas placed another sheet on the rail: a photo of Miguel Alvarez, age fourteen,
  one of the dead. Beside it, unseen by the jury, he slipped a business card toward
  her—Johns Hopkins Pediatric Oncology, Trial Coordinator—silent promise that hope
  existed outside Meridian’s grasp.


  Dr. Okonkwo’s shoulders sagged. She lifted the memo with steady fingers. “I recognize
  this document,” she said, voice gaining volume. “My signature is here. Meridian
  knew Remetyx was lethal and ordered me to falsify data.”


  Gasps burst in the gallery. Thomas seized the moment. “And who gave that order?”


  She pointed to the CEO. “He did.”


  The defense table erupted with objections; the judge’s gavel hammered them down.
  Thomas entered the memo and her deposition into evidence. The record now bore an
  unbroken chain from corporate deception to the graves of seventeen patients.


  When he returned to counsel’s table, Thomas’s legs threatened to give way, but the
  verdict—in that instant—was no longer uncertain. The truth, wrested from fear, now
  sat plainly before twelve stunned jurors, impossible to ignore.'
