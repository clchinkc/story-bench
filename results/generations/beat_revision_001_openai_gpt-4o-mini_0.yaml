output: "Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling\
  \ hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,\
  \ exactly as the prophecies had described.\n\n\"You cannot defeat me, child,\" the\
  \ dragon rumbled. \"Stronger warriors have tried, and their failures haunt their\
  \ kin.\"\n\nKira thought of her village, of her brother's lifeless body, and the\
  \ guilt that had crushed her spirit. She raised her sword and charged, determination\
  \ battling the fear that threatened to consume her.\n\nThe battle was brutal. Flame\
  \ scorched her armor as she fought to push back the memories. Claws raked across\
  \ her shield, and she felt the weight of despair pushing down on her. Three times\
  \ she was knocked down, her body aching with defeat, and three times she rose again,\
  \ driven by the memory of her brother's last smile.\n\nBut with each blow, the dragon's\
  \ taunts pierced her heart deeper. \"You will join him soon,\" it hissed, igniting\
  \ the flame of her guilt. Just as the darkness threatened to swallow her, she found\
  \ a flicker of defiance. She could not let her brother's death be in vain.\n\nFinally,\
  \ when the dragon overextended on a strike, she saw her opening. With the last of\
  \ her strength, she drove her sword through the gap in its scales, piercing its\
  \ heart. \n\nThe Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar. Kira stood\
  \ over its body, victorious yet trembling, the weight of the battle lifting as she\
  \ gasped for breath. \n\n\"I did it,\" she whispered, a surge of clarity washing\
  \ over her. \"I did it for him.\"\n\nShe retrieved her sword and began the long\
  \ walk back to camp, ready to tell the others the good news—transformed, carrying\
  \ her brother’s memory as strength instead of sorrow."
