output: 'The Tsarina’s deck bloomed like a night garden, candles and chrome catching
  the race lights that pulsed in time with the distant engines. Miriam Delacroix—Miri
  to those who didn’t deserve her surname—stood at the rail with a flute of champagne
  that tasted like money and lies. She wore a dress the color of museum velvet and
  a smile that didn’t touch her eyes. Around her, the party swirled: Russian oligarchs,
  Monaco’s glossy underbelly, and the kind of people who kept their real names in
  encrypted folders. She’d spent a week memorizing the layout of Viktor Sorokin’s
  private collection, the guards’ rotations, and the exact varnish signature of the
  Renaissance painting that belonged to the Goldmans of Amsterdam. Tonight she intended
  to give it back.


  Her crew moved like music. Lin, the hacker with neon nails and a watch that hummed
  quietly, had already slipped into the yacht’s network through a “mandatory firmware
  update” notification on a tablet left by a bartender who had never existed. Jules,
  the con artist, wore a tuxedo tailored to cause accidents and a grin that made security
  officers forget their own names. Soraya, a former gymnast turned rope artist, had
  already mapped the rigging with her eyes, calculating angles and exits with the
  same precision she’d once used on uneven bars. The plan was simple: Jules would
  create a harmless catastrophe, Lin would open the doors, Soraya would swing, and
  Miri would walk out with the painting like a woman who belonged anywhere she chose.


  She sipped, watched, and waited. The lights dimmed for the anthem of speed, the
  sea glittering like a spilled bag of diamonds. Jules bumped into a waiter carrying
  a tower of champagne flutes. The crash was a percussion note in the orchestra of
  the party. Glass glittered, shouts rose, and a river of bubbles flooded the polished
  deck. Security stepped forward, hands hovering over earpieces, eyes scanning for
  chaos. Lin’s fingers danced on her watch face, and a door in the corridor beyond
  the gallery clicked open with the soft sigh of expensive hinges. Soraya’s eyes met
  Miri’s. A smile tugged at the corner of Miri’s mouth.


  She stepped away from the rail, her heels clicking like a metronome. The corridor
  was a vein of quiet amid the party’s pulse. She slipped into the gallery, past a
  marble bust that looked like it had been carved by someone who believed in gods.
  The painting hung in a gilded frame that had seen better centuries. The surface
  was glossy, the varnish a little too fresh, the brushwork too confident for the
  period it claimed. Miri’s fingers brushed the canvas. She felt the ghost of a signature
  and the memory of a theft that had made her name into a warning. She lifted the
  painting from its moorings, slid it into a case lined with acid-free cloth, and
  tucked the case under her arm.


  A voice cut through the air, crisp and familiar, a scalpel wrapped in velvet. “Careful
  with the varnish,” it said. “And with your hands.” Miri froze. She didn’t turn.
  She didn’t need to. The voice belonged to the woman who had taught her how to read
  paintings and how to break hearts. Eleanor Voss—her former mentor, her betrayer,
  her ghost—stood somewhere behind her, unseen but present like humidity before a
  storm. Miri’s breath hitched. She had prepared for many things, but not for the
  taste of old wounds.


  She walked, the case tucked close, her steps measured. The corridor opened onto
  the deck where Jules was still orchestrating apologies and flutes. Soraya had already
  disappeared into the rigging, a shadow climbing toward the second level. Lin gave
  Miri a nod that said all was well and nothing was safe. Miri’s mind spun. Eleanor’s
  presence changed the calculus. It made the game personal in a way that felt like
  sand in her teeth. She thought of the Goldmans and their letters, of the decades
  they had spent writing to museums and courts. She thought of revenge, sweet and
  slow, and of the painting that needed to go home.


  She reached the rail, the case pressed to her side, and saw the lights of the race
  sweep across the water in a bright ribbon. Somewhere in the crowd, Eleanor watched.
  The party pressed in, laughter like champagne, the scent of salt and money. Miri
  felt the familiar thrill of a plan executed, and the new, sharper thrill of an enemy
  revealed. She lifted her glass, sipped, and smiled. She was still ahead.


  The autopilot engaged with a soft chime, the Tsarina sliding a few degrees to starboard,
  aligning with the race route as the crowd cheered. Jules slipped a lanyard from
  his neck, a faux-credential that had gotten him past three checkpoints, and handed
  it to Soraya with a wink. “Emergency line,” he said, his voice low. “If you need
  it.” Soraya looped it around a cleat, testing the knot with professional indifference.
  “I won’t,” she said. “But I’ll remember.” The lanyard hung there, a bright red thread
  in the elegant chaos.


  Miri’s phone buzzed. A text from Lin: Autopilot shift in sixty seconds. The yacht
  would move again at midnight to avoid congestion near the pier. It was a detail
  she had noted and discarded, a piece of trivia in a sea of data. She filed it away
  and kept walking.


  The champagne river had been mopped, the crisis contained. Security relaxed, then
  stiffened again as a new voice crackled in their earpieces. The voice was precise,
  authoritative, and carried the weight of years. “Check the gallery,” it said. “And
  the rigging. Don’t trust the pretty ones.” Eleanor’s voice, unmistakable, issuing
  orders like a general on a battlefield that smelled of perfume. Miri felt her pulse
  rise. She had known this moment would come, but knowing and feeling were different
  animals. She glanced at Jules, who had gone still, his grin replaced by a calculating
  look. “We need to move,” he said. “Now.”


  She nodded. The case was heavy with history. She thought of the Goldmans and of
  Eleanor, of the painting and of revenge, of the sea and of the lights. The autopilot
  chime sounded again, softer this time, the Tsarina adjusting course with mechanical
  grace. The crowd shifted, the party eddying toward the rail as the yacht turned,
  the lights painting the deck in slow arcs. Miri stepped into the motion, using the
  movement as cover. Soraya dropped from the rigging, landing light as a cat. Jules
  melted into the crowd, his tuxedo a shadow among shadows. Lin’s watch face showed
  a map of the yacht’s systems, green lights winking like stars.


  They had the painting. They had the exit. They had the plan. They had Eleanor. Miri
  smiled, sharp and cold. She was still ahead, but the race had just gotten interesting.
