output: 'Sarah stared at the dead phone. Seventy-two hours. The photograph lay on
  her kitchen counter—Amy''s terrified eyes, the zip ties biting into her wrists.
  Recanting was the simplest path. One statement, a few words of doubt, and Amy might
  walk free. But Vincent Marchetti would too, and the body count from his retribution
  would make the original murder look like a traffic stop. She''d spent three years
  building this case. Recanting wasn''t just wrong; it was a blood sacrifice to a
  monster.


  She grabbed her phone and dialed Marcus Webb, her partner of eight years. He answered
  on the second ring, voice thick with sleep. "Sarah? It''s three AM."


  "Amy''s been taken. Marchetti''s people." She laid out the facts like a case file:
  the photo, the call, the demand. "I need to bring in the captain, get task force
  resources—"


  "Sarah, stop." Marcus''s voice dropped. "You know the department''s got leaks. We
  traced two witnesses'' addresses last month—both got torched before we could move
  them. If you go official, you light a beacon on Amy''s location. They want you to
  run to us. It''s what they''d expect."


  The silence stretched between them. Duty versus blood. Badge versus sister. Every
  cop oath she''d ever taken warred with the memory of Amy teaching her to ride a
  bike, Amy calling her hero when she made detective.


  "There''s a third way," Marcus said quietly. "Go dark. Use the contacts we''ve cultivated—the
  ones that don''t exist in any report. I can feed you intel, off the books. But you
  have to cut the cord. They can''t track what isn''t there."


  Sarah looked at her badge on the counter, catching the dim light. As a cop, she
  was a known quantity, predictable, bound. As a ghost, she was unpredictable. Dangerous.
  The rules that protected her had become the bars of Amy''s cage.


  "I''ll need the list," she said. "Everything off-record."


  "You''ll have it by dawn."


  She hung up and reached for a notepad, already calculating which favors to call,
  which lines to cross. The resignation letter would write itself. The system couldn''t
  save Amy—but a rogue detective with nothing to lose just might.'
