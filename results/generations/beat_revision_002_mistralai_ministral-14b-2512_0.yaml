output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, her voice trembling.


  Marcus looked up at her, then back at the notice. "We tried everything. The fundraiser?
  Cancelled—no sponsors left. The grant? Rejected yesterday. Even the church offered
  us two weeks in their basement, but that''s not a home for these kids."


  Denise swallowed hard. "What about the legal appeal? We still have time—"


  "Denise." His voice was raw. "The lawyer said the paperwork was ironclad. We lost
  before we even started." He rubbed his temples, the weight of it crushing him. "The
  board meeting tonight? They''re not coming. Half already quit. The rest... they''re
  scared."


  His phone buzzed—a text from his wife: *"Don''t worry, honey. We''ll figure this
  out together."* He stared at it, then at Denise. "She doesn’t understand. No one
  does."


  Denise’s hands shook as she set down her coffee. "I’m sorry, Marcus. I really tried."


  He looked at her, really looked. The betrayal hit him like a punch. "You knew. About
  the grant. You said we’d hear back next week."


  Her eyes flicked away. "I thought we had a chance."


  The silence between them was suffocating. The community center, the kids, his marriage—all
  of it slipping through his fingers. There was nothing left. No board. No funds.
  No home.


  Marcus stood slowly, the chair scraping against the floor. "I need to be alone."


  Denise didn’t stop him. Didn’t offer another word. The door clicked shut behind
  him, and for the first time in years, Marcus was truly alone.'
