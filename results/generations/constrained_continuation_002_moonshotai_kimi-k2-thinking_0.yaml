output: 'The "disaster" post exploded. Within an hour, curious foodies descended on
  the pink bus, phones out, demanding the controversial paneer tacos. Priya''s hands
  flew, slapping spiced paneer onto griddles while Dev frantically scribbled orders
  on sticky notes. Their first real customer—a tattooed line cook from a nearby restaurant—posted
  a TikTok of cheese stretching improbably from tortilla to mouth, captioned "Actually
  fire tho." It hit ten thousand views in twenty minutes.


  "Three tikka masala brisket tacos!" Dev yelled, shoving tickets onto the prep board.


  "That''s not a thing!" Priya shouted back, already shredding brisket.


  "Well it is now!" They locked eyes, and for the first time that day, Dev''s grin
  matched hers. He''d reorganized the entire service window into a functional chaos,
  his corporate efficiency finally finding its purpose. She tossed him a fresh tortilla;
  he caught it mid-air and started building an off-menu special. Their rhythm found
  them.


  By sunset, twenty people had become fifty. Then someone pointed across the street.


  "Smokey Joe''s BBQ" gleamed in pristine silver, its owner—a man built like a propane
  tank—leaning against his window, arms crossed. His scowl deepened as their line
  blocked his usual foot traffic. Priya waved. He didn''t wave back.


  At 8 PM, they sold out. Dev counted the cash while Priya collapsed onto a crate,
  smelling of cumin and victory. The blogger returned, camera ready. "Okay, I was
  wrong. This is genius. Championship material."


  When the last customer left, Dev handed Priya a beer. "We made three grand. In one
  day." They clinked bottles, laughing at the absurdity. For a moment, the pink bus
  felt like a rocket ship, not a disaster.


  Then Smokey Joe approached, his boots crunching gravel. "Cute circus you got here,"
  he drawled. "Enjoy it while it lasts. City permit office is doing a sweep next week.
  This spot''s grandfathered to me—my uncle owns the lot. Y''all are squatting." He
  tapped their permit sticker with a thick finger. "That temp tag? Expires Friday.
  Championship requires verified location permits." He walked away, whistling.


  Dev''s smile vanished. Priya stared at their permit—flapping loosely, barely attached.
  Their entire dream hinged on a piece of paper they''d secured through a rushed online
  application. The championship, the truck, their escape from corporate life—all of
  it now hung by a thread thinner than their first day''s profit. '
