output: "The Buckingham Hotel’s peeling lobby hummed with the static of a hundred\
  \ lifetimes. Dante Reyes traced the cracked marble floor where Rosa’s violet grief\
  \ had bled into the tiles. Before he could linger, a flicker of silver caught his\
  \ eye—a woman in a moth-eaten coat materialized from shadows, her arms crossed.\
  \  \n\n“Rosa trusted you,” Mira said, her voice blade-sharp. “Stupid, considering\
  \ you nearly OD’d in this hallway last year.”  \n\nDante flinched. “I’m not that\
  \ guy anymore.”  \n\n“Prove it.” She tossed him a rusted key. “Third-floor linen\
  \ closet. Open it.”  \n\nInside, the air reeked of mold and ozone. Dante’s vision\
  \ blurred as spectral hands clawed at him—Rosa’s final moments, her light siphoned\
  \ into a swirling void. He staggered, but the key burned cold in his fist, grounding\
  \ him. When he blinked, numerals glowed on the closet wall: *12-24-17*. Rosa’s death\
  \ date.  \n\n“They’re planting fake residues to flush out allies,” Dante muttered.\
  \ “The traitor’s in the group texts. We need to trap them tonight.”  \n\nMira’s\
  \ scowl softened. “You’re not the only one who owes her.”  \n\n---  \n\nThe abandoned\
  \ St. Agnes Clinic loomed like a buried secret. Dante’s boot crunched syringes as\
  \ he and Mira descended into the sub-basement, where flickering bulbs revealed a\
  \ mural he’d painted as a junkie: a phoenix drowning in black ink.  \n\n“Clean break,”\
  \ he said, tearing a shard of mirror from the wall. “Rosa taught me to channel pain\
  \ into focus.” He traced the glass with ash, creating a lens to magnify emotional\
  \ imprints.  \n\nMira handed him a vial of mercury-like liquid—the killer’s residue,\
  \ stolen from a victim’s apartment. “If you’re right about this leading to the Source…”\
  \  \n\n“I am.” Dante’s throat tightened. The date on the closet wall matched his\
  \ sister’s overdose. Coincidence. Probably.  \n\nAt the Buckingham’s threshold,\
  \ the air thickened with dread. Mira gripped his arm. “Last chance to run.”  \n\n\
  He stepped into the vortex of screaming colors.  \n\n---  \n\nThe killer waited\
  \ in Rosa’s suite, their face a melting clock of shifting features—Mira’s eyes,\
  \ Rosa’s voice, his sister’s smile.  \n\n“Petra,” Dante breathed. His sister’s dealer,\
  \ thought dead.  \n\n“You kept painting after you quit,” Petra hissed, tendrils\
  \ of black matter lashing. “Art *was* your drug. You understand.”  \n\nDante’s mirror\
  \ shard cracked as he deflected a strike. “She wasn’t my muse. She was my wake-up\
  \ call.”  \n\nPetra lunged, the room dissolving into a flashback: his sister’s blue\
  \ lips, his own trembling hands reaching too late. The void swallowed him—then Mira’s\
  \ shout pierced through.  \n\n“*The date!*”  \n\nRealization hit. *12-24-17*—not\
  \ Rosa’s death date, but the day she’d lied to protect the traitor. Dante plunged\
  \ the key into Petra’s chest, not to kill, but to *unlock*. The killer screamed\
  \ as Rosa’s stolen light erupted, searing Petra into ash.  \n\nDante collapsed,\
  \ the mirror reflecting his sister’s ghost. Not a memory—*a choice*. He closed his\
  \ eyes, letting the phoenix in his mural ignite.  \n\nWhen he opened them, the hotel’s\
  \ residue was clear. Mira nodded.  \n\n“Ready to clean this place up?”  \n\nHe pocketed\
  \ the key. “Yeah.”"
