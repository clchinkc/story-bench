output: 'The processing station smelled like recycled air and fear. Jin stood in line
  with forty others—refugees, dissidents, defectors—watching guards in silver suits
  catalog their histories like spare parts. When his turn came, the officer barely
  glanced at his credentials before waving him through to a narrow corridor lined
  with identical doors.


  His assigned quarters were smaller than his university dorm had been: a cot, a screen
  displaying orientation materials, the hum of ventilation that never quite stopped.
  Through the porthole, Earth hung like an accusation.


  He was still unpacking when someone knocked.


  The woman who entered was perhaps sixty, with close-cropped silver hair and the
  deliberate movements of someone who''d spent decades in low gravity. "Keiko Tanaka.
  I run the technical integration program." She didn''t ask permission to sit. "You''re
  the carbon capture whistleblower."


  "News travels fast."


  "The Collective is three stations with ten thousand people. Everything travels fast."
  Keiko studied him with unsettling clarity. "The Council sent interrogation queries
  within six hours of your arrival. They''re motivated. Either you''re important,
  or you know something they''re terrified others will find out."


  Over the following days, Keiko became his guide through the Collective''s bewildering
  politics. The stations operated on consensus committees that debated everything
  from water rationing to supply contracts. Unlike Earth''s centralized power, decisions
  moved glacially but included the people affected. It was exhausting and impossibly
  complicated—nothing like the streamlined authority Jin had lived under. Yet it meant
  something. Power here had to be earned rather than inherited.


  Keiko brought him to the research archive, showed him how to access materials restricted
  on Earth. That''s where he found it. Buried in technical submissions from a researcher
  named Dmitri Korsakov, dated eight months before the breakthrough announcement:
  the actual carbon capture algorithm. Not a prototype. Something finished. Something
  that worked at scale.


  "They didn''t suppress it because it was too radical," Jin said, his voice hollow.
  "They suppressed it because someone already solved it. Someone down there beat the
  Global Council''s own researchers."


  Keiko didn''t look surprised. "Korsakov published from Moscow Station before he
  disappeared. Probably dead. When you threaten the wrong people with too much evidence,
  the Collective''s no-extradition policy has limits."


  Jin felt the conspiracy suddenly expand beyond what he''d imagined. The Council
  hadn''t just hidden a breakthrough—they''d erased the person who achieved it. Every
  layer he pulled back revealed something worse beneath.


  "I can help you broadcast this," Keiko said quietly. "Get the real data out where
  Earth''s governments can''t contain it. But you have to understand what you''re
  choosing. Once you do this, you''re not a refugee anymore. You''re a combatant."


  "I''m already a combatant."


  "Not like this. Right now you can still disappear into the Collective. Thousands
  do. But if you publish Korsakov''s work, identify what really happened, you make
  yourself a target. The Council will advocate for your arrest, exile, maybe worse.
  The other stations will have pressure applied. Your safety here becomes conditional
  on whether you''re worth the trouble."


  Jin thought of his parents undergoing questioning. Yuna vanishing into some detention
  facility. The knowledge that his leak had mattered but not enough—that bigger truths
  were still buried.


  "Do it," he said.


  Keiko helped him prepare the files, compress the data, route it through anonymous
  channels to journalists across three continents. They worked through the night cycle,
  Jin''s hands shaking as he verified each document. By dawn, Korsakov''s algorithm
  was gone from secure servers and living in the wild internet, impossible to contain.


  Within hours, the Collective''s leadership called for Jin''s restriction. Safety,
  they said. Until questions were answered. Until the political temperature cooled.


  He was confined to the research sector now, his credentials suspended. The Collective
  had given him refuge and taken it back. He''d won a platform and lost his freedom
  to use it. As he watched Earth turn below through the research station''s viewport,
  Jin realized this was the real cost of resistance—not the obvious sacrifices, but
  the ones that came with every choice.'
