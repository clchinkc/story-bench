output: 'Jin stepped through the airlock into Prom Station''s main concourse, and
  immediately felt like an outsider. The Collective wasn''t what he''d imagined. Instead
  of the radical freedom he''d expected, he found a complex web of competing factions
  navigating careful hierarchies. Workers in different-colored jumpsuits moved through
  corridors in patterns he couldn''t read, conversations dropping to whispers as they
  passed him.


  "Looking for someone to explain how things actually work?"


  An older woman with close-cropped silver hair leaned against a maintenance hatch,
  watching him with knowing eyes. Her jumpsuit bore no faction markings.


  "I''m Kiran. I was a climate negotiator for the Indian Coalition before I came up
  here. You''ve got that look—new arrival, still thinking the Collective is some kind
  of utopia."


  Jin''s suspicion warred with his desperate need for guidance. "How do I know I can
  trust you?"


  "You don''t." She pushed off from the hatch. "But you need help, and I''m offering.
  The Collective has seventeen autonomous stations, each with its own governance council.
  You''re a political refugee from Earth—that makes you valuable and dangerous simultaneously.
  Various factions will want to use you, exploit you, or eliminate you as a liability."


  She led him through maintenance tunnels, explaining the unspoken rules of this new
  world. The Collective appeared unified in its defiance of Earth, but beneath the
  surface, deep divisions ran. Some stations prioritized industrial mining operations.
  Others focused on research. Still others served as waypoints for smuggling routes—not
  just goods, but people fleeing terrestrial persecution.


  "The Sustainability Council isn''t your only enemy," Kiran warned. "Some of us have
  been fighting this battle for years. We tried working within the system—peaceful
  protests, scientific publications, diplomatic pressure. Earth''s governments crushed
  us. That''s why we''re here."


  They emerged into a smaller station hidden behind Prom Station''s industrial layer.
  Kiran''s quarters were sparse,功能性, lined with physical books—a surprising rarity
  in space.


  "You''ve got the documents," she said without preamble. "The proof of suppression.
  We''ve been trying to expose the Council for years, but without undeniable evidence,
  we looked like conspiracy theorists. Your leak changes everything."


  Jin felt a flicker of hope for the first time since his hearing. "Then I can work
  with your communications team. Get the story out. Build support for—"


  "It''s not that simple." Kiran''s expression darkened. "We have something else too.
  Something you don''t know about."


  She pulled up a holographic display—technical schematics Jin recognized instantly.
  His heart stopped.


  "That''s Han''s research. The carbon capture breakthrough. But that''s impossible—the
  Council destroyed all—"


  "They destroyed the public copies." Kiran''s voice was flat. "We intercepted a classified
  shipment three years ago. We''ve had the technology all along."


  Jin stared at the schematics, the implications crashing over him. "Then why haven''t
  you released it? Do you have any idea how many people die each year from pollution-related
  illness? How many ecosystems collapse?"


  "Because Earth would bury it again. The same way they buried your leak." She shut
  off the display. "The Collective has been waiting for the right moment. Your leak
  gave us that moment. Now we can release both—the technology and proof that the Council
  suppressed it. The timing is perfect for maximum political impact."


  Jin felt sick. "You''re weaponizing humanitarian technology. Using it as leverage
  instead of just helping people."


  "We''re being pragmatic. If we release the technology quietly, Earth governments
  will suppress it within a year. We need a catalyst—something that forces global
  transparency before they can react." Kiran''s eyes were hard. "Your documents provide
  that catalyst. Our technology provides the proof. Together, we can burn the whole
  corrupt system down."


  The logic was monstrous and sound. Jin saw exactly what they were proposing: a joint
  announcement that would expose the Council''s crimes while revealing that the Collective
  had possessed the cure for climate collapse all along. It would devastate Earth''s
  governments. It would save millions of lives. And it would make Jin a symbol of
  the Collective''s moral authority—forever linked to an organization that had hidden
  the very technology they claimed to be liberating.


  "The broadcast would frame my leak as part of your operation," Jin said slowly.
  "I''d become your instrument. Your proof that you were right all along."


  "You''d become a symbol of truth. A beacon for anyone still trapped on Earth." Kiran
  didn''t deny the manipulation. "The cost is your independence. But the gain is global
  revolution."


  Jin stood at the viewport, watching Earth turn below—beautiful, dying, betrayed.
  He had come here to continue his fight. He hadn''t understood that fighting meant
  becoming something he didn''t want to be.


  "I''ll do it," he said finally. "But I want it noted that I objected. That this
  wasn''t my choice."


  Kiran nodded, already moving toward the door. "Noted. Now come—there''s a broadcast
  scheduled in forty-eight hours, and you have a lot to learn about playing the part
  they''ve written for you."


  He had found his platform. He had found his price. As the airlock sealed behind
  him, Jin wondered if he would ever recognize himself in the mirror again.'
