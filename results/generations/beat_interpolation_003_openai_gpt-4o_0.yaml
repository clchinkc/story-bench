output: 'Yuki moved cautiously through the dim corridors, her scanner in hand, its
  soft beeping the only reassurance in the oppressive silence. She paused at the entrance
  to the medical bay, the door sliding open with a reluctant hiss. Inside, overturned
  chairs and scattered medical instruments spoke of a hasty exodus. She sifted through
  the chaos, finding a holo-log blinking forlornly on a desk.


  The recording flickered to life. A harried-looking Dr. Anders stood amidst a room
  bustling with activity. "They''re stabilizing," he was saying, "but the molecular
  phase shift is unpredictable. We need more time." Static swallowed his next words,
  and the image dissolved.


  Yuki''s heart quickened. Molecular phase shift? She stored the log and moved on,
  the echo of her steps unsettling in their solitude. Approaching the crew quarters,
  she felt a prickle along her spine—a whisper of movement in her peripheral vision.
  She turned sharply, but the corridor was empty.


  Pushing open a crew cabin door, she found it seemingly untouched. A family photo
  pinned above a neatly made bed sent a pang of loneliness through her. Then, a sound—a
  soft, almost imperceptible hum. She turned, catching a glimpse of a shimmering presence
  in the mirror; it rippled like water disturbed by a breeze.


  Her breath caught. She reached out, her fingers passing through the air where the
  figure had been. The hum intensified, a chorus of whispers rising, and for a moment,
  faces flickered in the corners of her vision—familiar yet alien, pleading and warning
  in the same breath.


  Yuki stumbled back, her mind racing. The crew wasn''t gone; they were here, caught
  between worlds. As she backed into the hallway, a door down the passage slammed
  shut with a violent clang, the sound echoing like a gunshot. Heart pounding, she
  approached, keying her access code. The door resisted, the panel flashing red.


  Panic flared. She recalibrated her scanner, aligning its frequency with the whispers
  that filled her ears. The door''s lock clicked open, yielding to her ingenuity.
  Inside, the lab was a maze of equipment, and at its center, the data core waited—her
  ultimate destination. But she had to understand what these people had become first.


  She pressed onward, navigating the labyrinthine hallways of Station Prometheus,
  the boundary between the known and unknown blurring with every step. The whispers
  grew louder, guiding her deeper into the mystery of their fate.'
