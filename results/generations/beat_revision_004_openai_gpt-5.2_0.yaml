output: 'Detective Rachel Torres woke to a muted trumpet line bleeding from the neighbor’s
  radio through the Queens wall. She let it ride while the kettle rattled, then poured
  black coffee into a chipped precinct mug and spread case printouts across her tiny
  kitchen table.


  Sherlock, a gray cat with one nicked ear, leapt up as if he’d been assigned the
  file. He nosed the corner of an evidence photo and sat squarely on a line she’d
  highlighted in red. Rachel slid the paper out from under him, eyes narrowing. The
  detail was wrong—too clean, too staged—and her pen circled it before the thought
  finished forming.


  A ring box lay pushed to the back of the junk drawer where she kept spare batteries
  and old keys. She opened it, looked, closed it again without a sound, and nudged
  the drawer shut with her hip. Above the sink, an old photograph of her father in
  dress blues watched her gather her badge and holster with the same practiced sequence
  she’d used for years.


  She paused at the door to scratch Sherlock under the chin. For a flicker she saw
  him smaller, trembling in the shadow of police tape, eyes reflecting cruiser lights
  while uniformed hands searched an abandoned walk-up. A rookie had asked, half-joking,
  “You taking him in, Detective?” Rachel had answered by tucking him inside her coat.


  At the Riverside Precinct, the lobby buzzed with the usual mix—an irate co-op board
  member, a delivery driver clutching a dented phone, a young mother whispering to
  her kid. A corkboard near the desk carried last week’s numbers: steady overall,
  but theft reports stacked in a thickening column.


  Detective James Oyelaran caught her at the bullpen with two coffees and a raised
  brow. “You were in late again,” he said, sliding one toward her without asking how
  she took it.


  “You were in early,” Rachel returned, already reaching for the folder he’d set beside
  her hand.


  He tapped the cover once. “I pulled what you asked for. Don’t make me regret it.”


  Rachel met his eyes—no challenge, just the familiar agreement—and opened the file.


  It was a Tuesday morning in October when everything changed.'
