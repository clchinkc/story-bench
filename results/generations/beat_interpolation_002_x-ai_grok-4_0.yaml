output: 'Sarah paced her dimly lit apartment, the photograph of Amy clutched in her
  fist like evidence from a crime scene. The clock on the wall ticked mercilessly—seventy-two
  hours. Her mind, trained to dissect cases methodically, broke it down into options.
  Option one: recant. It was the path of least resistance, the one the voice on the
  phone wanted. She could march into court Monday, claim she''d been mistaken about
  seeing Vincent Marchetti execute that informant. Amy would be free, probably dumped
  somewhere alive. But the thought curdled in her gut. Marchetti was a monster; his
  family had poisoned the city for years. Recanting meant betraying her oath, letting
  a killer walk, and what then? The Marchet tis would own her forever. No, that was
  surrender, not salvation. Easy, but wrong.


  Option two: play by the book. Go official. Report the kidnapping, loop in the captain,
  maybe even the feds. They could trace the number, raid known warehouses, put Amy
  under protection while she testified. Duty demanded it—she was a cop, sworn to the
  system. But doubt gnawed at her. The Marchet tis had eyes everywhere; leaks in the
  department had sunk cases before. And time? Seventy-two hours wasn''t enough for
  bureaucracy to grind into action. One wrong move, one mole tipping them off, and
  Amy would pay the price. Her sister''s life versus the thin blue line—how could
  she choose?


  She needed air, perspective. Grabbing her keys, Sarah drove to the precinct parking
  lot under the cover of late-night shadows and texted Marcus Webb, her partner of
  five years. He met her by the chain-link fence, his face etched with concern under
  the sodium lights. "Sarah? What''s going on? You look like hell."


  She showed him the photo, recounted the call in clipped tones. Marcus swore under
  his breath. "We take this to Morrison. Now. Get a task force, surveillance on Marchetti''s
  spots. I''ll back you up—we''ll get Amy out."


  His certainty hit her like a lifeline, but as he spoke, memories flooded in: the
  botched raid last year, intel leaked straight to the family. Marcus meant well,
  but he was blind to the rot. "You really think we can trust everyone? With moles
  in the department? They''d know the second we mobilize. Amy dies, and Marchetti
  walks anyway."


  Marcus hesitated, his eyes dropping. "We have protocols for that. Internal affairs—"


  "That''s the problem," she cut in, voice low and fierce. "Protocols take time we
  don''t have. And if I testify while they''re holding her..." The pieces clicked
  in her analytical mind: neither compliance nor the system would save both Amy and
  justice. There was a third way—break the rules, go solo, use her skills without
  the oversight that would doom them. Leverage her contacts, the files she''d memorized.
  It was risky, borderline suicidal, but it was action. Her duty to the badge paled
  against her duty to family, and damn it, she could thread the needle.


  By dawn, resolve hardened in her chest. She drafted the resignation letter, knowing
  it was the only way to move freely. The Marchet tis wouldn''t see her coming.'
