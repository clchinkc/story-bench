output: 'The cold case board in Rachel Torres’s cubicle had grown into a mosaic of
  faded photographs and stubborn questions. On a Tuesday morning in October, Detective
  James Oyelaran leaned against the partition, watching her add another note to the
  sprawling collage. “Torres, the captain wants the Jenkins file closed, not turned
  into a museum exhibit.”


  “It doesn’t add up, James,” Rachel said, not turning from the board, her voice calm
  with the certainty of twelve years on the job. She took a sip of bitter, precinct-coffee.


  “Your instincts are usually right,” he conceded, a familiar rhythm to their three-year
  partnership. “But my coffee is getting cold. Briefing in five.”


  Later, in her Queens apartment, the silence was broken by a demanding meow. Sherlock
  wove between her legs as she unlocked the door, a sleek shadow she’d quietly taken
  in after a grim burglary call. The cat followed her to the kitchen, a silent witness
  as she poured kibble, his presence the only concession to a life outside the job.
  She put on a jazz record, the saxophone a lonely counterpoint to the case files
  spread across her table. This was the ordinary world: the stubborn puzzles, the
  respectful banter with James, the quiet apartment with its feline guardian. Tomorrow,
  everything would change.'
