output: "Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected\
  \ her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with\
  \ the car.\n\n\"How was Thailand?\" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.\n\
  \n\"Amazing. The temples were beautiful—and the retreat taught me to truly listen,\"\
  \ Sophie replied, her voice laced with a calm conviction that hadn’t been there\
  \ before. \"I learned more about myself in those quiet moments than I ever thought\
  \ possible.\" She hesitated before glancing briefly at her phone, now resting in\
  \ her lap, still showing the work emails and the urgent message from Linda about\
  \ three emergencies and the looming Pearson account.\n\n\"I know work always calls,\"\
  \ she continued, her eyes reflecting a newfound steadiness. \"But I've finally realized\
  \ that I have to choose when to answer it.\" Instead of immediately typing a response,\
  \ Sophie took a deep breath, setting the phone aside with deliberate care. \"Linda\
  \ will understand a little delay, and the Pearson account won't manage itself if\
  \ I let a moment of presence pass by.\" \n\nThey drove in silence for a while. The\
  \ familiar Chicago skyline appeared through the evening haze—the comforting outlines\
  \ of her apartment building, the coffee shop where her morning latte was a ritual.\
  \ Yet as she looked at these unchanged landmarks, Sophie saw them with fresh eyes:\
  \ opportunities for balance rather than mere reminders of routine.\n\n\"It's good\
  \ to be home,\" she said, genuine warmth in her tone, as if the simple phrase encapsulated\
  \ her transformed attitude. The world of relentless work demands would always be\
  \ there, but now she carried with her a quiet confidence and a commitment to reclaiming\
  \ her life, one mindful moment at a time."
