output: 'The champagne flute in Miri''s hand cost more than her first apartment. She
  set it down on a passing waiter''s tray—Leo''s tray, actually, his earpiece barely
  visible beneath the slicked-back hair—and murmured, "Cameras?"


  "Looping in three, two, one. You''re a ghost."


  She slipped through the Tsarina''s lower deck corridor like she belonged there,
  which was the trick, really. Belong hard enough and doors opened themselves. The
  service entrance to Sorokin''s private gallery required a keycard she''d lifted
  from his head of household staff three days ago, a six-digit code Ava had charmed
  from a drunk security guard last night, and a retinal scan.


  "Ava, tell me you got the print."


  "Got it off his Montblanc pen at dinner. Transferring now." The contact lens in
  Miri''s left eye flickered, displaying Sorokin''s retinal pattern. She pressed her
  face to the scanner.


  Green light. She was in.


  The gallery was climate-controlled, museum-quality. Sorokin had taste, she''d give
  him that. Terrible morals, but taste. The Hoffmann painting hung center wall—a small
  Madonna, luminous even in security lighting. Eighty years since the Kleins had seen
  it. Three generations of legal battles, dismissed.


  "Pressure sensors on the frame," Leo warned. "Give me sixty seconds."


  Miri waited, studying the Madonna''s face. Patient. She could be patient.


  "Done. But Miri? There''s a secondary system I''ve never seen before. Military-grade
  encryption on the vault backup."


  Minor hiccup. They''d handled worse.


  The frame came away clean. She was sliding the painting into its protective tube
  when Leo''s voice crackled: "We have a problem. Security chief just entered the
  gallery deck."


  "So? Ava''s running interference upstairs—"


  "Miri." His voice had changed. "It''s Brandt. Helena Brandt."


  The name hit like ice water. Miri''s hands didn''t shake—she''d trained them not
  to—but something cold settled in her chest.


  Helena Brandt. Her mentor. The woman who''d taught her everything about conservation,
  about the sacred trust between art and its guardians. The woman who''d planted stolen
  sketches in Miri''s workstation and watched her get arrested.


  "She''s consulting for Sorokin," Leo continued. "Has been for six months. That military
  encryption? It''s hers. She designed this system."


  The painting was in her hands. The exit was forty feet away. She had maybe three
  minutes before Helena''s sweep reached this corridor.


  But Helena knew her methods. Every trick, every tell. This wasn''t a heist anymore—it
  was a chess match against the person who''d taught her to play.


  "New plan," Miri breathed. "Leo, I need you to trigger the engine room fire suppression.
  Ava, get to the tender bay."


  "That wasn''t the extraction route—"


  "It is now."


  Above deck, the Grand Prix roared past the harbor, masking the sound of alarms beginning
  to wail.


  "She''s tracking the painting." Leo''s voice was strained now. "Micro-GPS in the
  frame—she knew someone would come for it. Miri, she''s been waiting for you specifically."


  The tender bay was two decks down. Helena was one deck up and closing. Ava''s position
  showed on Miri''s phone—she''d made it to the service stairs, but security had locked
  down the port side.


  "I can''t get through," Ava said. "They''ve got two guards on the stairwell."


  "Use the distraction." Miri was moving now, abandoning caution for speed. "Engine
  room fire suppression hits in thirty seconds. When it does—"


  "When it does, Helena will know exactly where you''re headed." Leo cut in. "You
  taught me that engine room exit, Miri. Which means she taught you. She''ll be there."


  He was right. The escape route she''d scouted—the one that used the fire suppression
  chaos as cover—was Helena''s playbook. Of course it was.


  "Then I''ll meet her there."


  "Miri, no. We grab the painting, we go. Revenge isn''t the mission."


  But Leo didn''t understand. Helena wasn''t just a betrayal. She was the reason Miri
  had spent eighteen months proving her innocence while her reputation rotted. The
  reason she''d had to become a thief to serve justice.


  The suppression system triggered. Steam flooded the lower deck. Through the haze,
  Miri saw two figures: Ava, pinned behind a bulkhead with a guard advancing—and Helena,
  stepping calmly through the emergency exit, her smile exactly as Miri remembered.


  "Hello, darling. I wondered when you''d come for the Madonna."


  The painting or Ava. The mission or her crew.


  Helena knew which one Miri would choose. Had always known. That was the trap.


  Miri''s hand tightened on the tube.'
