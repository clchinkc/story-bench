output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled, lowering its head. "Your brother
  thought the same thing."


  The words hit harder than flame. Kira''s grip faltered. How did the dragon know
  about him?


  "He died screaming your name," the dragon continued, circling. "Do you think you''re
  stronger than he was?"


  The battle became a nightmare. Each time Kira attacked, the dragon''s words cut
  deeper than its claws. *Your fault, Your fault, Your fault*—a rhythm beneath the
  roaring. When she was knocked down the first time, tears blurred her vision. When
  she was knocked down the second time, she didn''t rise immediately; she lay there,
  gasping, suffocated by the weight of guilt. The dragon''s shadow consumed her.


  On the third time, something broke inside her—not her body, but the lie she''d been
  living. She wasn''t fighting to avenge her brother. She was fighting to prove she
  wasn''t as weak, as stupid, as *useless* as she''d convinced herself he''d been.
  Her brother hadn''t failed because he was weak. He''d died because that''s what
  happened to heroes in this world.


  In that dark moment, kneeling in ash and blood, Kira understood: she could die here,
  and that would be enough. The choice to fight despite certain death—that was the
  victory, not the winning. The guilt would never leave her. Her brother would never
  come back. But she could still stand.


  She rose, not with renewed strength but with acceptance. When the dragon struck
  again, overconfident in her despair, Kira drove her sword through the gap in its
  scales with absolute clarity. Not because she was stronger. Because she was finally
  free.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  victorious but fundamentally altered. She had died in that chasm—the version of
  herself that believed salvation required erasure of the past.


  She began the walk back to camp, carrying both her victory and her grief, transformed.'
