output: "Priya grabbed a spatula, her excitement infectious. “Let’s do this! We’re\
  \ not giving up yet!” Dev sighed but couldn’t help the hint of a smile tugging at\
  \ his lips. They rehashed their strategy: attract customers with free samples of\
  \ their Paneer BBQ Tacos, flashing their handwritten menu, and showcasing their\
  \ unique fusion. \n\nIn the meantime, Priya had an idea. “Let’s make a TikTok! We\
  \ can show the process, the flavors!” Dev raised an eyebrow, but before he could\
  \ object, she was already filming snippets of sizzling paneer, bright spices twinkling\
  \ like confetti, and the eclectic décor inside the bus. \n\nThe video went live,\
  \ and a few minutes later, something magical happened. The phone buzzed with notifications,\
  \ and Priya’s heart raced. “Look! People are sharing it!” She watched in disbelief\
  \ as the views skyrocketed. Their quirky food truck, once a meme for the wrong reasons,\
  \ transformed into a viral sensation overnight. \n\nWithin an hour, a line formed.\
  \ Dev, still stunned, jumped into action. “I’ll chop, you cook!” They worked in\
  \ tandem, their laughter mixing with the sizzling sounds of their food. Priya felt\
  \ the thrill of the rush, the joy of serving customers who appreciated their passion.\
  \ \n\nThen, just as they began to feel invincible, a rival food truck pulled up\
  \ nearby, emblazoned with bold lettering: “Tex-Mex Takedown.” Priya recognized the\
  \ owner, a brash competitor named Carlos, who had a reputation for undercutting\
  \ prices and stealing customers. He waved, flashing a grin as he began dishing out\
  \ tacos with a flair. \n\n“Great. Just what we need,” Dev muttered, glancing nervously\
  \ at the crowd. Priya bit her lip, but instead of feeling defeated, she felt a fire\
  \ ignite within her. “Let’s show them what we’ve got!” \n\nFor the next few hours,\
  \ the bus bustled with activity, their unique fusion tacos becoming the talk of\
  \ the event. Dev and Priya exchanged grins as they served customer after customer,\
  \ each bite met with delighted expressions. They even had a moment when a customer\
  \ exclaimed, “This is the best taco I’ve ever had!” That was the moment Priya knew\
  \ they were onto something special. \n\nAround sunset, as they took a breather,\
  \ Priya turned to Dev, her eyes sparkling. “Can you believe this? We’re actually\
  \ doing it!” They shared a genuine connection in that moment, relishing their hard\
  \ work. \n\nBut soon after, a notification pinged on Priya’s phone, and her heart\
  \ sank. “Oh no…” she murmured. Dev peered over, his brow furrowing. “What is it?”\
  \ \n\n“It’s a negative review. They’re saying we’re overpriced compared to Carlos’s\
  \ truck.” \n\nThe excitement evaporated, replaced by a chill of tension. They had\
  \ succeeded in drawing in customers, yet the stakes were higher than ever. The threat\
  \ of their rival loomed larger, and Priya realized they were just getting started."
