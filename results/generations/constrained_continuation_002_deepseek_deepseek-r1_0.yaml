output: 'Priya''s phone kept buzzing like an angry hornet. By sunset, ironic hashtags
  had spawned a pilgrimage of curious Austinites. A college student''s TikTok video—"Trying
  the Disaster Truck''s Paneer Tacos (Pray for Me)"—went viral when her exaggerated
  grimace melted into wide-eyed delight after the first bite. Orders exploded overnight.


  Monday morning, a line snaked around the block. Dev frantically manned the grill
  while Priya juggled orders, their rhythm evolving from panicked collisions to seamless
  coordination. "Behind you!" Priya called, sliding fresh naan across the counter
  as Dev flipped sizzling paneer. Sweat plastered his hair to his forehead, but he
  flashed a rare grin when a group of construction workers demanded thirds.


  Their rhythm shattered when "Smokehouse King" rolled into the adjacent lot—a gleaming
  black truck dripping with trophies. Its owner, Chad, leaned out smirking. "Cute
  gimmick, fusion kids. Real BBQ doesn''t need cheese." He blasted country music,
  luring half their queue away.


  Priya thrust a tray of tacos into Dev''s hands. "Counterattack?" He nodded, shouting
  over the din: "Free samples! Punjabi-BBQ fusion—prove Chad wrong!" They moved in
  unison, feeding curious defectors spicy-sweet morsels. As customers drifted back,
  Chad''s scowl deepened. During the lull, Priya bumped fists with Dev. "We make one
  hell of a team, Patel." He chuckled. "Still think paneer tacos are insane. But your
  grandma''s tamarind glaze? Genius."


  By week''s end, they''d sold out daily. Counting stacks of cash in their tiny kitchen,
  Priya danced. "Championship here we—" Her phone pinged. The competition''s updated
  rules: finalists needed verified sales receipts from three locations. Dev paled.
  "We only have permits for this lot. City approvals take months..." Priya''s smile
  froze as Chad''s truck rumbled past, his new banner flapping: "OFFICIAL CHAMPIONSHIP
  QUALIFIER—FOUR LOCATIONS." The scent of victory turned abruptly sour.'
