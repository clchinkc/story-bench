output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out. The echo of basketballs from the
  gym down the hall sounded suddenly distant, like it belonged to someone else.


  “There has to be something we can do,” said Denise, his assistant director.


  “I don’t know.” Marcus slumped into his chair. “We could try to find another location,
  but the rent anywhere else would be triple what we pay here.”


  “What about the fundraiser? We still have three weeks. If we could raise enough—”
  Denise’s voice snagged. She didn’t meet his eyes. “Marcus… the Daniels Foundation
  called this morning. They’re pulling their pledge. They said the developer’s firm
  is matching donations—for their new ‘youth initiative.’ Everyone’s switching sides.”


  His stomach tightened. He rubbed his temples. “And there’s that grant application
  we submitted. We should hear back next week. If that comes through…”


  Denise’s laptop chimed. She glanced at the screen, went pale, and turned it toward
  him. RE: Community Outreach Grant—Decision. The first line was short and final:
  Regret to inform you…


  Before he could breathe, his phone buzzed. A text from his wife: “I’m taking the
  kids to my sister’s. They asked why you missed the recital again. I can’t keep explaining.
  Call me when you’re done fighting this building.”


  The room tilted. The flyer mockups on his desk—smiling faces, bright promises—looked
  obscene.


  Denise swallowed. “I’m so sorry. And… I need to tell you something else. The board
  met without you. They voted to suspend operations immediately. Liability. They’re
  changing the locks Friday.”


  Marcus stared at her, waiting for the second half of the sentence—the part where
  she said she’d stopped it.


  Denise set her keys on his desk, the metal clink loud in the quiet. “I can’t go
  down with it. I accepted an offer at Eastside.”


  Her footsteps faded down the corridor. The gym noise stopped, as if someone had
  shut a door inside his chest. Marcus sat alone with the notice, with Thirty days
  to vacate the community center, with a program that was already over.'
