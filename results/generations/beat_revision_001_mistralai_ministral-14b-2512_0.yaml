  Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands, the weight not just from exhaustion but from the ghost of her brother’s voice
  still echoing in her mind. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales
  and burning eyes, exactly as the prophecies had described. Its breath was smoke
  that tasted of ash and regret.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. The words coiled around her like
  the shadows between her ribs. "Not when your hands still shake with guilt. Not when
  you hear his voice every time you try to swing."


  Kira’s breath hitched. She tightened her grip until her knuckles screamed, but she
  knew the truth—each tremble was a betrayal, each swing a failure. The memory of
  her brother’s body in the ruins, of the way his blood had mixed with hers as she
  dragged him from the wreckage, should have been enough. But now, the dragon’s words
  tore it fresh again.


  She thought of the village that had burned behind her, of the oath she’d broken
  the second she stepped away from his side. Of the way the elders had looked at her
  afterward, as if she’d hollowed out like the dragon’s scales. Of the whispers that
  followed her: *Coward.* *Killer.* *Unworthy.*


  The blade in her hand felt foreign, a weapon unfit for this burden. But she raised
  it anyway.


  The battle was brutal. Flame scorched her armor, but the pain was nothing compared
  to the searing weight of memory: her brother’s last gasp, the way the dragon’s fire
  had consumed their home. Claws raked across her shield, but she didn’t feel them—only
  the way his hands had slipped from her own.


  Three times she was knocked down, not by the dragon’s strength alone but by the
  waves of grief that crashed over her. Three times she rose again, not because the
  earth held her, but because the dragon’s voice hissed in her ear: *You’ll never
  be clean enough to wield that sword. His death stains your soul.*


  Her arms burned with exhaustion. Blood ran from a gash on her forehead, but it was
  the blood in her dreams—the nightmares she couldn’t outrun—that made her flinch.


  Then, the dragon overextended. For a heartbeat, there was only silence. No whispers.
  No ghosts.


  And Kira’s brother’s face, not twisted in agony, but proud.


  With the last of her strength, she drove her sword through the gap in its scales,
  piercing its heart. The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar, its body
  crumbling into smoke that swirled like the wind through the ruins of her old life.


  Kira stood over its body, her knees no longer trembling. The dragon’s words had
  been a lie—not her guilt, but her belief in it. She’d carried its poison, thinking
  the wound was hers. But this was *fear*, not failure. And fear could be cut down.


  She whispered, *"I did it."* But the words weren’t for the others in camp.


  They were for herself.'
