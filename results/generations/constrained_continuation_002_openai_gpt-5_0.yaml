output: 'Priya grabbed a chalk marker and wrote on their sandwich board in giant loopy
  letters: DISASTER SPECIAL: 2-for-1 paneer tacos if you say it to our faces. Dev
  winced, then angled his phone. “Lean into the skid,” she said, and slapped a block
  of paneer onto the griddle. It squeaked, hissed, flared. Dev overlaid the blogger’s
  caption on the video, added their sizzle, Priya’s deadpan: “We own it.” He posted.


  By the time the paneer blistered, three teens were there, breathless, holding up
  their phones. “We came for the disaster!” one yelled, laughing. Priya tucked smoky
  cubes into soft naan, drag of jalapeño raita, a lace of tamarind barbecue. The girls
  filmed the first bite. “Bro, that crunch,” one whispered. Comments popped. A guy
  on a scooter did a U-turn. A group in yoga pants queued up.


  Then a matte-black Airstream rolled in with a neon longhorn on its flank: TikkaTex.
  Its owner, a tall woman in red lipstick and mirrored aviators, swung down like a
  rodeo queen. “You kids picked the wrong lot,” she said cheerfully. “Name’s Roxy.
  Folks in East Austin know me.”


  Dev’s eyebrows climbed. Priya smiled without showing teeth. “Hi, Roxy. I’m Priya.
  We’re the disaster.”


  “You said it, not me,” Roxy said, and winked at the growing line.


  The next hour blurred. Dev morphed into a traffic controller, taping blue painter’s
  lines six feet apart and calling numbers like a DJ. Priya moved like she was choreographing
  a dance: press, flip, sauce, sprinkle. Dev learned to fold the naan so it hugged
  its fillings without tearing; Priya taught him to read the paneer by sound. “Squeak
  means raw. Hiss means perfect. Pop means you’re about to set my hair on fire,” she
  barked, and he laughed while dodging the torch.


  When the griddle couldn’t keep up, he improvised a warming tray with foil and a
  steam pan. When the card reader froze, she sent him sprinting to the coffee shop
  for Wi‑Fi while she took Venmo with a permanent marker scribble. They moved as one
  organism, sweaty and grinning, short-handing each other: “Two masala brisket, extra
  achaar, one no-cilantro, tell table five sorry about the paneer delay.”


  A construction crew rolled up with orange vests and hollered “DISASTER!” in unison.
  Someone brought a portable speaker and put on bhangra remixes. The blogger who had
  roasted them went live from the curb, eyebrows arched. She ordered the “disaster,”
  took a slow, theatrical bite—and blinked. “Okay,” she said to her phone. “Against
  all odds, it slaps.”


  Her live blew up. Cars nosed in. Roxy’s line swelled too; she sliced flawless brisket
  in a brisk, practiced motion and shot them a salute, competitive and cordial. “See
  you at the Championship qualifier,” she called.


  Dev handed Priya a water. Her hands shook. “I knew we could do it,” she said, then
  corrected herself. “No, I knew we could do it.”


  “We,” he echoed. “You dream. I spreadsheet.” He bumped her elbow with his. It steadied
  her more than the water.


  At sunset, the cooler was a graveyard of empty yogurt tubs. Priya stared down the
  last jar—her grandmother’s masala blend, its taped label smudged. Only a dusting
  left. She’d been rationing without admitting it. She twisted it shut and slid it
  back like a secret.


  They closed with hand cramps and soot-streaked faces. The blogger posted again,
  a stitched clip of their morning chaos to their evening line, captioned: “From disaster
  to dark horse?” Within minutes, the Austin Food Truck Championship account DM’d:
  Wildcard slot open. Can y’all make tomorrow’s qualifier?


  Priya read it twice. Dev whooped. She whooped back, a sound that scraped her throat.
  They were in.


  Then the next message arrived, official and unsmiling: To compete, provide proof
  of commissary kitchen, propane variance, and capacity to serve 500 plates in one
  hour. Surprise inspection at 8 a.m. TikkaTex replied to the thread with a thumbs-up,
  a photo of their gleaming second rig, and a caption: “Double fire, baby.”


  Priya and Dev stared at their single battered griddle, the scorched spot above the
  awning from an overzealous torch, the messy binder with permits they’d rushed through
  at midnight, the almost-empty masala jar. Outside, a stranger took a selfie in front
  of the pink bus. Inside, victory tasted like smoke and cardamom—and the stakes rose
  like heat.'
