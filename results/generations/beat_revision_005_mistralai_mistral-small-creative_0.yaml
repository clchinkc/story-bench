output: 'The apartment was dark when Maya finally unlocked the door. She didn’t turn
  on the lights—what was the point? The gallery had closed its doors that morning,
  twenty years of her mother’s legacy reduced to a "LEASE AVAILABLE" sign in the window.
  The finality of it settled in her chest like a stone.


  She slid down against the wall, still in her coat, the cold seeping through her
  clothes. The city hummed outside, indifferent. Her phone lay silent in her pocket—no
  more calls to make, no more pleas to send. The crowdfunding had failed. The investors
  had walked away. Even her brother had stopped answering. She was alone with the
  weight of it all.


  Her mother’s last painting hung in the shadows across the room—a woman walking toward
  an unseen horizon. Maya remembered the hospice, the way her mother’s hand had trembled
  in hers, the way she’d whispered, *"It’s not about the art. It’s about giving people
  a place to feel something real."* And now that place was gone. Maya had promised
  to keep it alive. She had failed.


  The silence pressed in around her, thick and suffocating. She thought of her mother’s
  voice, the way it had grown weaker with each passing day, the way she’d looked at
  Maya with such trust. *"You’ll carry it forward."* But she hadn’t. She had let it
  slip through her fingers.


  Outside, the city moved on—cars, sirens, life—but in here, time had stopped. There
  was nothing left to do. No more fights to fight. No more battles to win. Just the
  hollow ache of everything she’d lost.


  Tomorrow, she would have to decide what came next. But tonight, she let the darkness
  take her.'
