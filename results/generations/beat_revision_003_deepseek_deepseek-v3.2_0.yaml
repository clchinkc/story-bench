output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... clarifying." Sophie felt the weight of her phone in her purse, the phantom
  urge to check it. She left it there. "I learned to sit with the quiet."


  Her mother glanced over. "No work emails? That''s a first."


  "They can wait," Sophie said, the words feeling foreign but true. The retreat had
  taught her that urgency was often a choice. She saw the notification light blinking
  later, a silent scream about the Pearson account and three emergencies from Linda.
  The old Sophie would already be typing. This Sophie watched the city lights approach
  and took a slow, deliberate breath.


  They drove in silence for a while. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through
  the evening haze. Sophie''s apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought
  her morning latte. Everything was exactly as she''d left it, yet none of it looked
  the same. It was a place, not a prison.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, and for the first time, she meant the peace she
  carried within her, not the routine that awaited. She would call Linda in the morning.
  The account would survive the night.'
