output: "The British checkpoint at the edge of Cape Coast was a cage of red-brick\
  \ heat and watchful eyes. Amara clutched her bundle of yams tighter, the forged\
  \ pass sewn into its cloth wrapping prickling her palm. She’d memorized the guards’\
  \ shifts, knew the scent of their uniforms—stale wool and pipe smoke—but nothing\
  \ prepared her for the suddenness of the threshold itself. A corporal she’d scrubbed\
  \ floors for last year stepped forward, his mustache twitching. “Girl,” he said,\
  \ in the clipped tone of a man who’d once ordered her to polish his boots. Amara\
  \ dropped her gaze, let her shoulders hunch like the market women she’d studied.\
  \ “Massa,” she murmured in Twi, “the river road’s safest before sunset.” When he\
  \ demanded her papers in English, she feigned confusion. “My English no good, sah.”\
  \ The lie was a blade’s edge—her father’s lessons had taught her the queen’s tongue\
  \ as well as any Oxford man—but she let her hands tremble, her eyes dart to the\
  \ forest beyond. He thrust the pass back with a sneer. “Filthy Kroomen don’t need\
  \ to read.” She walked until the sound of his boots faded, her spine rigid, the\
  \ ache in her chest a raw bloom. The city’s salt-stained air was gone. She was no\
  \ longer the scholar’s daughter hiding behind servant’s garb. She was a message\
  \ on two legs, and the forest would rather swallow her whole.  \n\nThe Ashanti bush\
  \ chewed days like a hungry python. Amara learned to sip water through a reed in\
  \ the mud, to sleep with her ears tuned for leopard coughs. But it was the man at\
  \ the cocoa farm who unsettled her most—a trader named Kwame with eyes that flicked\
  \ between his own tongue and hers. He’d fed her roasted plantains, his questions\
  \ casual: *Why travel alone? What village awaits?* She’d lied, but his silence after\
  \ each falsehood had been a mirror. When British soldiers thundered past his compound\
  \ at dawn, Amara bolted awake, reaching for the knife she didn’t carry. Kwame shoved\
  \ her into a yam cellar, his whisper hot: “Tell me now, girl. Are you fool or fighter?”\
  \ The words came before her fear—“I carry word of hangings”—and his face shifted,\
  \ the cellar air thickening with the weight of her truth. He gave her a headscarf\
  \ dyed indigo, the color of resistance women. “They’ll stop you for being alone,”\
  \ he said, “but not for being mine.” She wore the cloth to evade patrols, but also\
  \ to remember: her letters had made her powerful, but only in the shadows. Now,\
  \ in the light, she’d need more. Kwame taught her the Ewe phrase for *safe passage*,\
  \ a password to hidden camps. She learned it by dusk, when he pressed a calabash\
  \ of palm wine into her hands and said, “The resistance isn’t only brave men. It’s\
  \ women who burn records, boys who steal horses. But the British know this. They’ve\
  \ placed their own among us.” The wine soured in her throat. Ink and paper wouldn’t\
  \ save her now.  \n\nTwo days from the stronghold, Amara scrubbed the indigo from\
  \ her hair, her fingers raw. Kwame’s map had been simple—a crocodile-shaped river,\
  \ a baobab with a split trunk—but the terrain lied. The forest closed in, thorns\
  \ tearing her calico. Her canteen was dust. The British were closer now; she’d heard\
  \ their rifles cracking at dawn. The crocodile river was a serpent of mud, and the\
  \ dugout canoe rotting at its bank had a bullet hole in its bow. She could swim,\
  \ but the current would snap her bones. The soldiers would find her this time. She\
  \ let the terror flood in, then bled it away. Her father’s voice: *The pen is a\
  \ weapon, but so is the mind that wields it.* She stripped off her tunic, bound\
  \ her breasts with cloth, and smeared ash on her cheeks. When the patrol’s voices\
  \ rose—*“There’s the wench!”*—she plunged into the shallows, howling like a madwoman.\
  \ They hesitated, superstitious, and she seized the moment, sprinting for the rotting\
  \ tree. The sentry in its branches nearly shot her before she rasped, in German,\
  \ *“Ich bin die Tochter von Mensah.”* The password her father had chosen, trusting\
  \ only the language the British dismissed as too obscure for spies. Rope ladders\
  \ descended. As they pulled her into the stronghold’s canopy, she stared at the\
  \ distant smoke of Cape Coast. Survival had been a game of invisibility. Resistance\
  \ would demand she become a wildfire."
