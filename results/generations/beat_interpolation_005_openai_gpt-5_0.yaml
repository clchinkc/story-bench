output: 'She woke to the sound of a pan hitting tile and the sharp, accusing scent
  of scorched garlic. The kitchen was dim, lit only by the fridge glow and a pool
  of under-cabinet light. Alejandro stood at the stove in track pants and a T-shirt,
  an apron slung over one shoulder like a half-fought truce. A blackened pan smoked
  on a cold burner.


  “I wasn’t hungry,” he said before she could speak, his mouth set. “I was…angry.”


  “At the garlic?” she asked, because humor sometimes made men put down their swords.


  “At myself.” He lifted the pan, then set it down. His hands were steady, but his
  gaze wasn’t. “They all tried to impress me. Courses, foams, towers. I sent them
  away because I couldn’t tell them the truth. Since the surgery, food tastes like…rainwater.
  The tabloids said I’d gone spoiled. The truth is worse.”


  The admission hung between them, fragile as glass. Maya stepped in, turned off the
  burner completely, and reached for the pantry. “My grandmother made sopa de ajo
  when my world felt thin,” she said. “It’s not fancy. It’s stubborn.”


  She sliced stale bread, warmed olive oil until it shimmered, coaxed sweetness from
  new garlic instead of fury from burnt, dusted pimentón that bloomed brick-red in
  the pan. He watched her, the tension in his shoulders easing with each small, practical
  act. When she poured stock, steam rose carrying smoke and warmth; she cracked eggs
  into the simmering broth, the whites veiling, the yolks golden as late sun.


  “Here,” she said, handing him the wooden spoon. “Stir. Gentle. The egg will break
  if you bully it.”


  He huffed something like a laugh and obeyed. Their fingers brushed in the exchange;
  he didn’t retreat. When she ladled it into two bowls, she splashed the barest thread
  of sherry vinegar across his.


  “For brightness,” she said. “You said rainwater. This is a window.”


  He took a cautious sip. Then another, larger. He closed his eyes. For a heartbeat
  he was not the legend or the recluse, just a man surprised to find a door where
  he’d expected a wall. “Smoke,” he said, incredulous. “And…something sharp. It’s…there.”


  Maya felt heat rise behind her eyes, unexpected and dangerous. “Then we’ll keep
  going. Not with tasting menus. With this. Real food, small plates, every day until
  your appetite remembers you.”


  “Lucia will hate it,” he said, but his voice was softer. “The schedule.”


  “Lucia can send me a memo,” Maya said. “I’m not here to perform. I’m here to feed
  you.”


  She wasn’t thinking of invoices when she said it. She was thinking of how careful
  he’d been with the eggs, of the way hope had startled his face. Six months suddenly
  felt like a beginning instead of a sentence.


  They carried their bowls to the open doors where night pressed cool against the
  house and the sea muttered below. He didn’t step onto the balcony; neither did she.
  They stood in the threshold and ate, shoulder to shoulder but not touching, listening
  to waves and spoon-scrapes and the small, unfashionable sound of someone relearning
  pleasure.


  “Tomorrow?” he asked, not looking at her.


  “Tomorrow,” she said, and meant more than the contract.'
