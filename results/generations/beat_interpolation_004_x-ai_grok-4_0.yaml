output: 'Thomas swallowed hard, the note crumpling in his fist as he rose. The courtroom
  air felt thick, charged with the weight of unspoken threats. Dr. Okonkwo''s hands
  trembled as she adjusted the microphone, her gaze flickering toward the defense
  table where the CEO''s smirk lingered like a promise.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," Thomas began, his voice steady despite the storm inside him, "can
  you describe your role at Meridian Pharmaceuticals?"


  She hesitated, lips parting then closing. "I... I was head of research. Oversaw
  clinical trials."


  He pressed on, methodically laying the foundation. "And during the trial for Zorvax,
  the experimental painkiller, did you uncover evidence of falsified data?"


  Her eyes darted to her lap, where her fingers twisted a wedding ring. The gallery
  held its breath. Thomas could see the fear etching deeper lines on her face—the
  same fear that had gripped him when he read the note. Meridian''s offer wasn''t
  just a bribe; it was a lifeline for her dying daughter, dangled and now yanked away
  unless she betrayed the truth.


  "Yes," she whispered, then louder, "No. I mean... there were discrepancies, but
  they were minor. Not intentional."


  A murmur rippled through the room. Thomas''s heart plummeted. This was it—the recantation.
  The defense attorney leaned back, satisfaction blooming. Seventeen families in the
  gallery shifted, their hopes fracturing. His father''s stone gaze bored into him
  from afar, a silent demand: Justice isn''t negotiable.


  But Thomas couldn''t let it end like this. He abandoned his prepared questions,
  stepping closer to the stand, voice dropping to a fierce whisper that carried through
  the microphone. "Dr. Okonkwo, look at me. Not them. I know about the offer. I know
  what they''re holding over you—your daughter''s life. My father taught me that justice
  bends for no one, but I''ve bent rules before to save what''s right. If you lie
  now, those seventeen deaths become eighteen, because it''ll kill something in you
  too. But if you tell the truth, I''ll fight for her. Personally. I''ll call every
  contact, every favor. We can find another way."


  She stared at him, tears welling. The courtroom hung in suspended agony, seconds
  stretching like hours. Her shoulders slumped, then straightened. "The data was falsified,"
  she said, voice cracking but resolute. "I have the reports—the buried adverse reactions,
  the emails ordering the cover-up. Seventeen people died because we ignored the risks.
  I can''t ignore this anymore."


  Thomas nodded, exhaling as she produced a flash drive from her pocket, handing it
  to the bailiff. The defense objected furiously, but the judge overruled. The evidence
  poured out in her testimony, damning and detailed, each word a hammer blow to Meridian''s
  facade. The turning point crashed like a wave—the truth, raw and unyielding, sealing
  the case''s fate. Yet as the tension peaked, Thomas felt no triumph, only the hollow
  ache of a victory forged in desperation.'
