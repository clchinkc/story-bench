output: 'The champagne reception buzzed with Monaco''s elite while Miri adjusted her
  emerald cocktail dress, mentally cataloging security cameras through the yacht''s
  panoramic windows. Below deck, her crew moved like clockwork. Jules, her tech specialist
  with anxiety that disappeared behind computer screens, had already looped the camera
  feeds. Meanwhile, Chen—former circus acrobat turned art handler—slipped through
  the ventilation system toward Sorokin''s private gallery, his compact frame perfect
  for navigating the yacht''s tight spaces.


  "Painting''s location confirmed," Chen''s voice crackled through Miri''s nearly
  invisible earpiece. "But there''s a pressure-sensitive floor around the display
  case. Wasn''t in the blueprints."


  Miri smiled at a passing oligarch''s wife. "Jules, can you disable it?"


  "Already on it. Give me ninety seconds." His fingers flew across his tablet, hidden
  behind a champagne cart in the service corridor. "I''m rerouting the sensor grid
  through the yacht''s stabilization system. It''ll read the floor as constantly under
  load."


  "Brilliant." Miri sipped her champagne, watching the harbor lights twinkle. The
  *Portrait of Sarah Goldstein* had hung in an Amsterdam townhouse until 1943. Eighty
  years later, she''d finally go home.


  Chen''s voice returned: "I''m in. Beautiful piece—definitely authentic. The brushwork
  on the collar is exquisite."


  "Save the art history lecture," Miri murmured, but she was grinning. Everything
  was proceeding perfectly.


  Then Jules''s voice cut through, sharp with concern: "Miri, we''ve got a problem.
  I just accessed the guest manifest. Dr. Victoria Blackwood is aboard."


  Miri''s champagne glass suddenly felt slippery in her grip. Her former mentor, the
  woman who''d destroyed her career, was here.


  Miri forced herself to breathe steadily, scanning the crowded deck with new urgency.
  "Where exactly is she, Jules?"


  "VIP suite, starboard side. But that''s not all." His voice carried an edge she''d
  never heard before. "I''ve accessed her communications. She''s not here as a guest—she''s
  Sorokin''s new security consultant. And Miri? She knows we''re here. Has files on
  all of us."


  The deck tilted slightly as another yacht passed, and Miri gripped the railing.
  Through the crowd, she glimpsed a familiar silhouette—silver hair, predatory elegance.
  Victoria Blackwood stood near the bridge, speaking into her phone.


  "Chen, how long until you''re out?" Miri asked, her voice carefully level.


  "Two minutes, maybe three. This case has fourteen different locks."


  "You don''t have three minutes," Jules interrupted, panic creeping in. "Security''s
  mobilizing. Internal cameras just switched to manual control—she''s taken over my
  feeds. They''re heading for the gallery now."


  Miri''s mind raced. The painting was within reach, but Victoria had turned this
  into a trap. She could warn Chen to abort, but then Sarah Goldstein''s portrait
  would remain in the hands of a man whose grandfather had likely stolen it. Or she
  could spring Victoria''s trap and hope they could all escape.


  "Jules, emergency protocol seven," she decided. "Reroute the yacht''s power grid
  to the ballroom. Full blackout in sixty seconds."


  Jules hesitated. "That''s... that''s going to trap us in the dark with them."


  "Sometimes you have to break a few rules to return stolen art to its owners."


  The yacht''s engines suddenly coughed, and the lights flickered ominously as Jules''s
  fingers moved across his screen.'
