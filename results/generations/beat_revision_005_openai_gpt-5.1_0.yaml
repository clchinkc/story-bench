  This segment clearly fulfills the Dark Night of the Soul beat: it follows the All
  Is Lost moment of the gallery’s closure, isolates Maya in a dark apartment, and
  centers on her raw sense of failure regarding her mother’s legacy. The reflection
  is genuine despair rather than simple sadness, with no real solutions offered—only
  the acknowledgment that “tomorrow” she’ll have to face whatever comes next. The
  memory of her mother in hospice and the dead gallery function as an effective “whiff
  of death,” underscoring mortality and the death of a dream.'
