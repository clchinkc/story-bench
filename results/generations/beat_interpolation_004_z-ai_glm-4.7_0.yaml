output: 'Thomas gripped the edges of the podium, the wood biting into his palms. "Dr.
  Okonkwo, please identify the document entered into evidence as Exhibit 42."


  Okonkwo picked up the sheaf of papers. Her hands trembled visibly. She glanced toward
  the defense table, where the Meridian CEO watched her with predatory, half-lidded
  calm.


  "It... it appears to be the initial safety report," she said, her voice thin and
  reedy.


  "And did you authorize its release?"


  "I..." She swallowed hard, her throat clicking in the silent room. "I believe I
  may have signed it, but I cannot attest to its accuracy at this time. The data was...
  inconclusive."


  A murmur of shock rippled through the gallery. Thomas felt the floor drop out from
  under him. She was taking the out. She was trading the truth for her daughter’s
  life.


  "Dr. Okonkwo," Thomas said, his voice cutting through the noise. "Your Honor, I
  request a sidebar. Immediately."


  Judge Harold Wright’s eyes narrowed behind his spectacles, but he beckoned the lawyers
  forward with a sharp motion.


  At the bench, the air was electric. Thomas leaned in, speaking low and fast, ignoring
  the defense attorney’s confused sputter. He looked directly at Okonkwo, bypassing
  the judge entirely.


  "I know about the offer," Thomas whispered, his eyes locking onto hers. "I know
  what they’re holding over you. But listen to me. I reached out to a contact at Mass
  General while you were being sworn in. They have a compassionate care protocol starting
  Monday. Your daughter is first on the list. You don''t need Meridian."


  Okonkwo froze. The color drained from her face, then rushed back in a sudden flush
  of realization. The invisible chains of the blackmail snapped.


  "Mr. Wright," the Judge warned. "Get on with it."


  Thomas returned to the center of the room. He took a breath, locking eyes with the
  witness. "Dr. Okonkwo, let me ask you one last time. Looking at Exhibit 42, is it
  the true record of the adverse reactions, or is it a lie?"


  Okonkwo straightened her spine. She looked at the CEO, then back to Thomas, her
  fear replaced by cold, hard steel.


  "It is a lie," she said, her voice ringing clear. "I altered the data to hide the
  deaths. And they told me to do it."


  The CEO’s smile vanished. Thomas exhaled, the weight of the world lifting from his
  shoulders.'
