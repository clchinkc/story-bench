output: 'Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected
  her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with the
  car.


  "How was Thailand?" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.


  "Amazing. The temples were beautiful. I took so many photos."


  "And the meditation retreat?"


  "It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly." Sophie’s thumb found her phone out
  of habit, the screen lighting up with stacked notifications. She stared at them
  for a beat, then let out a slow breath the way the teacher had made them do—counting,
  feeling the air move. The tightness in her chest didn’t vanish, but it loosened.


  She unlocked the phone anyway. "Oh, great. Three emergencies while I was gone."
  She skimmed the subject lines instead of diving in. "Linda needs me to call her
  tonight."


  "Can''t it wait until morning?"


  Sophie’s pre-Trip self would have said no before the question finished. Now she
  watched the cars ahead, the red taillights smearing in the dusk. "It can wait an
  hour," she said, and, with a small wince, she put the phone face down in her lap.
  "I’ll send Linda a note that I landed and I’ll call first thing. The Pearson account
  won’t manage itself, but neither will I if I start sprinting the moment I touch
  down."


  Her mother glanced over, surprised, then nodded, as if afraid to jinx it.


  They drove in a quieter kind of silence. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through
  the evening haze. Sophie''s apartment building. The coffee shop where she bought
  her morning latte. Everything exactly as she''d left it, and yet it looked less
  like a checklist and more like a place.


  "It''s good to be home," she said, and for once she meant the home part before the
  work. She picked up her phone, typed one short message, hit send, and slid it back
  into her bag.'
