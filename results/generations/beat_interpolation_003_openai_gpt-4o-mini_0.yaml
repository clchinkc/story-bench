output: "Yuki's scanner beeped gently as she made her way through the crew quarters,\
  \ a chill settling in her bones. The narrow corridor was lined with closed doors,\
  \ each labeled with names that echoed in her mind like ghosts. She paused at a window,\
  \ peering into a shared living space, its furniture untouched yet coated in a thin\
  \ layer of dust. A flicker of movement caught her eye—a shadow darted past, too\
  \ quick to be human. Heart pounding, she pressed on, feeling the weight of her own\
  \ breath.\n\nIn the medical bay, the atmosphere shifted. The lights flickered erratically,\
  \ casting sharp angles of light and shadow. Yuki approached a workstation, where\
  \ medical reports lay scattered, detailing the crew’s recent experiments. \"Intra-dimensional\
  \ resonance,\" she murmured, piecing together the implications. Her fingers danced\
  \ over the data, revealing a correlation between the crew's research and the anomalies\
  \ she had witnessed. \n\nThen she heard it—a low, echoing hum, a sound that reverberated\
  \ through the walls. She turned sharply, scanning the room. Suddenly, a figure emerged\
  \ from the shadows, shimmering with an otherworldly glow, eyes glinting with an\
  \ unsettling familiarity. It was a crew member, but not as she remembered. The contours\
  \ of their body flickered, shifting like mirages in the air.\n\n“Yuki…” the figure\
  \ rasped, voice distorted, a blend of recognition and menace. She recoiled, heart\
  \ racing. “Help us…”\n\nDetermined to understand, she fought against her rising\
  \ panic. \"What happened to you?\" she demanded, but the entity only shimmered,\
  \ its features blurring. The air grew thick with despair. \n\nIn the corner of her\
  \ eye, she caught sight of a containment unit, cracked and flickering. It bore the\
  \ label of a failed experiment, and an idea sparked. If she could access the data\
  \ within, it might provide the answers she needed. But as she approached, a surge\
  \ of energy pulsed, sending a shockwave that knocked her back. \n\nGritting her\
  \ teeth, Yuki steadied herself. She had to push through; the truth was within reach.\
  \ She recalibrated her scanner, focusing on the humming core of the unit. The transformed\
  \ crew watched her, their presence both haunting and alluring, as she fought her\
  \ way through the tension, pushing against an unseen barrier, desperate to uncover\
  \ the fate of her colleagues and the price of their ambition."
