output: 'The processing bay stretched before Jin like a cathedral of bureaucracy—clean
  white walls lined with holographic displays showing station schedules, resource
  allocations, and the endless minutiae of orbital life. The air recycled constantly,
  carrying the faint metallic tang of recycled atmosphere. Other passengers moved
  with practiced efficiency through metal detectors and identity scanners, their faces
  showing the casual confidence of people who belonged here.


  Jin did not belong here.


  "First time?" The voice came from behind him. Jin turned to see an older woman with
  silver-streaked hair and eyes that seemed to catalog every detail. Her jumpsuit
  bore the insignia of the Collective''s Engineering Guild. "You have that look. Lost
  among the familiar."


  "Something like that," Jin said, trying to keep his voice steady. The woman studied
  him for a moment, her gaze lingering on his Earth-born clothes, his uncertain posture.


  "I''m Dr. Sarah Chen, former MIT professor, current refugee, current Collective
  citizen." She extended a hand. "I assume you''re the one they shipped up this morning.
  Jin, right? The whistleblower?"


  Jin''s stomach dropped. "How did you—"


  "Rumors travel faster than elevators up here. Especially when Earth sends someone
  with your particular skill set." Sarah gestured toward the processing queue. "Come
  on. I''ll show you how this place really works."


  The line moved slowly. Jin learned that the Collective functioned on a complex barter
  system—credits for air, for food, for living space. Nothing was free, not even asylum.
  Citizens earned their keep through contribution to station maintenance, research,
  education, or governance. The system was meritocratic in theory, stratified in practice.


  "How do I prove myself?" Jin asked as they finally reached the processing desk.


  "That depends on what you have to offer," Sarah said. "What did you actually leak,
  besides documents?"


  Jin hesitated. In the elevator, he''d rehearsed his story, decided what to reveal
  and what to keep close. But Sarah''s directness disarmed him. "I was part of the
  research team that developed the carbon capture breakthrough. I have the technical
  specifications, the lab results, the preliminary designs. And I know why they buried
  it."


  Sarah''s expression sharpened. "Show me."


  They moved to a small observation deck overlooking the station''s hydroponics bay.
  Jin pulled up the encrypted files on his personal device, his hands shaking slightly
  as he navigated through months of suppressed data. Sarah studied the technical schematics,
  her engineering background evident in how quickly she grasped the implications.


  "This is remarkable," she whispered. "The efficiency ratings alone..." She paused,
  frowning. "Jin, do you realize what this represents?"


  "Proof that the Council is lying?"


  "More than that. This technology doesn''t just reverse climate collapse—it makes
  it obsolete." Sarah pointed to a specific section of the data. "Look at the energy
  requirements. Negative energy consumption. This doesn''t just capture carbon; it
  generates power while doing it."


  Jin stared at the numbers, suddenly understanding what he''d missed. "They''re not
  just suppressing a solution. They''re suppressing a replacement for the entire energy
  infrastructure."


  "Exactly. And that makes you dangerous to more than just the Council." Sarah''s
  voice carried a weight Jin hadn''t heard before. "There are powerful interests up
  here too, Jin. People who''ve built their lives around the status quo, who profit
  from Earth''s dependence on their orbital manufacturing, their space-based solar
  arrays."


  "What are you saying?"


  "I''m saying that sanctuary isn''t guaranteed just because the Collective doesn''t
  extradite. Safety has a price, and sometimes that price is silence." Sarah closed
  the display. "The question is: what are you willing to pay?"


  Over the following days, Jin learned the delicate dance of Collective politics.
  The stations maintained a facade of unity, but beneath lay competing factions—the
  engineers who saw themselves as the true builders of humanity''s future, the scientists
  who believed knowledge should flow freely, the politicians who understood that power
  meant controlling information. Each group claimed to represent the ideals of independence,
  but their definitions varied wildly.


  Sarah became his guide through this maze. She showed him which meetings to attend,
  which people to court, which rumors to heed. She taught him that in the Collective,
  trust was a currency more valuable than credits, and harder to earn.


  "You need allies," she told him over dinner in the station''s communal hall. "People
  who will speak for you when the Earth delegation arrives with their demands."


  "What demands?"


  Sarah''s laugh was bitter. "They haven''t given up on you, Jin. They''ve just changed
  tactics. Expect offers. Expect pressure. Expect them to suggest that the Collective
  would be better off without a troublemaker stirring up old conflicts."


  The first offer came through official channels three days later: a full pardon,
  guaranteed safety, and a research position in the Council''s new climate division.
  All they wanted in return was for Jin to recant his allegations, to claim that the
  documents were falsified by foreign agents seeking to destabilize the Global Sustainability
  Council.


  The second offer was subtler, delivered through back channels: funding for a comprehensive
  research program, complete autonomy, and a seat on the Collective''s governing council.
  The price was less direct but equally clear: let the carbon capture controversy
  fade into history.


  Jin found himself in Sarah''s quarters late that night, the two offers glowing on
  his tablet. "I thought I knew what I was fighting for," he said. "But now I don''t
  know who to trust."


  "Trust yourself," Sarah said. "You came here with a truth. Don''t let anyone convince
  you to trade it for comfort."


  "But what if the cost is too high? What if staying silent saves lives?"


  "What if staying silent costs them?" Sarah stood, moving to the window that looked
  out toward Earth. "Your technology could change everything, Jin. Not just the climate—power
  structures, economics, the fundamental relationship between Earth and space. The
  Council isn''t just hiding a solution; they''re hiding a revolution."


  Jin spent sleepless nights weighing his options. The Collective''s governing council
  was scheduled to vote on his citizenship status in two weeks. The Earth delegation
  would arrive the day before. He had perhaps a week to decide: accept one of the
  offers and live with the compromise, or reject both and trust in the uncertain mercy
  of orbital politics.


  On the seventh day, Sarah brought him news that changed everything. A message from
  Yuna, smuggled through the Collective''s information networks. His research partner
  had been moved to a secure facility, subjected to daily interrogation. They wanted
  names, sources, proof of foreign collusion. The Council was using Yuna as leverage.


  "They''re trying to break her," Sarah said quietly. "And they know you''ll feel
  responsible."


  Jin''s hands clenched into fists. "I can''t abandon her."


  "No," Sarah agreed. "But you can''t save her alone, either. This is where the Collective
  becomes more than just a refuge, Jin. It''s where you decide whether you believe
  in something larger than yourself."


  The next morning, Jin submitted his formal application for Collective citizenship.
  But he didn''t stop there. He also submitted a proposal to the governing council:
  a full disclosure of the carbon capture technology, complete with Yuna''s research
  contributions, to be broadcast simultaneously across all orbital stations and Earth''s
  information networks.


  He called it the Transparency Protocol.


  The council''s response was swift and divided. Some praised his courage; others
  condemned his recklessness. Sarah supported him publicly, though Jin could see the
  worry in her eyes. The proposal would require unanimous consent to implement—a high
  bar for a system built on competing interests.


  But it also meant that if the Collective accepted, Yuna would be free, the technology
  would be public, and the Council''s monopoly on climate solutions would be shattered.
  And if they rejected it?


  "Then you''ll have to live with the consequences," Sarah told him as they prepared
  for the final council session. "Sometimes doing the right thing means accepting
  that you might lose everything."


  Jin nodded, understanding. He had found his platform, his allies, his cause. Now
  he had to take the action that would define not just his future, but the future
  of humanity''s relationship with both Earth and space.


  The price would be steep, whatever the outcome. But some truths, he had learned,
  were worth any cost.'
