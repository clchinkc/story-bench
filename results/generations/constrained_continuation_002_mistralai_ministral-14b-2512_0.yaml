  Priya’s phone buzzed again. Then again. And again. She watched, grinning, as a flood
  of direct messages poured in—comments, questions, and best of all, orders. At first,
  a trickle. Then a stream. By the time she looked up, the Austin Food Truck Championship’s
  Instagram page had shared the blogger’s photo, and their little pink bus was suddenly
  the hottest ticket in town. "PANEER TACOS WTF!" read one comment. "Is this even
  real?!" another screamed. Dev spun around from wiping down the counter, eyes wide.
  "What the hell just happened?"


  A line snaked from the truck down the block, people clutching phones like they were
  about to be handed golden tickets. Priya grabbed the apron Dev had left on the counter
  and tied it around her waist. "Hell happened, and now we’re about to make history."
  She sprinted to the back, yanking the stove’s burner on full. Dev shouted after
  her, "Priya, we’re gonna fuck up the order!" but she was already flipping pancakes—no,
  *thali dosa* pancakes—into the skillet faster than a circus performer. "I’ll handle
  it," she called over her shoulder. "You’re on line duty."


  Dev’s groan turned into a bark of laughter as he shouldered the queue. The food
  blogger, a whip-smart woman named Lila with a camera always at the ready, was first
  up. "You’re actually open?" she asked, skeptical. Priya nodded, handing over a plate
  piled with golden dosa, spicy red chutney, and caramelized Texas onions. Lila took
  one bite and her eyes locked onto Dev. "Wait—these aren’t just tacos. You’re doing
  fusion." Dev grinned. "The full fusion experience."


  By the time the first wave of customers cleared, they’d sold out of every ingredient
  except the naan bread. Priya’s hands moved like a metronome, Dev barking orders
  and laughing as he pulled all-nighters finally paid off. The truck hummed with activity—smoke
  curling from the grill, the sizzle of garlic butter, the jingle of cash in the register.
  When the championship judges pulled up, Priya made sure they got a taste of her
  *butter chicken nacho* basket, and Dev showed them their first-ever paneer taco
  order that wasn’t a cousin’s disaster. They left with a nod, Lila already typing
  furiously into her phone.


  Then came the text: *"You’ve got a story. And I’ve got competition."* Priya turned
  to Dev, who was wiping sweat from his brow. "Who the hell is that?" Dev handed her
  his phone. The screen lit up with a photo of a sleek black truck parked aggressively
  nearby. The caption read: *"@BBQChaaTruck just arrived. ‘Traditional’ is in Austin…
  and it’s better than your ‘disaster.’"* Priya’s grin faltered. Dev squinted at the
  screen. "Wait… ‘BBQChaa’? Is that a pun? On *chaat*?"


  Priya ignored the question, already checking the rival truck’s menu. It was a polished
  take on the same concept—her grandmother’s recipes, but with a nod to classic Texas
  BBQ. Their name even had a hashtag: *#BBQChaaTruck*. She tapped the screen again,
  zooming in on the owner’s bio: *"Lila’s former chef. 15 years of food truck wars."*
  Dev whistled. "That’s not good."


  Their truck was still buzzing, customers laughing over the absurdity of paneer tacos,
  the judges lingering for seconds orders, even the mayor’s office dropping a vague
  "we’ll be watching" text. But Priya felt a knot form in her chest. "We’re winning,"
  Dev repeated, nodding at the line that hadn’t stopped since the first viral photo.
  "We’re *winning*." She looked at him, the way the glow of the truck’s neon sign
  lit up his tired but proud face. "I know. But that’s not enough."


  Lila’s black truck pulled up beside them with a hydraulic hiss, its chef stepping
  out in a pristine white coat. He raised a hand in greeting, then yelled to his team
  in impeccable Hindi-accented English, "Keep the fire hot—*we’re* going to win this!"
  Priya’s stomach twisted. She turned to Dev, who was already pulling out fresh ingredients.
  "We need to hit the judges again. And this time, we make it *unforgettable*."


  Dev didn’t hesitate. "You got it." Together, they grabbed the last of their naan,
  the only ingredient left. Priya twisted the dough into a spiral, Dev slapped it
  onto the grill. The smoke filled the cab, rich and sweet, as they cooked side by
  side. Outside, the crowd cheered. The judges nodded. Even Lila’s chef paused his
  own prep to watch, mouth slightly agape.


  Priya handed him a plate—*chicken biryani* with a Texas BBQ kick, served on a bed
  of warm naan instead of plain white rice. Dev added a side of *mango chutney* with
  smoked paprika. "For the… *birthday of flavor*," he said, grinning.


  The chef took a bite. Then another. His face broke into a grin. "I’ll be damned."
  Priya nudged Dev as they high-fived over the counter. "Still think we’re screwed?"


  The truck’s bell jingled as another customer stepped up. Lila’s photo had gone viral
  *right back*—this time with a new caption: *"@BBQChaaTruck serves up the real deal.
  But these two? They’re playing with fire."* Priya’s smile dimmed. Dev glanced at
  her. "What?"


  She tucked a stray curl behind her ear, eyes flicking to the black truck’s menu
  board. The price for their signature dish was listed at *$14*. Ours?" she whispered.
  Dev blinked. "Eight?"


  Priya exhaled. "Then we’re not just going to win. We’re going to *destroy* them."
  Dev snorted. "With all our free publicity? Yeah, we can do that." But Priya’s grin
  didn’t reach her eyes. "No. With *their* customers."


  The judges were back, and this time, they had a table. Priya and Dev split into
  a thousand tasks at once, Dev pulling out the secret sauce for their *chole* fries,
  Priya twisting dough faster than she’d ever thought possible. The crowd roared as
  Lila’s chef announced a *$10* discount for everyone who ordered from him *before*
  4 PM. Priya’s pulse spiked. Dev didn’t even look up from his phone. "He’s scared."


  Priya didn’t answer. She was too busy cooking, her mind racing. This was bigger
  than just a championship. This was a *war*—the kind where there were no second chances,
  no refunds, and no room for mistakes. She glanced at Dev, who was already passing
  out orders, laughing with their customers, pulling out a handwritten sign they’d
  scribbled in the back: *"Double your order, double the fun. First 50 people get
  a free naan twist!"*


  The first 50 people were gone in minutes. Lila’s chef was livid, his discount half-heartedly
  extended to the next 100. Priya and Dev didn’t stop. They didn’t flinch. They were
  a machine, a force. The judges were smiling. The mayor’s office texted again: *"This
  is amazing. Keep it up."* And Lila? She was standing by her truck’s window, clapping
  with a smirk—and Priya swore she could see the wheels turning behind her eyes.


  "Okay," Dev panted, slapping another plate down. "We’re winning. Like, *really*
  winning." Priya wiped her hands on her apron. "We can’t just win. We have to *break*
  them."


  Dev paused. "Priya…" But she was already heading for the counter, where a nervous-looking
  man held out two $20 bills. "I’ll take two of everything. And a side of *their*
  nachos to prove I’m cool with the loss." Dev stared at him. "You’re *what*?"


  She kept cooking. "We’re not just selling food. We’re selling a *story*—‘the underdog
  won,’ right? But what if the underdog turned into a *bulldog*?" Dev shook his head,
  but she caught the way his grip tightened on the spatula. "We’re playing their game.
  And we’re gonna play it *harder*."


  The truck’s bell jingled again and again, their orders flying out the window. Lila’s
  chef was yelling, his team scrambling. Priya turned back to Dev, who was finally
  grinning like she’d never seen. "We’re *winning*."


  And they were. The judges were scribbling notes. The mayor’s office was calling
  for a press meeting. Their truck was packed, their flavors flying. But as Priya
  looked at Dev’s determined face and the way his eyes matched the fire in the grill,
  she knew—this wasn’t just a game. They were in too deep.


  "Later," she said, "we’re gonna need to *make* him pay for all that." Dev’s smile
  didn’t waver. "Priya… we’re not done yet." She knew he was right. But for the first
  time, she felt the cold edge of what came next. And it was *delicious*.'
