output: 'The Grand Prix roared beyond the Tsarina''s glittering decks, a bass thrum
  beneath champagne flutes and murmured deals. Miri Delacroix adjusted her diamond
  choker, her gaze sweeping the oligarch''s garish salon. "Sorokin collects provenance
  like he collects enemies," she murmured into her comm. "Carelessly." Javier, resplendent
  in stolen tuxedo charm, executed a flawless stumble, dousing a guard in Dom Pérignon.
  Distraction achieved. Above, Anya spidered through an air duct, bypassing laser
  grids with silent grace. Miri approached the Renaissance masterpiece—*Madonna of
  the Pomegranate*, looted from Amsterdam grandparents she’d never meet. Her fingers
  danced over a tablet disguised as a clutch. "Alarm disengaged. Leo, status on the
  display case?"


  "Pressure-sensitive floor tiles activated," Leo’s voice crackled, strained from
  the security closet. "Didn’t show on blueprints. Thermal overlay shows... gaps?"
  Anya dropped soundlessly, landing on the balls of her feet between sensors. "Like
  hopscotch for felons," she grinned, disabling the case lock. Miri swapped canvas
  for forgery, the original rolling snug into her custom-lined clutch. Smooth. Almost.
  Leo hissed, "Secondary motion sensors just pinged near the starboard galley. Minor
  sweep team incoming." Miri’s dry chuckle masked her pulse. "Time for Javier’s encore.
  Tell him to ‘accidentally’ ignite the caviar station."


  Victory tasted like salt air and adrenaline as Miri melted into the crowd, clutch
  heavy with justice. Through a bank of monitors near the bar, Sorokin’s security
  feed flickered. There—a woman in austere black, directing guards with glacial precision.
  Dr. Evelyn Thorne. Miri’s breath seized. Her mentor. The architect of her ruin.
  Thorne’s eyes met hers via the screen, a ghostly recognition. The comms erupted:
  "All teams, intruders confirmed. Lockdown sectors three through five." The yacht’s
  engines deepened, vibrations humming through the deck as external gates whirred
  shut. The Grand Prix’s cacophony faded beneath the thud of sealed bulkheads. Leo’s
  voice, high with panic: "She’s rerouting systems! I’ve lost primary control—" The
  heist wasn’t theft anymore. It was a reckoning. Miri’s knuckles whitened on the
  clutch. Thorne knew every move she’d make.


  Alarms blared, crimson lights staining the opulence. Guards converged, radios crackling
  Thorne’s directives. "She’s hunting us like lost Rembrandts," Javier spat, ducking
  a patrol. "We need to bolt!" Anya vaulted a chaise longue, but Leo’s cry cut through:
  "They’ve breached security! I’m cornered!" On Miri’s tablet, Leo’s vitals spiked—a
  biometric feed from his watch, another of his clever hacks now broadcasting his
  terror. Thorne’s face filled a nearby screen, smiling. "Miriam. Still sentimental
  about strays?" The painting weighed like stone in Miri’s grip. Revenge whispered:
  *Thorne’s vulnerable, starboard deck*. But Leo’s feed flashed red—guards seconds
  away. The pressure-sensitive floor tiles near the salon exit glowed faintly on her
  display. Anya could cross; guards couldn’t. Miri’s choice crystallized. "Javier,
  create chaos portside. Anya—get Leo. *Now*." She sprinted not toward Thorne, but
  toward the sensors, tossing a decoy beacon toward the starboard shadows. Loyalty
  over vengeance. The tiles flared as guards charged, sealing exits with a shriek
  of metal. Gallows humor tinged Leo’s gasp over comms: "Next time, Miri... remind
  me to pack a parachute."'
