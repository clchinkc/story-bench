output: "Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare at 6:47 PM, right on schedule. She collected\
  \ her bags from the carousel and walked out to where her mother was waiting with\
  \ the car.\n\n\"How was Thailand?\" her mother asked as they pulled onto the highway.\n\
  \n\"Amazing,\" Sophie said, watching the city lights flicker. \"The temples were\
  \ beautiful, but the stillness was what I really needed.\"\n\n\"And the meditation\
  \ retreat?\"\n\n\"It was... intense. A lot of sitting quietly.\" Sophie's phone\
  \ vibrated with a frantic rhythm in her cup holder. She glanced at the screen: three\
  \ 'high priority' emails from Linda about the Pearson account. \"Linda says there\
  \ are three emergencies,\" Sophie noted, though her pulse didn't quicken.\n\n\"\
  Can't it wait until morning?\" her mother asked, her grip tightening slightly on\
  \ the steering wheel as she braced for Sophie’s usual frantic response.\n\n\"You\
  \ know how it is,\" Sophie said. But instead of typing a reply or calling Linda,\
  \ she reached out and switched the device to silent, sliding it deep into her purse.\
  \ \"But yes. It can wait. I’m not even back in the office until Monday.\"\n\nThey\
  \ drove in a comfortable silence. The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through\
  \ the evening haze. Sophie saw the steel and glass not as a checklist of demands\
  \ or a cage of deadlines, but as a backdrop to the life she was finally reclaiming.\
  \ She looked at her apartment building and the coffee shop where she used to rush\
  \ through her mornings, seeing them now with a strange, peaceful detachment.\n\n\
  \"It's good to be home,\" she said. \n\nShe leaned her head against the cool glass\
  \ of the window, content to simply watch the world go by without feeling the need\
  \ to manage it. For the first time in years, the city felt quiet."
