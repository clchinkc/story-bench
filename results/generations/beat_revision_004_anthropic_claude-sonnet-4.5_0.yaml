output: 'Detective Rachel Torres spread twelve years of cold case files across her
  desk, comparing witness statements from the Moreno disappearance. Tuesday mornings
  meant the precinct was quiet—most detectives started late after weekend arrests.
  She preferred it this way.


  "Still chasing ghosts?" Detective James Oyelaran set a coffee on her desk, black,
  no sugar. Three years working together meant he knew better than to argue about
  the cases everyone else had abandoned.


  "This witness changed her story twice in 2018." Rachel tapped the highlighted sections.
  "Nobody followed up."


  James leaned over her shoulder, scanning the documents. "Because Moreno''s brother
  confessed."


  "Wrong brother confessed." She pulled up a photo on her phone—not case evidence,
  but the orange tabby sprawled across her Queens apartment couch. "Even Sherlock
  could spot the inconsistencies."


  "You named your cat after Holmes and you still want me to believe you''re not obsessed."
  But James was already reading the file, that familiar crease between his eyebrows.
  He trusted her instincts, even when they led down rabbit holes.


  "Found him at a scene two Octobers ago," Rachel said, still scrolling through the
  statements. "Someone''s elderly neighbor died, cat was starving. Nobody else wanted
  to deal with it."


  "Of course you took him." James straightened, pulling out his phone. "I''ll call
  the DA''s office, see if anyone remembers why they accepted the confession so fast."


  Rachel felt the familiar pull, the tension of a thread ready to unravel. October
  morning light filtered through the precinct windows, illuminating the dust motes
  above her perfectly organized chaos. This was her ordinary—cold coffee, colder cases,
  and a partner who''d learned to follow her down these paths.


  She didn''t know this particular Tuesday would be different.


  She didn''t know that by evening, one of these cold cases would become urgent, terrifying,
  and personal.'
