output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. Its voice didn''t echo in the
  cavern; it resonated inside her skull, cold and mocking. "You couldn''t even save
  your brother. You survived because you were a coward, and you will die because you
  are weak."


  Kira’s breath hitched. She thought of her village, of her brother''s death, of the
  way his hand had slipped from hers in the dark. The memory wasn''t a source of strength
  anymore; it was a leaden weight of guilt. She raised her sword and charged, but
  her movements were sluggish, burdened by the shame she’d carried since that night.


  The battle was brutal. Flame scorched her armor. Claws raked across her shield.
  Three times she was knocked down by the dragon’s tail, and three times she rose
  again, each time slower, her spirit fracturing under the weight of the dragon’s
  psychological assault. On the fourth fall, she stayed down. The obsidian beast loomed
  over her, a physical manifestation of her own self-loathing. All felt lost; she
  was the girl in the dark again, helpless and small.


  In that hollow moment of "death," Kira stopped fighting the memory. She accepted
  the cold truth: she had failed him, but that failure did not define her end. She
  realized her guilt was the dragon''s only real power over her. As she surrendered
  her fear of the past, a strange, cold clarity washed over her—a rebirth of purpose.
  She wasn''t the girl who let him die; she was the survivor who would ensure he hadn''t
  died for nothing.


  Finally, when the dragon overextended on a strike, she saw her opening. With the
  last of her strength, she drove her sword through the gap in its scales, piercing
  its heart.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  victorious but exhausted. The weight in her chest hadn''t vanished, but it had settled
  into a steady anchor of resolve.


  "I did it," she whispered. "I actually did it."


  She retrieved her sword and began the long walk back to camp, her stride no longer
  trembling, ready to tell the others the good news.'
