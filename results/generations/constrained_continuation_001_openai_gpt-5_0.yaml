output: 'Tomás shouldered through a curtain of goat skins, then pressed his palm to
  a cracked mosaic of sunbursts. Stone whispered. A seam yawned. Cool air licked Zara’s
  cheeks as they slipped into a narrow corridor ribbed with age. The market noise
  sealed behind them like a lid.


  “The Approach,” Tomás said, recovering breath. “Older than the Guild. Older than
  the city.”


  The torch he carried threw gold along carvings of stylized eyes and gears. Zara
  tugged the map free long enough to confirm the script—short lines sketched like
  ribs—then tucked it back. Her fingers were steadier than her heart.


  The corridor widened into a low hall laced with brass plates and raised tiles. She
  crouched, palm hovering over the floor, reading it like a lockface. The plates wore
  a faint polish at their edges. The safe path threaded unevenly.


  “They think the Library keeps people out with riddles,” she muttered. “It’s grocers’
  scales in stone.”


  “How do you—”


  “Watch my feet.” She took coins from her purse, flicked them. A loud clink on one
  tile, a dull thunk on another. She mapped the music, then stepped, heel-toe, heel-toe,
  weight on the silent squares. Tomás mirrored, trembling.


  Halfway across, a hinge groaned. Somewhere unseen, counterweights dropped. A portcullis
  slashed down from the ceiling. Zara dove; rolled on the far side, iron teeth grazing
  her spine. Tomás wasn’t fast enough. The grate slammed shut on his satchel strap,
  pinning him. He clawed at leather, eyes gone wide.


  “Leave it,” she said, already reaching for her wire.


  “My notes,” he said, voice breaking. Behind them, from the dark, bootfalls scraped—the
  Guild, patient as ants.


  An easy thing, to slip into the side passage just ahead, to vanish and leave the
  scholar to be the Guild’s problem. Survival had always been subtraction. Her mother’s
  cough tilted through her like a blade. Failure wasn’t a knife in the gut here; it
  was a desert that never ended.


  She went back. Her wire kissed the rusted lock on the grate. The tumblers were ancient,
  their teeth ground soft by grit. She closed her eyes and let sound bloom in her
  ear—the faint shiver when the pick met the false set, the true click buried like
  a swallowed word. Her hands remembered broken locks in flophouse doors, market stalls
  with greedy latches. She feathered the torque, moved the pin a breath. Click. Click.
  The last one stuck; sweat ran down her neck. Boots grew louder. Tomás was murmuring
  something, prayer or apology. She exhaled and eased the pressure. The final click
  gave. The grate lifted a finger. She shoved her shoulder under, blood screaming,
  and dragged him—and the satchel—free.


  They ran into a tunnel that smelled like old rain. Only when the footsteps behind
  fell away into echoes did Tomás stop. In the jittering torchlight, shame remade
  his face.


  “I lied,” he said. “Not about the Library. About why I’m helping you.”


  Zara watched him without a word. The map crackled in her vest like a caught breath.


  “I was part of the Council’s last expedition,” he said. “We found the outer rooms.
  I decoded seals as if they were puzzles and not warnings. Five people died because
  I wanted to be the man who brought back impossible knowledge. The Council wanted
  weapons. I brought them a catalog. They used it to choke medicine in the slums—your
  slums. I’m disgraced because I tried to burn the index. I couldn’t. I need you because
  you don’t worship books. Because you can do what I can’t.”


  “You think I’ll torch the cure if it means keeping them from it,” she said, flat.


  “I think you’ll choose for someone besides yourself. I think you already did.”


  The tunnel ended in a round chamber. A black pool lay in its center, perfectly still.
  On the far side sat an iron door with a blank face, no keyhole, no handle. Beside
  the pool: a lever set low, submerged to the wrist in algae.


  Tomás swallowed. “The Ordeal. The old notes say the door opens only while the gate
  resets. The lever’s under the grate.”


  “How long?”


  “Long enough to drown,” he said. “Short enough to live.”


  She looked at the water. It held the torchlight without reflection, an eye refusing
  to blink. Her breath shortened. If she failed here, if she miscounted or lost her
  nerve, there would be no second attempt, no rations to stretch, no bargain to make.
  There would be only the steady cough of a dying woman in a room far above, growing
  softer until even memory refused to carry it.


  “Hold the torch,” she said.


  She slid into the water. Cold knifed her. It was a cold that didn’t care if you
  were brave. She dove, fingers scraping slime-slick stone until they found metal.
  The lever fought; she put her weight on it, lungs tightening. Gears began to move,
  a grinding under her bones. Sand sifted from slots above—filling, blinding. The
  world became pressure, darkness, the drumbeat in her chest turning arrhythmic.


  Let go, the body begged.


  She thought of the slums’ alleys, of bolts yielding to patient hands, of her mother’s
  knuckles pale against a chipped bowl. She wasn’t just a thief. Thieves took. Thieves
  left. She had gone back for a man who might yet betray her. She pulled again. The
  lever slammed to its seat. Somewhere, heavy iron started to rise.


  She pushed off. For a heartbeat the black pressed her flat. It felt like burial—stone
  on ribs, the cold telling her she was small. The thought came, simple and terrible:
  If I die here, I will have died still running from failure instead of through it.


  Then her hand broke the surface. She came up coughing, spitting, it all tearing
  out of her—the water, the panic, the version of herself that thought control was
  the same as safety. Tomás hauled her to the edge. Behind them, the iron door creaked
  open.


  They stumbled through as it began to lower. The chamber on the other side was long
  and spare, its walls lined with sealed niches, each etched with the same eye and
  gear. The air tasted like old paper and minted coin. Zara felt emptied and lit at
  once. Something inside had burned away.


  “We’re close,” Tomás whispered. Awe and dread braided his voice.


  A slow clap answered from the gloom. Figures stepped from a side passage, scorpion
  sigils gleaming oily in the half-light. Their leader wore a veil, her hands clean
  as a priest’s.


  “Very close,” she said. “Thank you for showing us how.”


  Behind Zara, the door clanged shut. Ahead, knives caught the light. The Approach
  was over. The true price was just beginning.'
