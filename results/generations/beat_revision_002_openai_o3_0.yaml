output: "Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate\
  \ the community center. For fifteen years he’d patched leaking roofs, taught jump-shots,\
  \ and kept kids off the streets, but one signature from the council had erased it\
  \ all.\n\n\"There has to be something we can do,\" said Denise.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\
  \ Marcus slumped into his chair.\n\nShe opened her tablet. “About the fundraiser—you\
  \ should cancel.”  \nHe frowned. \"What?\"  \n“The vendor sponsorships pulled out\
  \ once the developer bought them. And the grant? Rejected an hour ago. I just read\
  \ the email.” She swallowed. “I’ve accepted a position with their outreach division.\
  \ It’s—it's triple the pay, Marcus, and my mother’s medical bills—”\n\nThe words\
  \ scattered like glass. Denise, the last pillar of the program, was leaving for\
  \ the enemy.\n\nHe rubbed his temples. Blood pounded behind his eyes, louder than\
  \ the distant echoes of kids playing basketball down the hall—kids who didn’t yet\
  \ know their sanctuary was already a corpse.\n\nA voicemail notification blinked\
  \ on his phone: his wife’s attorney. Rent overdue, utilities cut; she had taken\
  \ the children to her sister’s until “he got back on his feet.” The screen dimmed,\
  \ the room seemed to shrink.\n\nMarcus rose, walked to the cracked window overlooking\
  \ the court, and watched the afternoon session end. One by one the lights snapped\
  \ off, plunging the gym into darkness. No cheers, no dribbling, just the hum of\
  \ the exit sign—an obituary written in neon.\n\nHe had nothing left."
