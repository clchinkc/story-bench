output: 'Her scanner hummed, painting the empty crew quarters in stark green outlines.
  Personal effects lay scattered – a half-read data pad on a bunk, a discarded uniform
  jacket, a family photo tucked into a console. No signs of struggle, no forced entry.
  Just… absence. The air was still, thick with the metallic tang of recycled oxygen.
  Yuki frowned. This wasn''t a mass evacuation.


  In the mess hall, she found a half-eaten meal, the nutrient paste solidified in
  its tray. A game of stellar chess was abandoned mid-move on a communal table. Whatever
  happened, it happened fast. Her scanner suddenly blipped, detecting an anomalous
  energy signature emanating from the adjacent research wing.


  She followed the signal, her boots echoing down sterile corridors. As she neared
  the bio-labs, a flicker of movement caught her periphery – a distortion in the air,
  like heat haze, vanishing the instant she turned her head. A trick of the light?
  Or her overactive imagination? The station’s silence pressed in.


  Lab 4 was a mess, equipment overturned, nutrient vats cracked. On a terminal, a
  frantic log entry scrolled: "...unstable phase shifts... subjects exhibiting dimensional
  bleed-through... losing cohesion..." A chill snaked up Yuki’s spine. The energy
  signature intensified, leading her to a heavily reinforced door: "Research Lab Seven
  – Restricted Access."


  The door was locked, security protocols overriding her access codes. A surge of
  frustration, then determination. She located a maintenance panel, bypassed the circuit
  with a delicate splice of wires and a precisely calibrated energy pulse from her
  scanner. The heavy door hissed open. Inside, a faint, almost imperceptible hum filled
  the air, and a shimmer danced at the edge of her vision, a whisper brushing her
  ear. She was closer.'
