  Zara skidded around a sharp corner of a tunnel carved into the salt-slick walls,
  her breath ragged and her stolen boots slipping on the uneven floor. Tomás didn’t
  slow—he dragged her forward, his grip iron, his voice a low hiss of warning. "The
  Approach isn’t just a path," he panted. "It’s a test. The Guild carved this place
  with their own rules." Ahead, the flickering torchlight revealed a narrow corridor,
  its ceiling jagged with stalactites that looked like the outstretched claws of the
  very monsters hunting them. Zara yanked her arm free and rolled to a stop, pressing
  her back against the wall as she listened. The scorpion-cloaks were still coming,
  their footsteps muffled but growing louder, closer. Too close. She could smell the
  desert-dust clinging to their armor, the faint metallic tang of sweat beneath it.


  Tomás’s fingers clawed at the wall. "This isn’t just about the Library anymore."
  He turned to her, his face half-lit by the sickening glow of the torches. The truth
  dripped from his words like water from a stalactite, slow and inevitable. "The Guild
  doesn’t *want* anyone to reach it—they’ve been feeding on its books for a hundred
  years. But not the way they think. These texts don’t just hold knowledge. They hold
  *power*. And I—I know how to unlock it."


  Zara’s stomach twisted. "You’re lying."


  "No." His voice was raw. "I saw the carvings in the old scrolls. The Approach isn’t
  a death trap for them—it’s a sieve. They’re meant to *fail*. That’s how they keep
  the weak from stumbling into what’s theirs by right." He pressed a palm against
  her chest, not hard, but enough to feel desperate. "But you’re not weak, Zara. You
  *never* were."


  The words cut deeper than the blade at her belt. She’d spent her life hiding in
  the shadows of the slums, then the market, whispering to herself that she was strong
  enough—smart enough, fast enough—to survive. But this wasn’t just about surviving
  anymore.


  A trapdoor groaned ahead, its edge rusted into the wall. Tomás crouched, his voice
  dropping to a growl. "Three days. You’ve lasted longer than most. But if we don’t
  prove ourselves here, they’ll gut us like rats and take the Library for themselves."
  His fingers closed around hers, pulling her toward the hole. "Your choice: run back
  to the surface where they’ll catch us, or trust me."


  Zara hesitated. The surface meant the air, the light, the chance to lose herself
  in the crowd. But the Approach meant something worse—something that could break
  her. She took a breath, the kind that always came before a jump from a roof into
  a thieving alley, the kind that kept her pulse steady when her fingers trembled.
  "Then we prove them wrong."


  The moment she said it, the torches ahead flared. A net of blackened silk dropped
  across the tunnel like a shroud, snagging on the stalactites. Zara barely had time
  to curse before she dove into the gap, her knife flashing as she sliced at the ropes
  holding the net taut. Behind her, Tomás’s body hit the trapdoor with a sickening
  thud. The net held—he wasn’t going anywhere. She twisted, lunging back, and caught
  his wrist just as the first scorpion-cloaks reached them. "Go!" he snarled, but
  she didn’t let go.


  The torches swung into place. The tunnel ahead was a dead end, unless they climbed
  the crumbling wall of salt—a climb that would leave them open to arrows or worse.
  Zara’s mind raced, her thief’s instincts taking over. The net had been woven from
  Guild standards, not just silk. "There’s a weak spot in the middle," she whispered,
  running her thumb over the frayed edges. "It’ll hold us if we—"


  A blade grazed her shoulder before she could finish. Pain bloomed hot, and she gritted
  her teeth as she sawed at the net. The salt beneath her fingers crumbled like stale
  bread, and she dug her toes into the wall, pulling herself up even as the weight
  of Tomás yanked her back down. "I can’t carry you *and* climb!"


  Tomás’s teeth were clenched, his free hand clawing into the dirt. "I *know* that."


  She didn’t mean to push him. This was the kind of reckless hope that had gotten
  her into trouble before. But the arrows were coming now, thudding into the wall
  with a dull rain. "Move!"


  Tomás obeyed—only to leap upward, not into the net, but toward the ceiling. A stalactite,
  jagged and heavy, hung just above his reach. He clawed at it, and with a heart-stopping
  crack, it broke free. The stone swung like a wrecking ball, and Zara barely had
  time to flinch before it smashed into the waiting guards, their screams swallowed
  by the dust and debris. The tunnel went dark for a moment, then the torches flickered
  back to life, now dimmed by the salt clouds.


  Breathing hard, Zara studied Tomás’s face. His hands were bleeding where he’d gripped
  the stone, but his eyes were bright—not with pain, but with something worse. Exhilaration.
  He’d *known*. He’d known the risks, the cost, and he’d still chosen. "Why?" she
  demanded, hauling herself up the wall.


  Tomás followed, his movements less fluid than hers. "Because I’m not the scholar
  they think I was." His voice was a rasp. "I was their *scribe*. Their historian.
  I wrote the stories they used to scare people off." He stopped at the ledge, his
  chest heaving. "And I know they’ll read this path wrong. They’ll think the Approach
  is a test of strength, but it’s not." He grabbed the net, his fingers slipping in
  the blood from her shoulder. "It’s a test of *wits*."


  Zara’s throat closed. She’d spent years proving she was strong. Fast. But never
  smart enough to get out of the slums for good. Never smart enough to *protect* what
  mattered. "What do we do?"


  His grin was sharp. "We become the stories they expect—and then we *outlie* them."


  Below, the net was taut, just enough to hold a desperate weight. Zara wrapped her
  fingers around the silk, testing it. "This’ll only work once."


  "Then we don’t get caught a second time."


  A shadow moved behind her. Tomás’s eyes widened. "The Guardian’s coming. It’s the
  next test. A riddle, or a blade, or both." He pressed his mouth close to her ear,
  the words rough. "You have to solve it, Zara. Not me. Not this time."


  She nodded, her jaw tight. The Guardian was a relic of the Scorpion’s own making,
  a creature of salt and old magic, its single red eye fixed on the tunnel’s exit.
  It spoke in a language of clanging stones and rusted iron, but she’d learned to
  read the pauses between words, the way the air itself seemed to whisper. Tomás was
  right—this was about the books, about the power they held. And if the Guild thought
  the Approach was about brute force, then they’d never see her coming.


  The Guardian’s claws scraped the salt floor as it stalked forward, its movements
  slow but deliberate. Zara swallowed hard, her knife useless against this. The approach
  to the Inmost Cave wasn’t about steel—it was about something else. Something she’d
  never had to use before.


  Think, she told herself.


  The Guardian stopped, its eye locked onto hers. Then it spoke—not in words, but
  in the echo of a blade cutting silk. The net below was the answer. It wanted them
  to leave it, to prove their skill. But Tomás’s life was still tangled in hers.


  "I’ll make it fast," she said, her voice steadier than she felt. "You climb first."


  Tomás stared at her, then nodded. He cut away, the net collapsing as the Guardian’s
  claws swiped through the air. Zara pressed forward, her feet sure even as her blood
  roared in her ears. She *had* to be smart enough. She *had* to be.


  The Guardian lunged.


  She leapt to the side, rolling as it passed, and snagged a fallen torch. The firelight
  struck across the Guardian’s scales, and in that instant, she saw it—not just the
  beast, but the *mechanism* beneath it. Rust. Old gears. A hinge, barely holding.
  The Approach *was* a test, but not of strength. Of *sight*.


  She hurled the torch.


  It struck true, landing in the Guardian’s eye. The creature shrieked as the salt
  caught fire, but the flames didn’t spread—they *frosted*. The salt turned to ice,
  and the Guardian’s movements locked. It turned, its claws scraping the wall, but
  Zara was already moving, her fingers finding the weak spot in its armor. She jammed
  the knife home, not deep enough to kill, but enough to stop it. Enough to make it
  *fall*.


  The Guardian crashed, its body a twisted mess of rust and ice. Tomás was already
  waiting for her, his hand outstretched. She took it, pulling herself up the jagged
  wall, and when they reached the top, they didn’t pause. They ran.


  The passage beyond was a maze of symbols carved into the walls, each one pulsing
  faintly. "The riddle isn’t in the words," Tomás said, his voice shaking but triumphant.
  "It’s in the *spaces* between them." He pointed to a crescent moon etched above
  a serpent’s coil. "Look here."


  Zara wiped the sweat from her eyes, her thumb brushing the dried blood on her shoulder.
  She’d never been good at reading—not like him, not like the scholars who’d looked
  down on her. But she’d spent her life *listening*, learning the lies beneath the
  words. The symbols weren’t just warnings—they were a map. And the spaces? They were
  the parts they *didn’t* want her to see.


  The cure for her mother wasn’t about brute force. It wasn’t about strength. It was
  about *knowing*—the kind of knowing the Guild feared. The kind that made her more
  dangerous than any blade.


  She took a breath, the kind that came before the real fight.


  The Sunken Library waited ahead, hidden in the darkest depths. And for the first
  time, Zara felt she could reach it.'
