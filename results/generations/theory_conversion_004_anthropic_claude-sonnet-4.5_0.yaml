output: "Zoe Chen was seventeen and invisible. She spent her summers shelving books\
  \ at the Millbrook Public Library, where quiet was guaranteed and people's stories\
  \ stayed safely bound in paper. She liked it that way. She could disappear. She\
  \ could rehearse ordering coffee six times in her head before approaching the counter.\
  \ She could be small.\n\nBut something was missing. She read about people who lived—really\
  \ lived—while she watched from the sidelines, a ghost in the stacks. She consumed\
  \ other people's courage like oxygen, never quite knowing how to breathe it herself.\n\
  \nWhen Ms. Okafor, the new librarian, announced an oral history program to interview\
  \ Millbrook's oldest residents, Zoe felt that familiar pull between wanting and\
  \ fear. Ms. Okafor found her hiding behind the reference section. \"I saw you reading\
  \ Terkel's 'Working,'\" she said, handing Zoe a recorder. \"You understand why stories\
  \ matter. Just try one interview.\"\n\nSo Zoe went. Bernard Park, eighty-nine, Korean\
  \ War veteran, sixty years in Millbrook. She showed up terrified, questions written\
  \ on index cards she couldn't stop shuffling.\n\nThe search was clumsy at first.\
  \ She fumbled with the recording equipment. She asked surface questions and got\
  \ surface answers. Her mother pushed her to get a \"real\" job, one that looked\
  \ good on college applications. She almost quit three times. But she kept showing\
  \ up, kept listening. By the fifth interview, something shifted. Bernard stopped\
  \ giving rehearsed answers. He started trusting the silence between them. And Zoe\
  \ realized listening wasn't passive—it was its own kind of courage.\n\nThen one\
  \ afternoon, Bernard said, \"I never told anyone what really happened in Korea.\
  \ Not my wife, not my kids. But you—you ask the right questions.\" He wanted to\
  \ tell her everything, the survival and the guilt and the grace he'd found in the\
  \ years after. But only if she'd share his story publicly. \"These stories deserve\
  \ witnesses,\" he said.\n\nThe town hall presentation arrived like a reckoning.\
  \ A hundred people filled the community center. Zoe, who couldn't order coffee without\
  \ rehearsing, stood at the microphone with Bernard's words in her hands and her\
  \ heart hammering against her ribs. She gave voice to his truth. She made them listen.\
  \ When she finished, Bernard shook her hand, his eyes wet. \"You heard me,\" he\
  \ said. \"That's all any of us want.\"\n\nThe summer ended. The program concluded.\
  \ But Zoe kept visiting Bernard, kept recording. When he passed in October, his\
  \ family asked her to speak at the funeral. \n\nShe returned to the ordinary world—same\
  \ library, same quiet, same shelves—but she wasn't the same girl who'd hidden there.\
  \ Standing at Bernard's funeral, she didn't speak his words. She spoke her own,\
  \ about what he'd taught her: that listening is a gift, that courage lives in connection,\
  \ that invisible people become real when someone truly sees them.\n\nSenior year,\
  \ Zoe applied to journalism programs. Her essay was about Millbrook's forgotten\
  \ voices—and about the girl who'd found her own voice by honoring theirs. She still\
  \ rehearsed before ordering coffee. But she could stand before strangers, hold space\
  \ for their stories, and make them matter. The change wasn't that she'd stopped\
  \ being afraid. It was that she'd learned fear didn't have to mean silence."
