output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes.
  Steam curled from its nostrils, heat rippling the air between them.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. Then its voice slipped lower,
  intimate as a whisper inside her skull. Stronger warriors have tried, it seemed
  to purr, and your brother died because you hesitated. You led him to the edge and
  let the dark take him.


  The accusation struck harder than flame. Kira’s grip faltered; the sword tip kissed
  stone. She saw the cliff again, the failing rope, her fingers slick with rain. She
  heard his last breath. The dragon exhaled shadow, and it poured into her—cold, suffocating,
  a tide that made the world thin and far away.


  Fire lashed; she raised her shield too slow. Claws hammered her back. She fell once,
  twice, a third time—and each time she dragged herself upright, more by stubborn
  memory than strength. The chasm loomed close, a mouth waiting to swallow her as
  it had swallowed him. A single slip and she would be gone, and for a heartbeat she
  welcomed it. Let the dark take me too.


  That was the death of her—of the part that believed she could undo the past by bleeding
  enough. She knelt, fire hissing around her, and let the guilt crest through her
  without fighting it. I failed him. I loved him. I cannot change it. The words were
  ash and then air. When she rose, the tremor in her hands was gone.


  “You haunt what hurts,” she said, meeting those burning eyes. “But hurt isn’t truth.”


  The dragon lunged. This time she did not flinch from the heat or the memory behind
  it. She watched the rhythm of its rage, the narrow seam where plates flexed when
  it drew breath to speak. Finally, when the dragon overextended on a strike, she
  saw her opening. With the last of her strength, she drove her sword through the
  gap in its scales, piercing its heart.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  not cleansed of grief but remade by it—no longer running from the chasm within her.
  She sheathed her blade and turned toward the path back, ready to tell the others
  what it cost and what she had found.'
