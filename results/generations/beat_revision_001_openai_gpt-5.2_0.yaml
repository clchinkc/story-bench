output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. Its voice seemed to crawl under
  her armor and into her skull. "Stronger warriors have tried. They charged the way
  you’re about to—full of righteous grief. How many did you bury? How many buried
  because you were too late?"


  The chasm wind snapped cold against her face, and with it came her brother’s last
  look—more surprise than pain, as if he’d expected her to be there. The memory didn’t
  harden her. It hollowed her.


  Kira raised her sword and charged anyway, as if speed could outrun that moment.


  The battle was brutal. Flame scorched her armor. Claws raked across her shield.
  The first time she went down, her cheek slammed stone, and the dragon’s shadow swallowed
  her whole. In it she saw her brother again, not as motivation but as accusation,
  his blood on her hands no matter how she scrubbed.


  She forced herself up.


  The second time she was knocked down, her sword skittered toward the chasm’s edge,
  and for a heartbeat she reached for it like a drowning girl reaching for air—only
  to freeze as the dragon hissed, low and intimate, “Say his name. Admit you failed
  him.”


  Her chest tightened. The world narrowed to the gap of black space beside her, an
  easy end.


  She rose again, slower, shaking harder.


  The third blow drove her to her knees. Her arms burned with exhaustion. Blood ran
  from a gash on her forehead, warm as the day she had held her brother and promised
  he wouldn’t be alone. This time, when the dragon’s shadow fell over her, she didn’t
  fight the memory. She let it hit, full force—his death, her absence, her guilt—and
  something in her finally broke loose.


  “I couldn’t save you,” she whispered, voice raw. “But I’m here now.”


  The dragon lunged, sensing surrender. And that was its mistake.


  When it overextended on a strike, Kira’s fear didn’t vanish; it steadied, stripped
  of excuses. With the last of her strength, she drove her sword through the gap in
  its scales, piercing its heart.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  victorious but exhausted, not triumphant so much as newly quiet inside.


  "I did it," she whispered. "I actually did it."


  She retrieved her sword and began the long walk back to camp, carrying her brother’s
  name without flinching.'
