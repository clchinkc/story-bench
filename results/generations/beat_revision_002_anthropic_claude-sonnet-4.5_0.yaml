output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  "There isn''t." Marcus slumped into his chair. "The fundraiser brought in half what
  we needed. The grant was denied yesterday. The board voted to dissolve this morning—they''re
  done fighting."


  Denise was quiet for a long moment. "Marcus, I got a job offer. Teaching position
  across town. I was waiting to tell you until after... but there''s no ''after''
  now, is there?"


  "No." He rubbed his temples. "You should take it."


  "I already did. I''m sorry." She picked up her bag. "I really am."


  The door closed behind her. Marcus sat alone in the empty office, listening to the
  kids'' voices echo from the gym above—their last week of basketball practice before
  everything ended.


  His phone buzzed. A text from his wife: "Attorney sent the divorce papers. Sorry
  to do this now, but you''ve been married to this place for years, not me. I can''t
  wait anymore."


  Marcus''s hands went numb. He looked around the office—photographs of fifteen graduating
  classes, trophies from tournaments, thank-you letters from parents. All of it ending.
  All of it gone.


  The door opened. DeShawn, one of his seniors, stood in the doorway. "Coach, my mom
  wanted me to thank you. I got the scholarship letter today. Full ride to State."
  The kid''s smile faded. "We heard about the eviction. This place saved my life,
  Coach. What are all those kids gonna do now?"


  Marcus opened his mouth, but nothing came out. No answer. No plan. No hope to offer.


  "Yeah," DeShawn said quietly. "That''s what I thought."


  When the door closed again, Marcus let the eviction notice fall from his hands.
  Thirty days. And then thirty years of second chances would disappear like they''d
  never existed at all.'
