output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands.

  The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes, exactly
  as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled, its voice seeping into her mind
  like freezing water. "You let him die. You stood there while your brother burned,
  and you did nothing."


  Kira’s breath hitched. The guilt she had buried for months erupted, paralyzing her.
  She charged blindly, swinging not at a monster, but at her own failure. The battle
  was a chaotic blur of fire and shadow. Three times she was knocked down, and three
  times she rose again, but not with strength. She rose because she had nowhere else
  to run, driven by a frantic need to prove the dragon wrong.


  On the third fall, the dragon’s heavy claws pinned her chest. Smoke filled her lungs,
  and the heat was unbearable. This was the moment of death—not just of her body,
  but of her spirit. The crushing weight of her unworthiness bore down on her. She
  was going to die here, a failure, just as she deserved.


  *No.*


  In the darkness of that despair, a tiny spark ignited. She realized that fighting
  for revenge was a poison. She hadn''t survived to save him; she had survived to
  finish what he started. Acceptance washed over her, cold and cleansing. The fear
  died, leaving only clarity.


  When the dragon lunged for the kill, she didn''t flinch. She saw the opening not
  with her eyes, but with her renewed spirit. With the last of her strength, she drove
  her sword through the gap in its scales, piercing its heart.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  trembling not from exhaustion, but from the shedding of her old self. The girl who
  sought redemption was gone; a warrior who understood sacrifice remained.


  "I am free," she whispered. She retrieved her sword and began the long walk back,
  no longer seeking validation, but carrying peace.'
