output: "Zoe Chen’s comfort zone was the hushed labyrinth of the Millbrook Public\
  \ Library. At seventeen, she preferred the company of dust-jacketed spines to people,\
  \ their stories offering escape from her own. Shelving books, she could vanish.\
  \ Her mother fretted about this—“You can’t live in other people’s lives forever”—but\
  \ Zoe didn’t mind. She liked the quiet, the way it muffled her stutters and half-formed\
  \ thoughts.  \n\nWhat she needed, though she wouldn’t admit it, was a voice of her\
  \ own.  \n\nWhen Ms. Okafor arrived, crisp in linen suits and purpose, the library\
  \ trembled. “Oral history,” she declared, launching a summer program to record the\
  \ oldest residents’ stories. “Who’s in?” Hands shot up. Zoe’s stayed rooted to her\
  \ lap. The idea of prying into strangers’ lives—of being seen—made her pulse thrash.\
  \ But Ms. Okafor cornered her later, holding out a recorder like a peace offering.\
  \ “You *get* stories, Zoe. Try one interview. That’s all.” Her mother’s disapproval\
  \ hummed in Zoe’s ears (“Volunteering doesn’t pay bills”), but she took the device\
  \ anyway.  \n\nThe first interview was Bernard Park, a 89-year-old Korean War veteran\
  \ who smelled of mothballs and peppermint. Zoe clutched her index cards like lifelines\
  \ as he stared out the window, voice raspy. “You’re here for the war, right?” he\
  \ asked. She nodded, ready to flee. “Then you’ll want the truth, not the medals,”\
  \ he said. She hesitated. Then, quietly, she pressed record.  \n\nThe search was\
  \ a gauntlet. Her first interviews were stilted. Elders squinted at her scripted\
  \ questions; her voice cracked mid-sentence. But Bernard kept talking, unspooling\
  \ tales of foxholes and frostbite, and something in her shifted. She learned to\
  \ lean in. To wait. Listening, she realized, could be a kind of bravery. By the\
  \ fifth interview, her hands steadied. Ms. Okafor smiled; her mother scoffed (“This\
  \ won’t teach you accounting”). But Bernard—gruff, grinning—told her, “You’ve got\
  \ the patience of a priest.”  \n\nThe find came on a rainy August afternoon. Bernard\
  \ leaned forward, voice trembling. “There’s something I’ve never told anyone,” he\
  \ murmured. He spoke of a friend left behind in a firefight, a guilt that had clung\
  \ for seventy years. “You asked the right questions,” he said. “Will you tell this?”\
  \ The request lodged in her throat. She agreed, but only if she could share it publicly.\
  \  \n\nThe town hall was packed by the final night. One hundred faces blurred under\
  \ fluorescent lights. Zoe’s palms slickened on the podium. Then she saw Bernard,\
  \ nodding, and remembered his words: *“You’ve got the patience of a priest.”* She\
  \ spoke. Her voice wavered, then steadied. When she finished, the room stood. But\
  \ Bernard’s watery smile mattered more. “You heard me,” he whispered, gripping her\
  \ hand.  \n\nWhen the program ended, others quit. Zoe kept visiting Bernard, recording\
  \ until October’s chill stole his breath. At his funeral, his family asked her to\
  \ speak. This time, she didn’t script it. She told how he’d taught her that listening\
  \ was a bridge, not an escape.  \n\nSenior year, she applied to journalism schools.\
  \ Her essay chronicled the old voices who’d shaped her, the boy who’d shown her\
  \ courage lived in questions, not answers. She still rehearsed her coffee orders.\
  \ But she’d learned to walk into the unknown, recorder in hand, ready to hear. \
  \ \n\nThe quiet girl who’d hidden in shelves now filled rooms with other people’s\
  \ truths. And her own."
