output: "Dr. Samira Hassan’s reputation as a virologist was built on precision—until\
  \ the screen in front of her displayed a protein structure that mocked every equation\
  \ she’d ever trusted. The virus from Patient Zero defied taxonomy, its genetic code\
  \ a chimera of sequences that should never have coexisted. She’d triple-checked\
  \ the sequencing software before Raj interrupted, his face taut with urgency. “The\
  \ CDC wants to know why we requested a containment team.” She hesitated, the weight\
  \ of her career pressing against the truth: if she was wrong, she’d be dismissed\
  \ as a fraud. If she was right, the world was already at risk. “Tell them Level\
  \ 4,” she said quietly.  \n\nThe hospital became a fortress overnight. Within 72\
  \ hours, the quarantine protocols sealed both staff and patients inside, while more\
  \ cases streamed in—each displaying the same inexplicable symptoms. Samira worked\
  \ in a fugue of caffeine and dread, her lab walls plastered with genome maps that\
  \ refused to align. At hour sixty, Raj found her slumped over a terminal, her hands\
  \ trembling. “It’s adapting,” she muttered, staring at the failed PCR results. “Not\
  \ randomly. Strategically.” The phrase echoed in her skull as she reopened Patient\
  \ Zero’s file: a warehouse manager with no travel history, employed by Nexus Biotech.\
  \ The name prickled her memory—patents, mergers, a shadowy spurt of acquisitions\
  \ in gene-editing startups. When the link solidified, her breath hitched. “It’s\
  \ not natural,” she whispered. “It’s *designed*.”  \n\nTwelve hours before the quarantine\
  \ collapsed, Samira stood in Nexus’s glass-walled conference room, her thumb drive\
  \ gripped like a weapon. The executives smiled, polished and reptilian, as their\
  \ counsel recited liabilities. “You’ll be sued for defamation. The CDC will revoke\
  \ your license.” She let the threats hang, then slid the drive across the table.\
  \ “The cure’s formula is already queued to publish globally if I don’t input a code\
  \ within six hours. Your choice.” The room erupted in panicked calls, but Samira\
  \ walked out, her pulse roaring.  \n\nThe press conference was a storm of flashing\
  \ bulbs and shouted questions. Nexus’s PR director hissed warnings from the podium,\
  \ but Samira raised her voice. “This virus was engineered. These people knew.” She\
  \ unveiled the genome edits, the patent trails, the company’s acquisition of a defunct\
  \ bioweapons lab. When the CEO lunged to her microphone, she released the final\
  \ slide: the cure’s molecular blueprint, freely accessible. “You can’t bury this,”\
  \ she said, meeting the cameras. “You can’t own it.”  \n\nSix weeks later, the outbreak\
  \ smoldered into containment. Nexus faced congressional subpoenas, its executives\
  \ trading accusations like bait. Samira’s inbox overflowed with job offers—from\
  \ nonprofits, universities, even a tech billionaire’s moonshot lab. She deleted\
  \ them all. Instead, she taught free clinics in underserved towns, her name a footnote\
  \ in journals, her vindication quiet and absolute. When Raj visited one evening,\
  \ he found her dissecting a sample under a donated microscope. “Regrets?” he asked.\
  \ She shook her head. “It was never about the credit,” she said, and meant it. The\
  \ world had seen the truth. That, and nothing else, was enough."
