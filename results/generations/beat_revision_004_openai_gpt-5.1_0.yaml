output: 'Detective Rachel Torres balanced a chipped mug of black coffee on a stack
  of worn case files, the steam curling into the dim light of her Queens apartment.
  A saxophone murmured from the radio on the counter, brushed drums keeping time with
  the rattle of the elevated train outside.


  Her cat named Sherlock sprawled across a manila folder, batting lazily at her badge
  where it hung from a chair. The lanyard still carried a faint crease from an old
  evidence tag. Once, in a fourth-floor walk-up stinking of bleach and fear, that
  same kitten had meowed from under a blood-speckled couch, eyes too big for its head.
  Now he flicked his tail over an unsolved file and refused to move.


  “Accessory after the fact,” Rachel muttered, sliding the folder out from under him
  anyway. The clock on the stove blinked 2:17 a.m., never reset from some long-ago
  outage; she hadn’t been home early enough to care. The cold case photos inside were
  already memorized, faces and alleys etched into the back of her mind.


  On the fridge, a sun-faded photo showed her father in a detective’s suit, tie crooked,
  arm slung around a younger Rachel in an academy sweatshirt. Her phone buzzed with
  his name and a text about a fishing trip he kept trying to drag her on. She let
  it go dark and grabbed her coat.


  The Riverside Precinct hummed as she walked in, fluorescent lights buzzing over
  a lobby where a man in a tailored suit argued quietly beside a woman in a janitor’s
  uniform. Upstairs, the board in Major Crimes was crowded with pins—Burglary, Upper
  Riverside; Auto Theft, Old Dock Blocks.


  “Morning, Torres.” A fresh-faced officer stepped aside. “Got another break-in. They
  want your take.”


  Detective James Oyelaran appeared at her elbow, setting a coffee—black—on her desk
  without asking. “Third year running, they still send us the fun ones.”


  She slid a cold case file aside to make room, and he noticed, but didn’t comment.


  It was a Tuesday morning in October when everything changed.'
