output: 'Zoe Chen preferred the dust-mote silence of the Millbrook Public Library
  to the cacophony of the real world. At seventeen, she was an expert at disappearing.
  Shelving books was a precise form of camouflage; she could slip between the Dewey
  Decimal numbers and exist only as a pair of hands organizing other people’s thoughts.
  But safety has a way of becoming a cage. While she told herself she was content
  living vicariously through fiction, a hollow space was growing in her chest—a need
  to be part of the living world, even if the thought made her pulse hammer against
  her throat. She needed to be seen, even if she was terrified to look up.


  That need found a shape when Ms. Okafor, the new librarian, placed a digital recorder
  on the circulation desk. "Oral history project," she said, her gaze too direct for
  Zoe’s comfort. "Millbrook’s elders are forgetting. I need you to help them remember."
  Zoe wanted to refuse, to retreat to the biography section, but Ms. Okafor had seen
  her reading Studs Terkel. She saw the hunger beneath the fear. Zoe took the recorder.
  It felt heavy, like a weapon or a key. Walking to Bernard Park’s house for her first
  interview, Zoe felt she was stepping off a cliff, leaving the sanctuary of the stacks
  for the messy, unscripted world of a stranger’s living room.


  The first sessions were excruciating. Zoe clung to her index cards, her voice a
  thin reed that barely registered on the recording. Bernard, eighty-nine and weathered
  like old driftwood, sat in his armchair, waiting. There were long, jagged silences.
  Her mother had scoffed at the project, urging Zoe to find a "real job" at the mall,
  adding to the pressure. But Zoe kept going back. She navigated the awkwardness,
  the smell of old paper and peppermint, and the terrifying expanse of conversation.
  She learned to put the cards down. She learned that the hum of the recorder could
  create a sacred circle where time suspended. She stopped trying to fill the silence
  and started inhabiting it.


  The breakthrough happened in late July. The humidity pressed against the windows,
  and Bernard began to speak of Korea—not the dates and maps, but the mud, the cold,
  and the specific weight of guilt he had carried for sixty years. "You’re the first
  one who just sat still enough to hear it," he whispered. Zoe realized then that
  her quietness wasn''t a flaw; it was a superpower. She had found something vital:
  listening was an act of aggressive empathy. She wasn''t just recording data; she
  was bearing witness.


  But finding the story wasn''t enough; she had to carry it. The Town Hall presentation
  was the price she had to pay for the truth she had unearthed. Standing before a
  hundred people, Zoe’s hands shook so violently the papers rattled against the microphone
  stand. She looked at Bernard in the front row. He nodded, a small, sharp gesture
  of permission. Zoe took a breath, bypassing her terror, and began to speak. She
  didn''t just play the recording; she narrated the spaces between his words. She
  gave his truth to the room, and in doing so, she took ownership of her own voice.


  The applause washed over her, but the summer faded. The program ended, the volunteers
  scattered, and the library returned to its dusty quiet. Yet, Zoe couldn''t fit back
  into her old camouflage. The silence of the stacks felt different now—not like a
  hiding place, but like a pause before speaking. When Bernard died in October, the
  grief was sharp and real, a cost of connection she accepted willingly.


  At the funeral, Zoe stood at the lectern. She didn''t need index cards. She looked
  at the mourners and spoke not just of Bernard’s history, but of what he had taught
  her: that stories are the threads that stitch us together. Later that year, she
  applied to journalism programs. Her personal essay was about the forgotten voices
  of Millbrook. She still rehearsed her order before buying coffee, her heart still
  raced, but she knew now that she could stand in front of the world and make it listen.'
