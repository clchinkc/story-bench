output: "Maya’s hands found comfort in the rhythm of clay, shaping bowls and cups\
  \ for the villagers who smiled at her quiet skill. Her grandmother’s ghost lingered\
  \ in the walls of her workshop, where dust-coated shelves held forgotten ceremonial\
  \ vessels like silent judges. The spring had always flowed, until it didn’t. Elders\
  \ spoke of old rituals requiring a potter’s soul, not just their hands. But Maya’s\
  \ soul felt too small for such weight.  \n\nShe packed at dawn, her satchel heavy\
  \ with doubts. The mountain path twisted upward, unfamiliar and sharp. Each step\
  \ echoed her grandmother’s name, a woman who’d walked these trails decades before.\
  \ At dusk, Maya hesitated at the forest’s edge, hearing whispers in the wind. *You\
  \ aren’t ready*, they hissed. Her fingers brushed the pottery shards buried in her\
  \ bag—fragments of failed attempts, proof of her inadequacy.  \n\nThe shrine’s ruins\
  \ swallowed her by noon on the second day. Vines strangled stone pillars, and time\
  \ had crumbled murals into riddles. She might have turned back, if not for the journal—tucked\
  \ beneath a collapsed beam, leather cracked but ink still bold. *“The clay speaks,”*\
  \ her grandmother had written. *“Listen. Do not shape.”* The words hummed in Maya’s\
  \ chest. She lit a fire, feeding it driftwood and resolve.  \n\nCrossing into the\
  \ shrine’s heart, she became a stranger to herself. The journal’s sketches guided\
  \ her hands, but the text demanded surrender. For three days, she fasted, watching\
  \ flames dance. On the fourth night, she kneaded clay until her wrists ached, then\
  \ stilled. The vessel rose not from her will, but her stillness—a spiral-necked\
  \ jar ribbed like river currents, unlike any pot before it.  \n\nDawn found her\
  \ trembling beside the kiln. The journal’s final page fluttered in her mind: *“Your\
  \ hands are not the sculptor.”* She had carved no lines. The clay had remembered\
  \ itself. Descending the mountain, the jar cradled in burlap, she stumbled. The\
  \ path blurred. Twice, she almost left it on mossy stones, a weight too sacred to\
  \ carry. *Who are you to restore what was lost?* the doubts snarled. But the journal’s\
  \ voice answered louder: *“You are the song, not the singer.”*  \n\nVillagers gathered\
  \ at the spring’s parched bed as Maya arrived. Their eyes asked the same question:\
  \ *How dare you?* She placed the jar at the dry basin’s center, water jug poised.\
  \ Memories surged—her grandmother’s laughter, her own years of safe, simple bowls,\
  \ the fire that taught her to listen. She poured seawater into the vessel, salt\
  \ and hope mingling.  \n\nNothing.  \n\nThen—a gurgle. A thread of water seeped\
  \ from the jar’s lip, then a rush. The crowd’s cheers swelled, but Maya heard only\
  \ the spring’s awakening song. Not magic. Not her grandmother’s ghost. A truth older\
  \ than both: the spring returned because she’d stopped trying to deserve it.  \n\
  \nShe walked home cradling the empty jar, its purpose spent. Her workshop awaited,\
  \ kiln cold. But tomorrow, she would open the shutters, and the villagers would\
  \ come—not for bowls, but for vessels to hold what only surrender could birth."
