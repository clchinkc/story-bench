output: 'The blogger''s snarky post backfired spectacularly. Within forty-eight hours,
  comments flooded in defending the underdog pink bus, and someone dug up Priya''s
  grandmother''s photo from the truck''s Instagram—a tiny woman in a salwar kameez
  standing next to a massive smoker, grinning like she''d conquered Texas herself.


  "Fusion Queen Grandma" started trending locally.


  By Saturday morning, the line stretched around the block.


  "I need more brisket," Priya shouted over the sizzle of the griddle, sweat dripping
  down her temple. "And the raita''s running low."


  "On it." Dev squeezed past her in the cramped kitchen, their movements synchronized
  after three frantic days of trial by fire. He''d stopped complaining about the chaos
  somewhere around customer fifty. Now he moved like he''d been born folding samosa
  pockets and pulling smoked meat.


  They''d developed a rhythm: Priya handled the fusion magic, layering her grandmother''s
  spice blends onto Texas-style proteins, while Dev worked the window, charming customers
  and managing the increasingly insane wait times. When the ticket printer jammed
  at the worst possible moment, he fixed it with a bobby pin and sheer determination
  while Priya covered both stations.


  "You know," he said during a rare thirty-second lull, "when you pitched me this
  idea over terrible margaritas, I thought you''d lost your mind."


  "And now?"


  He handed her a cold water bottle without her asking. "Now I think we might actually
  pull this off."


  Priya felt something warm settle in her chest—not romance, but something maybe more
  valuable. Trust. Partnership. The knowledge that she''d picked the right person
  to be terrified alongside.


  The afternoon brought a visitor. A gleaming black truck rolled up across the street,
  chrome fixtures catching the sun. The side read "Spice Route" in elegant gold lettering,
  and the man who stepped out wore a chef''s coat that probably cost more than Priya''s
  monthly rent.


  Marcus Chen. She recognized him from Austin Monthly''s "Chefs to Watch" issue. His
  fusion concept had won the Food Truck Championship two years running.


  He bought a taco, ate it slowly, and nodded once before driving away without a word.


  "Was that—" Dev started.


  "Yeah."


  "Should we be worried?"


  Before Priya could answer, her phone buzzed. Then again. Then continuously for thirty
  seconds straight.


  The Championship Committee had posted the preliminary brackets. Priya''s heart sank
  and soared simultaneously as she read the announcement: due to unprecedented public
  interest, this year''s competition would be live-streamed, judged by a celebrity
  panel, and sponsored by a major network.


  The prize had quadrupled.


  And right there in the bracket, their first-round opponent: Spice Route.


  "We''re competing against Marcus Chen," Dev said slowly. "On television. In front
  of millions of people."


  Priya stared at their pink bus, at the hand-painted menu still showing prices she''d
  calculated on napkins, at the grandmother photo taped crookedly by the window. What
  had been a local competition to save their struggling business had become something
  exponentially bigger.


  They were succeeding beyond their wildest dreams. And that success had just painted
  a massive target on their backs.


  "We''re going to need more paneer," she finally said.


  Dev laughed, but it sounded nervous. Neither of them mentioned the real problem
  they''d been avoiding—the health inspection scheduled for the day before the competition,
  the one Priya had been quietly panicking about ever since she''d noticed the truck''s
  ventilation system wasn''t quite up to code.


  One crisis at a time.'
