output: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands. Thirty days to vacate
  the community center where he''d run his youth program for fifteen years. The property
  developer had won. The city council had sold out.


  "There has to be something we can do," said Denise, his assistant director.


  Marcus slumped into his chair. He rubbed his temples, his fingers digging into his
  scalp. "The grant application—the one that could''ve covered our operating budget
  for two years. You were supposed to submit it last month."


  Denise''s face went white. She stepped back like he''d struck her. "I didn''t file
  it. The paperwork got buried on my desk under... under everything. I only found
  it yesterday." Her voice cracked. "It''s too late. The deadline''s passed." She
  hugged herself, looking small in the doorway. "And... I can''t stay until the end
  of the month. I got another job. I start next week. I was going to tell you, but—"


  His phone buzzed. A text from his wife: "We need to talk. The kids are asking why
  you''re never home. They need their father."


  Marcus stared at the screen, then at the eviction notice, then at Denise—who wouldn''t
  meet his eyes. The fundraiser in three weeks was pointless now. The board had already
  pulled their support. The new location would cost triple what they had, and he had
  nothing. Not even his assistant. Not even a future.


  The center would be gone. The kids would be scattered. His marriage was crumbling.
  And he had nothing left to fight with.


  He couldn''t breathe. Couldn''t move. Couldn''t see a way forward that didn''t end
  in ruin. '
