output: 'Zoe Chen spent her summers in the Millbrook Public Library because it was
  quiet and predictable. At seventeen, she knew exactly where every book lived, which
  windows caught the afternoon light, and how to shelve volumes so no one would notice
  her there. She disappeared into other people''s stories because living her own felt
  too loud, too exposed.


  What Zoe didn''t know was that stories had a way of finding her anyway.


  The new librarian, Ms. Okafor, announced the oral history program in late June.
  "Millbrook''s oldest residents have stories worth preserving," she said. "I need
  volunteers." Zoe''s hand stayed glued to her lap. Talking to strangers. Recording
  their voices. She couldn''t even order coffee without rehearsing the words.


  But Ms. Okafor found her hiding in the stacks that afternoon. "I saw you reading
  Terkel''s ''Working'' last week." She sat beside Zoe on the worn carpet. "You understand
  why stories matter. That''s rarer than you think." She placed a recorder in Zoe''s
  hands. "Just one interview. Try."


  The first was Bernard Park, eighty-nine, a Korean War veteran who''d lived in Millbrook
  for sixty years. Zoe showed up with questions written on index cards, her voice
  shaking. The interview lasted eleven minutes. She forgot half her questions.


  The second was worse. The third, awkward. But somewhere around the fifth, something
  shifted. The old voices began to trust her. She learned that listening was its own
  kind of courage—that leaning in, truly hearing someone, required a bravery she hadn''t
  known she lacked.


  Bernard became her anchor. He''d lived through things he''d never told anyone, he
  confessed one afternoon. "You''re the first person who ever asked the right questions."
  He wanted to share his story—but only if she''d tell it publicly. The town hall
  presentation would be in three weeks.


  Zoe, who couldn''t order coffee without rehearsing, stood at a microphone before
  a hundred people. She gave voice to Bernard''s survival, his guilt, his grace. When
  she finished, the room stood. Bernard''s handshake was firm, his eyes wet. "You
  heard me," he said. "That''s all any of us want."


  The summer ended. The program concluded. Other volunteers drifted away. But Zoe
  kept visiting Bernard, kept recording, kept asking.


  When he passed in October, his family asked her to speak at the funeral. This time,
  she wasn''t giving voice to someone else''s story. She was sharing her own: what
  Bernard had taught her about listening, about courage, about the stories that connect
  us all.


  By December, Zoe applied to journalism programs. Her essay was about Millbrook''s
  forgotten voices—the ones she''d been too afraid to hear until she wasn''t. She
  still couldn''t order coffee without rehearsing. But she could stand in front of
  a hundred strangers and make them listen.


  Some stories are borrowed. Some are built from silence. Zoe had spent her life hiding
  in the spaces between words. Now she understood that every story worth telling begins
  with the willingness to hear.'
