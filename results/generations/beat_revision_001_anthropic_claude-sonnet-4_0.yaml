output: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm, her sword heavy in her trembling
  hands. The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,
  exactly as the prophecies had described.


  "You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled. "You couldn''t even save your
  brother. What makes you think you can save anyone else?"


  The words hit harder than any claw could. Kira''s sword wavered as the familiar
  guilt crashed over her—watching helplessly as the plague took him, her healing magic
  useless, her promises empty.


  "He called your name as he died," the dragon continued, its voice slithering through
  her mind. "He believed in you. And you failed him."


  Kira charged, desperate to silence the voice, but her attacks were wild, unfocused.
  The dragon''s flame scorched her armor. Claws raked across her shield. She was knocked
  down, then again, each fall harder than the last.


  On the third fall, she didn''t get up. She lay there, broken, as the dragon''s laughter
  filled the chasm.


  "This is who you really are," it whispered. "Not a hero. A failure."


  In that moment of absolute darkness, Kira stopped fighting the truth. Yes, she had
  failed her brother. Yes, she would fail again. But that didn''t mean she should
  stop trying.


  She rose, not with desperate fury but with quiet acceptance. Her sword moved differently
  now—not to prove something, but simply to act when action was needed.


  When the dragon overextended on a strike, she saw her opening. With calm precision,
  she drove her sword through the gap in its scales, piercing its heart.


  The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body,
  no longer the same person who had entered this place.


  "I understand now," she whispered.


  She retrieved her sword and began the long walk back to camp, carrying not good
  news, but wisdom.'
