output: 'Jazz crackled from the kitchen radio while Detective Rachel Torres traced
  a fingertip along a grainy printout, halting where a fire escape’s shadow ran too
  short for the streetlamp it supposedly fell under. She circled the mismatch and
  sipped black coffee gone lukewarm.


  On the table, a cat named Sherlock rose from a flattened banker’s box marked in
  her handwriting: Cold—Photocopies. He nudged a bent plastic tent that once read
  2, batting it off the edge with a decisive thwap. “Helpful,” she said, rescuing
  the page before it went with the marker.


  A sun-faded photo hung by the door: Rachel in dress blues beside a man with the
  same set jaw, an old shield mounted beneath the frame. She palmed her badge case—cracked
  leather, edges burnished smooth—and shrugged on her coat.


  Riverside Precinct hummed awake. A woman in sleek gym wear complained about a vanished
  package while a contractor with drywall on his sleeves waited, cap twisting in his
  hands. The crime board on the far wall wore a rash of red dots inching east along
  Riverside Drive. Phones trilled. Fluorescents buzzed.


  “Black,” Detective James Oyelaran said, sliding a steaming cup into her palm without
  looking up from the board. “You were going to forget.”


  Rachel lifted her eyes to the cluster near Riverpark. “Your dots are creeping.”


  “Economy’s squeezing,” he said, then tapped her file where she’d circled. “Shadow’s
  off. Ladder’s been moved.”


  She smirked. “Stop reading over my shoulder.”


  “Your handwriting is a cry for help.” He capped a marker and handed it to her butt-end
  first. She took it without glancing, already jotting the cross-street he’d anticipated.


  “How’s the warehouse stray?” James asked.


  “Promoted. He sorts by napping on the file I need.”


  “Smart cat.”


  “Chooses better company than we do,” she said, easing the folder into a drawer she’d
  promised herself not to keep opening.


  It was a Tuesday morning in October when everything changed.'
