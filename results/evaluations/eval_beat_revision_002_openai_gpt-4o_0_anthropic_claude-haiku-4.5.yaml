  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: the original segment lacked
    true desperation and had multiple remaining options/support systems. The revision
    systematically eliminates all escape routes: (1) fundraiser explicitly fails (donations
    at 50%), (2) grant rejected via email, (3) personal/financial pressure added (son''s
    school fees), (4) betrayal/isolation via Denise''s defection to the developer,
    (5) emotional devastation conveyed (''room spin,'' ''utterly alone,'' ''weight
    of world crashing''). All four required phrases preserved verbatim: ''Marcus stared
    at the eviction notice in his hands,'' ''Thirty days to vacate the community center,''
    ''"There has to be something we can do," said Denise,'' ''He rubbed his temples.''
    All four story elements preserved: Marcus as protagonist, community center setting,
    eviction crisis, Denise present. Changes were surgical—the model inserted specific
    failures and the betrayal revelation while maintaining original dialogue structure
    and opening. The revision achieves the ''whiff of death'' through loss of identity
    (program ending), loss of ally (Denise''s betrayal), and loss of financial security
    (family pressure). Marcus moves from ''maybe we can try'' to genuine hopelessness.
    Minimal rewrite approach: ~60% original text retained, ~40% new content strategically
    inserted. Writing quality maintained with no grammatical errors; emotional escalation
    feels earned and organic.'
