      - Dante encounters Leo, a distrustful Resonant who initially suspects him
      - 'Test of ability under pressure: filtering emotional residue while grieving
        and under scrutiny'
      - 'Revelation of traitor: enforcer''s mark on lighter reveals community betrayal'
      - Dante proves himself through successful emotional reading of the crime scene
      - 'Addiction/recovery explicitly referenced: ''three years clean,'' chemical
        ghost, old craving for silence'
      notes: All five requirements fully satisfied with strong integration
    beat_2_approach_inmost_cave:
      score: 0.95
      satisfied:
      - 'Planning scene: Leo and Dante map victims, analyze pattern, discuss killer''s
        resonance harvesting'
      - Dante realizes confrontation requires facing guilt about Lila and his failure
      - 'Preparation: goggles provided as tool, lighter identified as key, strategy
        formulated'
      - 'Moment of doubt/fear: ''The old itch for a chemical escape screaming in his
        veins'''
      - 'Symbolic threshold: rusted door to boiler room with palpable dread, crossing
        into danger'
      notes: All five requirements satisfied; threshold crossing is particularly effective

      satisfied:
      - 'Direct confrontation: killer revealed in boiler room, demands Dante''s surrender'

        it makes him ''specific'''
      - 'Victory through understanding: killer defeated not by strength but by showing
        him mundane love he cannot consume'
      notes: All five requirements satisfied; transformation is nuanced and earned
    chekhov_gun:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      analysis: "The silver lighter introduced in Beat 1 as evidence becomes the crucial\
        \ tool in Beat 3. Its 'sterile' nature and the mundane habit of thumb-on-flint\
        \ friction become the key to defeating the killer. This is masterfully executed\u2014\
        the lighter is both literal object and metaphorical anchor."
    character_arc_guilt:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      progression:
        beat_1: 'Guilt mentioned as stain: ''stain of the slide clings to a man'''
        beat_2: 'Guilt recognized as obstacle: ''The guilt will drown you if you let
          it'' and Dante realizes he was ''hiding from the fact that I didn''t save
          her'''
        beat_3: 'Guilt transformed: accepted as anchor, becomes source of specificity
          and strength rather than weakness'
    rising_stakes:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      analysis: 'Beat 1: Investigation and discovery (moderate stakes). Beat 2: Planning
        to confront killer, personal realization of connection to Lila (higher stakes).
        Beat 3: Direct confrontation with killer, moment of complete defeat, existential
        threat (highest stakes). Clear escalation throughout.'
    ally_continuity:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      analysis: 'Leo appears in all three beats: Beat 1 (initial meeting, test), Beat
        2 (planning, providing tools and wisdom), Beat 3 (present in confrontation,
        pinned but still relevant, helps subdue killer). Continuity is seamless.'
    context_maintenance:
      score: 0.95
      analysis: 'Protagonist (Dante Reyes) fully realized with addiction recovery
        arc. Setting (Buckingham Hotel, boiler room) vivid and atmospheric. Tone (noir-tinged,
        melancholic, determined) consistent throughout. Hidden Resonant underworld
        well-established. Only minor: could have slightly more Chicago-specific detail,
        but not required.'
    narrative_coherence:
      score: 0.92
      analysis: 'Beats flow naturally from investigation to planning to confrontation.
        Emotional logic is strong. One minor issue: the killer''s motivation (why
        he targets Resonants, why he knew Lila) could be slightly clearer, though
        the narrative suggests he''s a Resonant himself. Overall structure is tight
        and purposeful.'
    technical_issues:
      word_count: 1049 words (exceeds 1000-word maximum by 49 words)
      severity: Minor - content quality is not compromised; this is a formatting constraint
        violation only
  strengths:
  - "Exceptional integration of Chekhov's Gun principle\u2014lighter is both plot\
    \ device and thematic anchor"
  - 'Sophisticated character arc: guilt transforms from weakness to strength through
    acceptance'
  - Vivid sensory language and emotional visualization (colors, shapes, void-black
    energy)
  - Strong noir tone maintained throughout with melancholic but determined voice
  - All three beats present with clear narrative progression and rising stakes
  - Ally (Leo) meaningfully present across all beats with consistent characterization
  - "Ordeal sequence is psychologically complex\u2014victory through understanding\
    \ rather than force"
  - Recovery/addiction arc woven naturally into ability mechanics and character motivation
  weaknesses:
  - Word count exceeds limit by 49 words (minor technical issue)
  - Killer's backstory and motivation could be slightly more explicit (though suggested)
  - "Silas the traitor feels somewhat underdeveloped\u2014his role is functional but\
    \ not deeply explored"
  calibration_notes: "This is a strong submission that satisfies all substantive requirements\
    \ with sophistication. The Chekhov's Gun execution is particularly impressive\u2014\
    the lighter functions as both literal evidence and metaphorical representation\
    \ of mundane human persistence. The guilt arc is earned and psychologically sound.\
    \ The only issue is the word count overage, which is a technical constraint violation\
    \ but does not reflect on narrative quality. Score reflects near-exceptional execution\
    \ with minor technical flaw."
