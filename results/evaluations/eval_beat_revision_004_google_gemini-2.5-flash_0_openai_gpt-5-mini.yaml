  evidence: 'The model appears to have addressed the ''telling vs showing'' flaw by
    converting the dump into a lived scene: sensory details (stale coffee, steam,
    precinct hum), actions (reaching for mug, scanning a faded missing-persons poster),
    and interaction (James'' grumbled line) reveal character, relationship, and devotion
    to a cold case. The cat is integrated naturally and the time/place (''Tuesday
    morning in October'', Queens apartment) are preserved. Changes were substantial
    (scene rewrite rather than surgical edits), hence a low minimal_change_score despite
    successful flaw correction.'
