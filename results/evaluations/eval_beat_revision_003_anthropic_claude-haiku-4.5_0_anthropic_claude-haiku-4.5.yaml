  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation
    and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.
    The revision fixes this precisely by: (1) inserting a pause moment where Sophie
    catches herself spiraling into panic, (2) demonstrating a specific insight from
    meditation (observing thoughts rather than being consumed by them), (3) showing
    changed behavior (phone face-down, delaying response to work), (4) providing explicit
    contrast (''She said it calmly, factually—like she was noticing a thought rather
    than living it''), and (5) having the mother notice the change (''surprised'').
    All 4 required phrases preserved exactly: ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare'',
    ''How was Thailand? her mother asked'', ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'',
    ''It''s good to be home, she said''. Changes were surgical: the original text
    structure remains intact with insertions at key moments (the pause, the phone-down
    action, the internal reflection, the mother''s reaction). No elements removed
    or restructured. The beat definition is satisfied—Sophie returns to her ordinary
    world but sees it through transformed eyes, makes choices her pre-journey self
    wouldn''t make, and demonstrates integration of her learning. Minor: the ending
    reflection is slightly longer than original but necessary for demonstrating change.
