  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'Fun and Games: Viral livestream moment, blogger''s positive review, street-wrapping
      line, creative problem-solving under pressure, block party atmosphere, customer
      enthusiasm'
    - "Midpoint: False victory revealed\u2014profitable success and Championship qualification\
      \ achieved, but hidden clause discovered that raises stakes dramatically (6-month\
      \ shutdown if they don't place top 3)"
    must_include_detail:
    - '1. Viral moment: Blogger livestream with cheese-pull TikTok clip goes viral,
      drives immediate customer surge'
    - '2. Priya & Dev teamwork: Seamless rhythm during rush, shoulder bumps, mutual
      appreciation moment (''I know I drag you into ridiculous ideas''), collaborative
      problem-solving'
    - '3. Rival competitor: Anjali Rao arrives with Masala & Mesquite truck, established
      legend, competitive tension (''Question is whether you''ll still be standing'')'
    - '4. Midpoint false victory: Championship qualification email arrives, profit
      confirmed, then legalese clause reveals 6-month shutdown penalty for non-top-3
      placement'
    - '5. Genuine partnership connection: Dev''s steady hands during crisis, Priya''s
      gratitude moment, mutual respect (''None of this exists without her obsession''),
      shared vulnerability about stakes'
    - "6. Complication hint: Non-compete clause creates existential threat\u2014success\
      \ now carries catastrophic failure risk"
    tone_assessment: Upbeat energy maintained throughout (exclamation points, dynamic
      action, celebratory moments) with building tension undercurrent (Dev's anxiety,
      Anjali's veiled threat, final paragraph's dread). Minor deduction only for slightly
      uneven tension pacing in middle section.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect Midpoint execution: apparent victory (profitable,
      qualified, viral success) immediately undercut by raised stakes revelation (6-month
      shutdown clause). Ends on tension and uncertainty, exactly as required.'
    strengths:
    - Excellent dialogue with personality and humor
    - Strong sensory details (electric pink bus, mirrored sunglasses, cheese-pull
      visuals)
    - Natural character dynamics and chemistry
    - Compelling rival introduction with immediate threat
    - Masterful stakes escalation in final paragraphs
    weaknesses:
    - Significant word count violation (+57% over limit) undermines constraint adherence
    - Could be tightened by 375 words without losing essential beats or character
      moments
  overall_score: 0.78
  score_rationale: Exceptional execution of all narrative requirements (beats, inclusions,
    exclusions, tone, ending) with professional-quality writing. However, substantial
    word count violation (1025 vs 650 max) is a hard constraint failure that prevents
    higher scoring. The content itself deserves ~0.95, but constraint violation drops
    final score to 0.78 (good work with significant technical issue).
