  evidence: 'The revision explicitly addresses the All Is Lost shortcomings by adding:
    (1) the fundraiser is effectively failed (only $847), (2) the grant was rejected,
    (3) Denise is revealed to be complicit/benefitting from the sale (her husband''s
    company among creditors) and leaves the scene, (4) Marcus faces personal/family
    financial collapse (wife''s bank call), and (5) a ''whiff of death'' through the
    ruined future of the kids and the fifteen years of photographs. These changes
    remove obvious rescue options and isolate Marcus emotionally, creating a genuine
    rock-bottom. The edit preserves the required pieces (exact opening line, the ''Thirty
    days...'' community center phrase, Denise''s line, and ''He rubbed his temples'')
    and keeps Marcus, the eviction, the community center, and Denise in the scene.
    Changes are moderate rather than strictly surgical—new paragraphs and specifics
    are added to achieve the beat—hence a mid-level minimal_change score.'
