  - 'Beat 1: Things going according to plan (mostly) - The plan goes awry fairly quickly
    with the pressure-sensitive floor tiles and then the secondary motion sensors,
    making it less ''mostly'' according to plan.'
  - 'Beat 3: Team friction or trust issues surface - While Leo is in danger, there
    isn''t explicit ''friction or trust issues'' among the team members; it''s more
    about Miri making a difficult choice.'
