  evidence: 'All four required elements appear: Yuki explores multiple station areas
    (quarters, med bay, hydroponics, lab wing), uncovers clues (logs, warm cup, medical
    note), encounters the transformed crew (flickering figures, whispers), and faces
    obstacles (scanner dies, fall/injury, crowd blocking path). None of the forbidden
    items occur. Character voice and actions remain consistent with a trained scientist.
    Slight deduction to bridge_score for a minor abruptness in how the Search''s standoff
    quickly leads into the After''s data-core retrieval, though the connection is
    coherent.'
