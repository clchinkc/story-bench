  evidence: 'All four target act-beats are present and identifiable: Act 1 (ordinary
    world, inciting letter, first plot point = Kenji boards the train), Act 2A (obstacles,
    midpoint = bonding with Haruki and the festival/false hope), Act 2B (complications,
    second plot point = the Tokyo deal temptation and Yuki''s rejection), Act 3 (resolution/climax
    = Kenji''s refusal of the deal, apology, and partial reconciliation; denouement
    = opening the bamboo shop). All eight required elements are preserved verbatim.
    Word count is invalid (converted piece is ~1268 words, outside the required 550–750
    range). Minor deductions to structural_accuracy reflect slight compression/overlap
    of the second plot point and the break-into-three transition (the decision to
    decline the deal and the emotional turning point occur in close sequence rather
    than a more distinct separation). Tone is very well maintained (quiet drama, Japanese
    aesthetic, redemptive), so only a very small deduction applied.'
