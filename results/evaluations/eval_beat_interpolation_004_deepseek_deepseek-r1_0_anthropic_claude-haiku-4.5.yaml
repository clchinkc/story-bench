  evidence: "All 4 required elements present: (1) Direct examination with specific\
    \ questions about memo and CardioFlex, (2) Clear near-recant moment where she\
    \ claims to have 'overstated risks' and memory tricks, (3) Thomas takes decisive\
    \ action by abandoning script, lowering voice, invoking oath, listing dead families,\
    \ and placing memo with names before her\u2014directly influencing her decision,\
    \ (4) Turning point executed perfectly when she breaks and confesses 'Yes. We\
    \ buried the reports.' with full details. All must-not items avoided: she struggles\
    \ internally before truth-telling, Thomas actively influences outcome through\
    \ persuasion rather than passive questioning, defense loses, no deus ex machina.\
    \ Character consistency strong (Thomas's moral conflict, Dr. Okonkwo's maternal\
    \ desperation, CEO's manipulation). Bridge seamless\u2014climax flows naturally\
    \ from rising action's setup and into falling action's consequences. Minor deduction\
    \ (0.05) on character score for Judge Wright's appearance feeling slightly rushed\
    \ at end. Continuity perfect\u2014courtroom setting, all characters positioned\
    \ logically, timeline coherent."
