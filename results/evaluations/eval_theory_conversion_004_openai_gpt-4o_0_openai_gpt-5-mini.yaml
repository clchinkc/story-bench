  evidence: "All eight Dan Harmon beats are present and correctly ordered (You, Need,\
    \ Go, Search, Find, Take, Return, Change). All eight required elements (Zoe, library/oral-history\
    \ program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard Park, Zoe's social anxiety, town-hall presentation,\
    \ Bernard's death, journalism application) appear. Small deduction on structural_accuracy\
    \ (0.90 rather than 1.0) because the 'Take' beat\u2014typically involving a meaningful\
    \ cost or sacrifice\u2014reads primarily as taking responsibility and public success\
    \ rather than a clearly delineated price paid; otherwise the sequence and transitions\
    \ are tightly aligned. Tone remains gentle, intimate, and emotionally true."
