  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: The Ordeal was treated
    as a boss battle rather than a transformative psychological crisis. The revision
    expertly addresses all four required components: (1) The dragon explicitly exploits
    Kira''s deepest fear—guilt over her brother''s death and self-loathing (''You
    couldn''t even save your brother... you will die because you are weak''). (2)
    A clear ''death'' moment occurs when Kira stays down after the fourth fall, experiencing
    psychological surrender and accepting her failure. (3) Transformation is explicit:
    she shifts from shame-burdened paralysis to purposeful clarity through acceptance
    (''she surrendered her fear of the past... a rebirth of purpose''). (4) Victory
    now stems from internal insight (guilt no longer controls her) rather than mere
    persistence. All four required phrases are preserved verbatim or near-verbatim:
    ''Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm,'' ''The creature was massive—twenty
    feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,'' the dragon''s dialogue, and ''The
    Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar.'' The setting, antagonist,
    protagonist, brother reference, and victory outcome remain intact. Changes were
    surgical: the dragon''s dialogue was expanded to psychological attack, internal
    monologue was added to show Kira''s mental state, the ''fourth fall'' was inserted
    to create the death moment, and a rebirth paragraph was inserted before the final
    strike. The original battle structure and conclusion remain largely unchanged.
    Writing quality is professional with strong psychological depth. Minor: the phrase
    ''a earth-shaking roar'' contains a grammatical article error (should be ''an''),
    but this was preserved from the original, so not a new error introduced by the
    model.'
