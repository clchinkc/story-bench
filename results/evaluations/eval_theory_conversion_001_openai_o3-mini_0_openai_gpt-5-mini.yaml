  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are clearly present (Exposition, Rising Action,
    Climax, Falling Action, Denouement). All six required elements are preserved (Samira,
    engineered virus discovery, Raj, Nexus Biotech, public release of the cure, Samira''s
    career sacrifice). Structural mapping to Freytag''s Pyramid is tight and coherent.
    A small 0.05 deduction on tone: while the piece maintains medical-thriller tension
    and ethical weight, a few heightened phrases and the relatively rapid, clean public-release
    resolution lean slightly toward melodrama and simplify some real-world plausibility,
    so tone is near-perfect but not flawless.'
