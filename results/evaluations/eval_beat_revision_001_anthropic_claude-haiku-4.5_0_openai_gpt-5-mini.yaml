  evidence: 'The model addressed the correct flaw: it turned the Ordeal from a mere
    tough fight into an internal crisis by having the dragon exploit Kira''s guilt
    over her brother, producing a moment where she accepts possible death (symbolic
    death), and then a rebirth/transformation leading to victory grounded in acceptance
    and insight. All four required elements (Shadow Dragon, Kira with sword, reference
    to brother''s death, Kira''s victory) and the four required phrases are preserved
    verbatim or with minimal additions. Changes were moderate—more than surgical edits
    because significant internal material was added to satisfy the beat, but the original
    setting, outcome, and key lines were retained. Writing is strong overall; a minor
    grammar nit ("a earth-shaking roar") remains from the preserved text but no new
    substantive errors were introduced.'
