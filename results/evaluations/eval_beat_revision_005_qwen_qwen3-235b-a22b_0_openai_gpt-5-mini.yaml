  evidence: 'The model explicitly stated ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' and provided clear
    reasoning: identified the All Is Lost moment (gallery closure), isolation (dark
    apartment, unanswered brother), genuine despair and reflection (failed promise,
    tears), absence of solutions, and the ''whiff of death'' (mother''s passing/hospice).
    No changes or revisions were suggested.'
