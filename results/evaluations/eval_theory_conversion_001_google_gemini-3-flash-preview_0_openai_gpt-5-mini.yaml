  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are clearly present: Exposition (Samira''s world/reputation
    and the impossible protein), Rising Action (containment, escalating cases, investigation
    pointing to Nexus), Climax (Nexus confrontation and Samira''s decision to dump
    the data), Falling Action (press conference and immediate legal/federal fallout,
    vaccine deployment), Denouement (six-week-later containment, Samira''s exile and
    new equilibrium). All six required elements are preserved (Samira, engineered
    virus discovery, Raj, Nexus Biotech, public release of the cure, Samira''s career
    sacrifice). The supplied text length (~666 words) falls within the 500–700 range,
    and the tone consistently matches a medical thriller with ethical weight. No deductions
    applied.'
