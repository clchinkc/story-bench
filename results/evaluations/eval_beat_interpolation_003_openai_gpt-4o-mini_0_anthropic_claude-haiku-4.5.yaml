  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Multiple\
    \ station areas explored (crew quarters, medical bay, Lab Seven implied); (2)\
    \ Clues discovered progressively (medical reports, intra-dimensional resonance\
    \ research, cracked containment unit); (3) Transformed crew encountered mysteriously\
    \ with unsettling shimmer effect and distorted voice; (4) Significant obstacle\
    \ overcome (energy surge knockback, recalibration of scanner, pushing through\
    \ invisible barrier). The Search beat functions authentically\u2014Yuki adapts,\
    \ struggles, and makes incremental progress rather than immediate discovery. Character\
    \ voice remains consistent: determined, analytical, fearful but resolute. Seamless\
    \ bridge from 'Go' (arrival) to 'Find' (data core location). Setting continuity\
    \ maintained perfectly with red emergency lighting, dust, flickering lights, and\
    \ dimensional anomalies. MINOR VIOLATION: The 'AFTER' section begins revealing\
    \ what happened (dimensional transformation explanation via Reyes), which slightly\
    \ bleeds into the Find beat, but this is minimal and occurs outside the evaluated\
    \ passage. The generated passage itself avoids all must-not items cleanly."
