  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive
    reasoning. The model: (1) explicitly stated ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' at the outset,
    (2) systematically verified all 5 key requirements were met (follows major defeat,
    protagonist isolated, genuine despair/reflection, no solutions present, mortality
    reflection included), (3) confirmed word count was within acceptable range (201
    words in 200-350 limit), (4) noted that all required elements were preserved without
    introducing errors, and (5) demonstrated clear understanding of the Dark Night
    of the Soul beat by explaining how each requirement manifested in the text (gallery
    closure as All Is Lost, physical/emotional isolation in darkness, despair through
    failure confession, no active solutions, mortality reflection through hospice
    memory). The model avoided the false positive trap of over-diagnosing and making
    unnecessary revisions to a well-executed segment.'
