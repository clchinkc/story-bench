  evidence: "All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-delineated: (1) Exposition\
    \ establishes Samira's 15-year reputation, Patient Zero's anomaly, and the initial\
    \ CDC call; (2) Rising Action depicts the 72-hour containment blur, escalating\
    \ patient arrivals, and the discovery of Nexus Biotech connection; (3) Climax\
    \ occurs at the revelation that the virus is engineered and Samira's agonizing\
    \ choice to expose Nexus despite professional consequences; (4) Falling Action\
    \ unfolds through the chaotic press conference and simultaneous cure broadcast;\
    \ (5) Denouement resolves with contained outbreak, Nexus investigation, and Samira's\
    \ new equilibrium of unemployment but moral victory. All 6 core elements preserved:\
    \ protagonist (Samira), engineered virus discovery, Raj (supporting character\
    \ present throughout), Nexus Biotech (clear antagonist), public cure release (climactic\
    \ action), career sacrifice (denouement consequence). Structural accuracy is excellent\u2014\
    the conversion successfully transforms 3-act linearity into 5-act pyramid architecture\
    \ with proper escalation and de-escalation. Tone remains consistently tense and\
    \ ethically weighted throughout, balancing medical thriller urgency with moral\
    \ dilemma weight. Minor deduction (0.05) for structural accuracy: the transition\
    \ between Rising Action and Climax could be slightly sharper in demarcation, though\
    \ the revelation moment is sufficiently impactful. Minor tone deduction (0.1):\
    \ final denouement section slightly softens thriller tension with 'quiet sense\
    \ of peace,' though this appropriately reflects the resolution phase."
