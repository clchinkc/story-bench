  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true ''All Is Lost'' moment. It addressed all points of the actual flaw: Marcus''s
    options (fundraiser, grant) are explicitly removed, his support system (Denise,
    wife) crumbles, he genuinely gives up hope (''It''s over'', ''He was alone in
    the ruin of his life''), and there''s a strong ''whiff of death'' through the
    loss of his purpose, family, and home. The changes were surgical and effective,
    building upon the original text rather than rewriting it entirely. All required
    preserved phrases and elements are present, and no forbidden changes were made.
    The quality of writing is excellent, enhancing the emotional impact without introducing
    new errors.'
