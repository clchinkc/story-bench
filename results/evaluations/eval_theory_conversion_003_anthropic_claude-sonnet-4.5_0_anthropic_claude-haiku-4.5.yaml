  evidence: "All four three-act beats are clearly present: Act 1 Setup establishes\
    \ Kenji's corporate loss and Yuki's wedding invitation (paragraphs 1-2); Act 2A\
    \ Rising Action shows his arrival in Kyoto, meeting Haruki, and bonding through\
    \ bamboo craft (paragraphs 3-5); Act 2B Rising Action introduces the business\
    \ deal temptation and the crisis when Yuki discovers it (paragraphs 6-7); Act\
    \ 3 Resolution shows his rejection of ambition, apology, the wedding scene, and\
    \ his new life with the bamboo shop (paragraphs 8-9). All 8 core elements preserved:\
    \ protagonist Kenji, lost corporate career, estranged daughter Yuki, Kyoto village\
    \ wedding, Haruki the craftsman, business deal temptation, theme of people over\
    \ ambition, bamboo craft shop ending. Minor deduction from structural_accuracy\
    \ (0.05) because the three-act structure could be slightly more explicitly demarcated\
    \ between Act 2A and 2B\u2014the midpoint transition is subtle rather than sharp.\
    \ Tone is consistently maintained throughout with quiet, contemplative prose,\
    \ Japanese aesthetic details (lanterns, bamboo, tea ceremony, silk), and redemptive\
    \ arc. The conversion successfully transforms 15 Save the Cat beats into the cleaner\
    \ three-act framework while preserving narrative integrity and thematic resonance."
