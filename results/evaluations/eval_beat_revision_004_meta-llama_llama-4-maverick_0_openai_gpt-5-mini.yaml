  evidence: "The model clearly targeted the 'telling vs. showing' flaw by converting\
    \ much of the exposition into a scene: Rachel arrives with coffee and jazz on\
    \ the radio, greets colleagues, exchanges dialogue with Detective James Oyelaran,\
    \ scans reports, and glances at cold-case files\u2014showing some traits through\
    \ action. It preserved all required elements and phrases (Detective Rachel Torres;\
    \ Detective James Oyelaran; cat Sherlock; Tuesday morning in October) and kept\
    \ the Queens apartment and other story anchors. However, some telling remains\
    \ (the paragraph summarizing how she found Sherlock and that her career took precedence\
    \ after a failed engagement), and the depiction of her detective instincts and\
    \ devotion to cold cases is only lightly dramatized (a narrowed eye and a glance\
    \ at files rather than investigative action). Changes were moderate rather than\
    \ purely surgical: structure and wording were rewritten into a scene but original\
    \ facts were retained."
