  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: The Ordeal was executed
    as a mere boss battle rather than a transformative psychological crisis. The revision
    precisely addresses all four required corrections: (1) Dragon exploits Kira''s
    deepest fear—guilt over brother''s death, explicitly naming her paralysis and
    failure; (2) Clear ''death'' moment—pinned beneath the dragon, psychologically
    crushed by truth, ''darkness closed in,'' experiencing symbolic death; (3) Rebirth/transformation—memory
    of brother''s words (''Live'') triggers lightning-bolt realization that she''s
    been running toward death, not life; (4) Victory from insight—she now fights for
    survival and future, not redemption, and defeats dragon with ''crystal clarity''
    born from this understanding. All 4 required phrases preserved exactly: ''Kira
    faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm,'' ''The creature was massive—twenty
    feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,'' ''You cannot defeat me, child,'' the
    dragon rumbled,'' and ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar.''
    The 4 core elements (Shadow Dragon, Kira with sword, brother''s death reference,
    victory) all intact. Changes were surgical but not minimal—approximately 60% of
    original text retained, 40% replaced with psychological depth. The expansion was
    necessary and justified to fix the flaw. Writing quality is professional with
    no new errors; the internal monologue and memory integration are well-executed.
    Minor deduction from minimal_change_score reflects the substantial additions needed
    to achieve psychological depth, though these additions were essential and well-integrated
    rather than extraneous.'
