  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Act 1 (Setup) establishes Kenji''s empty office, lost career, estrangement from
    Yuki, and the letter as inciting incident. Act 2A (Rising Action, First Half)
    covers his arrival in Kyoto, meeting Yuki, and bonding with Haruki through bamboo
    work. Act 2B (Rising Action, Second Half) introduces the business deal temptation,
    Yuki''s discovery and rejection, and Kenji''s moral choice. Act 3 (Resolution)
    shows his refusal of the deal, the wedding day reconciliation, and the bamboo
    shop denouement. All 8 core elements are preserved with depth and nuance. Tone
    is consistently quiet, contemplative, and infused with Japanese aesthetic sensibilities
    (tatami, shrine, bamboo, formal bows, cicadas). Theme of choosing people over
    ambition is woven throughout and crystallized in the climactic decision. DEDUCTIONS:
    Word count (1322) significantly exceeds target range (550-750), representing 76%
    overage. This violates the structural constraint, though the content quality remains
    high. Structural accuracy is near-perfect but loses minor points for the extended
    length affecting pacing efficiency. The conversion successfully transforms Save
    the Cat''s 15-beat granularity into Aristotle''s 3-act framework without losing
    narrative coherence or thematic resonance.'
