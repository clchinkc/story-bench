  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the Three-Act
    Structure, hitting all major plot points. The tone is perfectly maintained. The
    only minor structural issue is that the 'First Plot Point' (Kenji boarding the
    train) feels a bit early for the end of Act 1, and the 'Second Plot Point' (Yuki
    telling him not to come to the wedding) feels a bit late for the end of Act 2B,
    making Act 2 feel slightly unbalanced in length. However, all required elements
    are present and well-executed within the structure.
