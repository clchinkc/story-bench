  evidence: "All five Freytag beats are present: Exposition (Samira, lab, status quo),\
    \ Rising Action (quarantine, escalating cases, investigation), Climax (discovery\
    \ of engineered genome and tense Nexus confrontation/choice), Falling Action (press\
    \ conference, distribution of cure, immediate aftermath), Denouement (six-week\
    \ resolution and new equilibrium). All six core elements are preserved. Small\
    \ deductions: the climax and falling action are tightly interwoven (the revelation,\
    \ corporate face-off, and public release occur in quick succession), which slightly\
    \ compresses the turning-point distinctness expected in a textbook Freytag arc.\
    \ Tone is strong\u2014medical-thriller tension with ethical weight\u2014so only\
    \ a minor deduction for occasional narrative polish that leans cinematic. Word\
    \ count flagged invalid per provided constraint (998 words; required 500\u2013\
    700)."
