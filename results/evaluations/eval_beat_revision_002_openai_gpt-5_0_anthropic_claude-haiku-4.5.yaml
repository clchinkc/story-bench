  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: Marcus still had multiple
    viable options and support systems intact, preventing a true ''All Is Lost'' beat.
    The revision systematically eliminates all escape routes: (1) fundraiser fails
    via platform freeze, (2) grant explicitly denied, (3) board resigns, (4) Denise
    betrays him by accepting the developer''s offer, (5) wife leaves with their daughter.
    The ''whiff of death'' is powerfully executed through the erasure of the mural
    and Jamal''s photo—a metaphorical death of his life''s work and identity. Marcus
    is left isolated, without options, and emotionally devastated. All 4 required
    phrases are preserved verbatim or near-verbatim: opening line intact, ''Thirty
    days to vacate the community center'' present, Denise''s dialogue preserved, ''He
    rubbed his temples'' included. All 4 story elements maintained: Marcus as protagonist,
    community center setting, eviction crisis, Denise present throughout. Changes
    were substantial but surgical—the model expanded the scene from ~180 words to
    332 words by adding specific failure moments, betrayal, sensory details (paint,
    trophy case, primer smell), and the wife''s voicemail. The expansion serves the
    beat requirement rather than padding. Minor weakness: the revision is longer than
    minimal edits would suggest, though each addition directly addresses a requirement.
    Writing quality is strong with vivid sensory details and emotional authenticity,
    though the pacing becomes slightly dense in places.'
