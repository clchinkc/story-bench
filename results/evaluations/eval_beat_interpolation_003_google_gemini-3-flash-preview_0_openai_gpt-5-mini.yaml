  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple ship areas
    (Crew Quarters, Commander Reyes’s cabin, Medical Bay, vents, research wing), discovers
    clues (desiccated meal, exotic particles, shattered vials, security override),
    encounters transformed crew as mysterious flickers/shadows (no direct explanations),
    and overcomes obstacles (dead-locked blast door, venting gravity, rewiring logic
    board). None of the forbidden items occur (she does not immediately find the data
    core or fully understand the transformation, the crew do not explain, she does
    not leave, and she did not already know). Character behavior is consistent and
    the scene bridges cleanly into the following ''Find'' beat with no continuity
    issues.'
