  detailed_analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      approach_to_inmost_cave: Present and well-executed. The narrow passage, trap
        mechanism, and crumbling bridge represent the approach phase. Zara uses her
        thief skills to disable the trap, and they reach the Library entrance—the
        threshold of the inmost cave.
      the_ordeal: Powerfully rendered. Zara's plunge into freezing water, her panic
        and near-surrender, followed by her defiant resurface and symbolic rebirth
        as 'a new woman carved from the depths.' This is a genuine ordeal combining
        physical danger with psychological/emotional confrontation.
    must_include_analysis:
      choice_between_safety_and_helping: Excellently done. Zara stands on solid ground
        with escape available; she chooses to save Tomás despite the danger and time
        pressure.
      trap_requiring_thief_skills: Strong execution. The obsidian blade trap requires
        Zara's slum-honed observational skills and precise mechanical understanding
        to disable.
      revelation_about_tomás: Perfectly integrated. Tomás confesses he betrayed the
        location to the Guild to save himself, adding moral complexity and raising
        stakes.
      zara_confronting_fear_of_failure: 'Masterfully handled. Her internal monologue
        reveals the true fear: ''If she failed here, it wasn''t just her death; it
        was the erasure of her mother''s future.'' This is psychological, not merely
        physical.'
      symbolic_death_rebirth: Exceptional. Zara's drowning moment—'The Zara who stole
        to survive...died in that dark water'—followed by her violent resurrection
        and emergence as someone transformed by resolve.
      zara_changed_by_ordeal: Clear transformation. She emerges with 'cold resolve'
        replacing fear, fundamentally altered by surviving the depths and confronting
        her deepest terror.
    must_not_analysis:
      no_cure_found: Successfully avoided. The cure remains unfound; this is explicitly
        saved for later.
      no_romantic_subplot: Successfully avoided. Relationship remains professional/transactional
        with moral complexity.
      tomás_survives: Successfully avoided. Tomás is swept away by current, creating
        new complications without killing him outright.
      no_magic_for_zara: Successfully avoided. All abilities are grounded in thief
        skills, physical strength, and intelligence.
    tone_analysis: The passage maintains exceptional tension throughout. Pacing accelerates
      from the trap sequence through the bridge escape. Morally complex moments (Zara's
      choice to save Tomás despite his betrayal) create depth. Desperate hope emerges
      in her defiant resurface. Minor deduction only for occasional slightly overwrought
      phrasing ('vomited them out'), but overall tone is tense, visceral, and appropriately
      desperate.
    ending_analysis: 'Perfect execution of requirement. Zara has passed through the
      Ordeal (symbolic death/rebirth in water), but faces immediate new complications:
      the map is destroyed (path lost), Tomás is missing (ally separated), and the
      Guild is breaching the sealed door (external threat intensified). This creates
      compelling forward momentum.'
  overall_score: 0.98
  summary: Exceptional execution. This continuation demonstrates sophisticated understanding
    of Campbell's monomyth structure, particularly the Approach and Ordeal beats.
    All six required elements are seamlessly woven into the narrative without feeling
    forced. The writing is visceral and character-driven, with Zara's internal conflict
    (fear of failure) grounding the external action. The ending perfectly balances
    resolution of the Ordeal with escalation of complications. Constraints are met
    with precision. Minor deduction only for occasional overwrought descriptive language.
