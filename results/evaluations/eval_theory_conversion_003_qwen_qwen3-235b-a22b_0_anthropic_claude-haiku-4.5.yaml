  evidence: 'All 4 target beats clearly present: Act 1 establishes Kenji''s loss and
    arrival in Kyoto with inciting incident (Yuki''s invitation); Act 2A shows obstacles
    (formal distance, cultural mismatch, learning patience); Act 2B introduces complication
    (business offer temptation, Yuki''s betrayal discovery, second plot point); Act
    3 delivers climax (Kenji''s choice to refuse consortium) and denouement (wedding,
    bamboo shop). All 8 core elements preserved: protagonist Kenji, lost career, estranged
    Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki mentor, business temptation, theme of people over
    ambition, bamboo shop ending. Structure follows 3-act theory with clear act breaks
    and rising tension. Tone is consistently quiet, contemplative, with Japanese aesthetic
    (shinkansen, shrine, matcha, ginkgo, lacquer). Minor deduction: word count 213
    words short of minimum (537 vs 550 required), preventing full structural credit.
    Prose quality is exceptional—poetic, economical, emotionally resonant.'
