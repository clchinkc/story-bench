  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: the original segment was
    pure exposition-through-telling (info-dump style) with no scene, action, or sensory
    grounding. The revision transforms this into a SHOWN scene that reveals character
    through behavior. Key corrections: (1) Rachel''s detective instincts shown through
    her cold case work and the Jensen file discovery, not stated; (2) Partnership
    with James demonstrated through natural dialogue, anticipation, and synchronized
    work rhythm rather than summary; (3) Her devotion to cases revealed through 5:47
    AM pre-dawn review and ''haunt this thing until it breaks'' rather than told;
    (4) Setting established through sensory details (worn file edge, cold coffee,
    Miles Davis, October leaves, waterfront condos) rather than summary description;
    (5) Sherlock integrated naturally into the scene (butting her leg, scar tissue
    catching light) with organic backstory reference. All 4 required phrases preserved
    exactly: ''Detective Rachel Torres,'' ''Detective James Oyelaran,'' ''cat named
    Sherlock,'' ''Tuesday morning in October.'' All 5 elements maintained: protagonist,
    partner, cat, Queens setting, October timing. Changes were surgical—the model
    kept the core character facts and relationships but converted them from exposition-dump
    to lived scene. The final line ''Everything was about to change'' signals the
    approaching inciting incident, properly framing this as true Exposition. Minor
    deduction from minimal_change_score (0.85 vs 1.0) because the revision is substantially
    restructured as a scene rather than a line-edit, though this restructuring was
    necessary and appropriate to fix the flaw. Writing quality is professional with
    no new errors introduced.'
