  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: (1) Sarah explicitly considers
    recanting; (2) she calls Marcus and they discuss going through Internal Affairs/protective
    detail/feds; (3) internal conflict between duty and saving her sister is clear;
    (4) the conversation with Marcus tips her toward going off-book. The passage performs
    the Debate beat well—wrestling with choices, seeking counsel, and committing at
    the end—without violating any must-not constraints (no immediate, unexamined decision,
    no one else making the choice, no prior resignation, no direct confrontation).
    Character voice and continuity with the Catalyst and subsequent Break Into Two
    are consistent.'
