  detailed_analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      approach_to_inmost_cave: Excellently executed. The massive door with bronze-and-bone
        lock mechanism, the inscriptions about 'Trial of Worth,' and Zara's moment
        of paralysis before forcing herself to work through the lock all clearly mark
        this beat. The lock-picking challenge is the perfect threshold guardian moment.
      ordeal: "Masterfully rendered. The flooded chamber with submerged passage forces\
        \ Zara into genuine physical and psychological danger. The drowning sequence\u2014\
        'lungs burned and her vision spotted'\u2014creates visceral tension. The symbolic\
        \ death/rebirth is explicit and powerful."
    must_include_analysis:
      choice_between_escape_and_helping: "Present and impactful. Zara hesitates at\
        \ the threshold when Tom\xE1s falls into the pit trap, her mother's face flashing\
        \ through her mind before she chooses to save him. The internal conflict is\
        \ clear."
      trap_requiring_thief_skills: Present and well-integrated. The bronze-and-bone
        lock mechanism requires her picking skills and intuition. She must 'feel rather
        than force' it, showing mastery of her craft.
      "revelation_about_tom\xE1s": "Present and effective. Tom\xE1s reveals he seeks\
        \ the Book of Undoing to restore his Academy position. The betrayal lands\
        \ emotionally: 'We're both thieves, then... But the betrayal still stung.'"
      confronting_fear_of_failure: 'Excellently present. The passage explicitly addresses
        her psychological fear: ''What if she couldn''t do this? What if all her skills...
        weren''t enough?'' This is internal, not just physical danger. Her realization
        about being ''terrified of not being enough'' is the core of this beat.'
      symbolic_death_rebirth: "Powerfully executed. The drowning sequence is literal\
        \ and metaphorical: 'The old Zara\u2014the frightened girl who stole because\
        \ she didn't believe she deserved better\u2014died in that water.' She emerges\
        \ 'different. Harder. Clearer.'"
      emergence_changed: 'Clear and convincing. Post-Ordeal Zara is explicitly transformed:
        ''When she surfaced... she was different.'' The psychological shift from fear-driven
        to purposeful is evident.'
    must_not_analysis:
      no_cure_found: Successfully avoided. Zara reaches the library entrance but hasn't
        obtained the cure.
      no_romantic_subplot: Successfully avoided. Relationship remains professional/transactional
        with betrayal undertones.
      "tom\xE1s_survives": "Successfully avoided. Tom\xE1s is alive and present throughout."
      no_supernatural_abilities: Successfully avoided. All of Zara's abilities are
        grounded in thief skills and human determination.
    tone_analysis: "The tone is consistently tense and morally complex. Zara's internal\
      \ conflict about Tom\xE1s, her fear of inadequacy, and the desperate hope of\
      \ finding a cure for her mother all weave together effectively. The prose balances\
      \ action with introspection. Minor deduction only because the tone could have\
      \ been slightly darker in moments, though this is a minor critique."
    ending_analysis: "Perfect execution. Zara has passed through the Ordeal and emerged\
      \ transformed, but the final line\u2014'The Scorpion Guild had found another\
      \ way through'\u2014introduces a new complication that propels the narrative\
      \ forward. This sets up the Resurrection beat beautifully."
    strengths:
    - Both required beats are fully realized and interconnected
    - All six must-include elements are present and well-integrated
    - Character development is genuine and earned through action
    - The symbolic death/rebirth in the water is particularly strong
    - Pacing balances action, revelation, and introspection effectively
    - Ending provides both closure on the Ordeal and forward momentum
    minor_observations:
    - The tone is excellent but could have pushed slightly darker given the stakes
    - "Tom\xE1s's character could have been developed slightly more, though his limited\
      \ presence serves the story"
