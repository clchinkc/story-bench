  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he provides both a satchel and a brass compass plus practical wisdom; Elena''s
    panic shifts to reluctant curiosity/acceptance; Marcus frames her librarian skills
    as useful. None of the forbidden items occur: Elena does not become immediately
    confident, Marcus does not solve her problems or offer to accompany her, she is
    in the shop (not the forest), and she does not discover magical powers. Character
    voices and behavior are consistent, and the scene cleanly bridges the refusal
    and the forthcoming threshold-crossing without continuity issues.'
