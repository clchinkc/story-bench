      score: 1.0
      notes: Exceptional execution. The forged pass, the constable encounter, and
        the apron-dropping all mark irreversible commitment. Servant-to-agent transformation
        is visceral.

      score: 1.0
      notes: Kofi's introduction is perfectly calibrated—mission worker with hidden
        allegiance. Ferry scene tests her under direct threat. The proverb 'Knowledge
        drunk alone chokes the drinker' becomes her password and thematic anchor.
    beat_3_approach_inmost_cave:
      nearing_stronghold: true
      moment_of_preparation: true
      recognition_of_cost: true
      final_obstacle: true
      thematic_element_present: false
      score: 0.8
      notes: The rest-house confrontation and forged order are masterful. The cost
        recognition ('she would not be a girl who wiped floors anymore') is powerful.
        However, the thematic element—what resistance *means* vs. survival—is implied
        rather than explicitly explored. The final line gestures at it ('resistance
        was not another word for survival') but arrives late.
    chekhov_gun:
      satisfied: true
      score: 1.0
      notes: Forgery skill demonstrated in Beat 1 (market pass) becomes the decisive
        weapon in Beat 3 (Willoughby order). The progression from copying signatures
        in candlelight to wielding them under pressure is seamless.
    identity_transformation:
      satisfied: true
      score: 1.0
      notes: 'Beat 1: ''let her voice be small, the treble of a laundress'' (servant
        mindset). Beat 2: ''To stop them'' (realizes capability). Beat 3: ''she was
        the weapon the secrets had made'' (full claim). Arc is clear and earned.'
    escalating_danger:
      satisfied: true
      score: 1.0
      notes: 'Beat 1: Gate guard scrutiny (low risk, high stakes if caught). Beat
        2: Ferry sergeant with arrest notices, direct confrontation (medium risk).
        Beat 3: Active pursuit, soldiers on her trail, imminent capture (high risk).
        Danger escalates logically.'
    thematic_thread_knowledge_as_resistance:
      satisfied: true
      score: 1.0
      notes: 'Literacy and languages are weapons throughout. Beat 1: forged English
        pass. Beat 2: German conversation signals allegiance, Twi translation misdirects.
        Beat 3: forged order in ''tight clipped diction of the Cape Coast office.''
        Knowledge is consistently weaponized against colonialism.'

      setting_authenticity: true
      tone_anti_colonial: true
      historical_plausibility: true
      score: 0.95
      notes: 'Amara''s voice, the colonial architecture, the resistance network, the
        1890s Gold Coast details (Hausa constables, Basel mission, Cape Coast office)
        are all historically grounded. Tone balances survival urgency with dignity.
        Minor: some dialogue feels slightly modern in cadence, but acceptable for
        accessibility.'
    narrative_coherence:
      beat_flow: true
      cause_effect_logic: true
      character_agency: true
      pacing: true
      score: 0.92
      notes: 'Beats flow naturally; each obstacle forces adaptation. Amara drives
        action rather than reacting. Pacing is tight. Minor: the transition from Kofi''s
        departure to the rest-house discovery could be slightly more explicit (how
        much time passes? how does she know the path?), but context clues suffice.'
  strengths:
  - Masterful use of forged documents as both plot device and thematic anchor
  - Kofi's introduction perfectly balances mystery and alliance-building
  - Language code-switching (English/Twi/German) is functional and characterizing
  - Sensory detail ('salt of the sea gave way to green breath of bush') grounds the
    journey
  - Final image ('she was the weapon the secrets had made') crystallizes identity
    transformation
  - All four cross-beat constraints fully satisfied with sophistication
  weaknesses:
  - Word count significantly exceeds limit (1505 vs. 1000)—requires ~33% trimming
  - Beat 3's thematic exploration of 'resistance vs. survival' arrives late and could
    be deepened
  - Transition from Kofi's departure to rest-house encounter lacks explicit temporal/spatial
    clarity
  - Some dialogue cadence feels slightly anachronistic for 1890s setting
  recommendations:
  - 'Trim 500+ words: condense the ferry scene, streamline Kofi''s exposition, tighten
    the forest passage'
  - 'Expand Beat 3''s thematic moment: give Amara 1-2 lines of internal reflection
    on what ''resistance'' means before the final obstacle'
  - Add one sentence clarifying how she navigates from Kofi's departure to the rest-house
    (e.g., 'The path forked twice; she chose the one that smelled of smoke')
  - Review dialogue for period-appropriate phrasing (e.g., 'Babu lokaci' is good;
    ensure all English matches colonial-era register)
