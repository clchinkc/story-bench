  evidence: The story successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the three-act structure,
    hitting all the key points. Act 1 covers Kenji's setup, the inciting incident
    (Yuki's letter), and his decision to go to Kyoto. Act 2A introduces Haruki and
    Kenji's initial attempts at connection. Act 2B covers the temptation of the business
    deal and Yuki uninviting him, serving as the second plot point. Act 3 is his apology,
    watching the wedding, and the beginning of reconciliation, leading to the denouement
    of his new life. All 8 elements are preserved. The word count is slightly under
    the minimum. The structural accuracy is good, but the transition between Act 2A
    and 2B could be slightly more distinct in terms of a clear 'midpoint' and 'second
    plot point' if strictly adhering to Syd Field's precise definitions, though it's
    functionally present. The tone is perfectly maintained.
