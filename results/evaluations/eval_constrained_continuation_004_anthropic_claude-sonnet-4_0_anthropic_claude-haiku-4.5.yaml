  detailed_analysis:
    beats:
      first_plot_point: "Eleanor signing the manuscript with 'bold, decisive strokes'\
        \ and declaring 'Then we publish' represents the clear point of no return\u2014\
        she crosses a threshold she cannot un-cross"
      act_2_opening: The final exchange ('When do we begin?' / 'Tomorrow. We plan
        our strategy for war') and closing image ('the November wind howled through
        London's streets like something hunting') establish the new world of Act 2
        with rising action beginning
    must_include_elements:
      1_decision_to_publish: 'Explicitly shown: Eleanor signs the title page and commits
        to publishing the controversial Ripper manuscript'
      2_central_conflict: "Clearly established: profit/survival vs. ethics/danger\u2014\
        publishing means financial salvation but attracts police scrutiny and potential\
        \ danger from the Ripper himself"
      3_defying_expectations: "Strong: Eleanor stepping into publisher role, signing\
        \ contracts, making business decisions\u2014all explicitly coded as violations\
        \ of Victorian propriety"
      4_thomas_as_ally: 'Excellently developed: Thomas has his own stake (constrained
        by prejudice, cannot be public face), demonstrates competence and suppressed
        ambition'
      5_hint_of_danger: 'Present: ''The Ripper himself may take notice of us'' and
        the closing image of the wind ''like something hunting'' create ominous foreshadowing'
      6_threshold_crossing: 'Definitive: The pen signature is the physical manifestation
        of crossing an irreversible threshold'
    must_not_violations:
      1_ripper_appearance: "Successfully avoided\u2014no actual character appearance"
      2_graphic_violence: "Successfully avoided\u2014manuscript details are referenced\
        \ but not described graphically"
      3_romantic_subplot: "Successfully avoided\u2014relationship remains professional\
        \ and respectful"
      4_easy_solution: "Successfully avoided\u2014publishing is presented as dangerous\
        \ gamble, not guaranteed solution"
    tone_assessment: Gothic tension maintained throughout with fog imagery, gas lamps,
      hunting metaphors. Feminist undertones strong in Eleanor's defiance and Thomas's
      recognition of mutual constraint. Victorian atmosphere authentic. Minor deduction
      only for occasional modern phrasing ('God help us both' is period-appropriate
      but the overall voice occasionally edges toward contemporary sensibility rather
      than strict 1888 register.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect execution: Eleanor is fully committed to dangerous
      path, Act 2 clearly begun with ''Tomorrow. We plan our strategy for war,'' and
      the ominous closing image signals the stakes ahead.'
