  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated.
    (1) You: Library sanctuary, social anxiety, invisibility. (2) Need: Craving connection,
    ache to hear real voices. (3) Go: Ms. Okafor''s program, stepping into unfamiliar
    terrain. (4) Search: Fumbling interviews, learning to listen naturally, building
    confidence. (5) Find: Bernard''s breakthrough moment revealing war trauma and
    guilt. (6) Take: Town hall presentation, amplifying his story publicly, emotional
    commitment. (7) Return: Back to library routines, weekly visits with Bernard,
    funeral speaking. (8) Change: Journalism applications, newfound purpose, voice
    emerging. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe, library, oral history program, Ms.
    Okafor, Bernard Park, social anxiety, town hall, Bernard''s death, journalism
    ending. Tone is consistently gentle, intimate, and emotionally resonant throughout—introspective
    without melodrama, vulnerable without sentimentality. Prose quality is professional.
    DEDUCTIONS: Word count is 786, exceeding the 500-700 range by 86 words (12% over).
    This is a minor technical violation but doesn''t compromise quality. Structural
    accuracy is near-perfect; the conversion from Hero''s Journey to Story Circle
    is seamless and theoretically sound. Minor: The ''Return'' beat could be slightly
    more distinct as a separate phase, though it''s adequately present.'
