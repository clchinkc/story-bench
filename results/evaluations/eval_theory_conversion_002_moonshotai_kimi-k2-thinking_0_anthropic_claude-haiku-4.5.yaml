  evidence: 'All 12 Hero''s Journey beats are present and clearly articulated: (1)
    Ordinary World—Maya''s quiet pottery life; (2) Call to Adventure—dry spring, elders''
    request; (3) Refusal—''I make bowls,'' her trembling hands, desire to refuse;
    (4) Meeting the Mentor—grandmother''s dream visitation with stone; (5) Crossing
    Threshold—dawn departure, mountain trail; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—storm, loose
    stones, doubt (enemies); fox and sacred clay (allies); (7) Approach to Inmost
    Cave—shrine emerges from mist; (8) Ordeal—reading journal, understanding surrender,
    night of doubt; (9) Reward—creating the asymmetric vessel, the knowing; (10) Road
    Back—heavy journey home, twice considering abandonment; (11) Resurrection—final
    test at spring, pouring water, whispered words; (12) Return with Elixir—spring
    sings, Maya transformed, knowledge of listening over control. All 7 core elements
    preserved: Maya (protagonist), pottery/ceramics (central skill), grandmother''s
    legacy (journal, dream, techniques), mountain shrine (three-day journey), dried
    spring (central problem), surrender theme (explicit throughout), transformation
    (final paragraph). Structural accuracy slightly reduced (0.95) because the ''Enemies''
    beat is somewhat abstract (doubt, trembling) rather than concrete antagonistic
    forces, though this serves the meditative tone well. Tone is exceptional—quiet,
    lyrical, meditative language (''sea mist kissed redwoods,'' ''voice like wind
    through grass,'' ''hands moved like water'') maintains contemplative quality throughout.
    Word count exactly 777, within valid range.'
