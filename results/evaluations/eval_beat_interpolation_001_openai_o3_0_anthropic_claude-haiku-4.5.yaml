  evidence: 'All four required elements present: (1) Marcus introduced as mentor with
    clear characterization (scars, bright eyes, experience); (2) Practical wisdom
    delivered (''Organization, observation, cataloging keep you alive'') and tangible
    tools provided (satchel with specific items); (3) Elena''s doubt shifts to reluctant
    acceptance (''tremor of possibility stirred beneath her doubt,'' takes the satchel,
    takes first step); (4) Librarian skills explicitly reframed as useful (''You catalog
    stories. Now one of them is asking to be written from the inside''). All must-not
    violations avoided: Elena remains doubtful and hesitant, not confident; Marcus
    explicitly does not accompany her (''turning back to his spyglass''); setting
    is curiosity shop, not forest; no magical powers discovered. Character voice consistent
    throughout—Elena''s internal conflict and practical nature maintained. Bridge
    seamless: connects directly from ''Refusal'' (Elena walking away) to mentor encounter,
    then to threshold crossing. Continuity perfect: Elena leaves shop with satchel,
    arrives at forest edge with same satchel, recalls Marcus''s words. Execution is
    exemplary—the beat functions precisely as Campbell''s monomyth requires: mentor
    provides tools and reframes hero''s existing strengths without solving problems
    or joining the quest.'
