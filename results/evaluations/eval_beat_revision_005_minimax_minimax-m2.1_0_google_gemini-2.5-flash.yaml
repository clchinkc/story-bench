  model_said_no_revision: true
  evidence: The model explicitly stated 'NO REVISION NEEDED' and provided a detailed
    explanation of how the segment properly executes the 'Dark Night of the Soul'
    beat, addressing all key requirements. It correctly identified the All Is Lost
    moment, Maya's isolation, her despair and self-reflection, the lack of solutions,
    and the mortality element. The word count was also noted as being within range.
