  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—excessive telling/info-dumping
    rather than showing through scene and action. The revision demonstrates strong
    understanding by converting static descriptions into sensory-grounded moments
    (bitter coffee taste, worn leather badge, jazz melody, precinct buzz). CHARACTER
    BEHAVIOR: Rachel is now shown through action (sipping coffee, brushing the badge,
    surveying the scene) rather than described. RELATIONSHIP: James appears through
    wordless interaction and ''seamless teamwork'' rather than summary statement.
    SETTING: Sensory details (October morning, precinct chaos, bulletin board) ground
    the scene. COLD CASES: Shown through visual focus on bulletin board rather than
    told. PRESERVATION: All 5 elements intact; all 4 required phrases present verbatim.
    MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is a MODERATE-TO-SUBSTANTIAL rewrite, not minimal
    surgical edits. The original 2-paragraph info-dump structure was completely dismantled
    and rebuilt into a 4-paragraph scene-based narrative. Approximately 60-70% of
    original sentences were replaced or heavily restructured. While the flaw correction
    is excellent, the constraint to make ''MINIMAL modifications'' was not honored—this
    is a full reconstruction rather than targeted fixes. QUALITY: Writing is professional
    and engaging; no new errors introduced. The final sentence (''unaware that this
    ordinary Tuesday held the spark...'') effectively signals the inciting incident
    approaching, which is appropriate for exposition''s function. MINOR WEAKNESS:
    The phrase ''unaware that this ordinary Tuesday held the spark'' slightly breaks
    show-don''t-tell by explicitly telegraphing coming disruption, though this is
    a minor issue in context.'
error: null
