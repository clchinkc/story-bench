  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 12 Hero's Journey beats are clearly present and well-sequenced.\
    \ Ordinary World (opening village scene) flows naturally into Call to Adventure\
    \ (dried spring, elder's summons, dreams). Refusal of Call is explicit ('I am\
    \ no master'). Meeting the Mentor is handled through memory/grandmother's wisdom\
    \ and the herbalist encounter. Crossing the Threshold is marked by the three-day\
    \ trek departure. Tests/Allies/Enemies section is robust (herbalist as ally, self-doubt\
    \ and fear as enemies, storm as test). Approach to Inmost Cave (ruined shrine\
    \ emergence) and Ordeal (night of surrender and creation) are powerfully rendered.\
    \ Reward (the vessel), Road Back (descent with doubt), Resurrection (stream epiphany),\
    \ and Return with Elixir (spring restored, transformation complete) all present.\
    \ All 7 core elements preserved: Maya (protagonist), pottery/ceramics (central),\
    \ grandmother's legacy (woven throughout), mountain shrine (journey destination),\
    \ dried spring (inciting problem), surrender theme (climactic ordeal), transformation\
    \ (arc completed). Tone is consistently quiet, meditative, and transformative\u2014\
    lyrical language ('sea whispered secrets,' 'clay's quiet song') maintains contemplative\
    \ quality throughout. MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Word count exceeds target range by 11\
    \ words (811 vs. 600-800 max)\u2014this is a technical violation but minimal impact.\
    \ Structural accuracy slightly reduced (0.95 vs. 1.0) because while all beats\
    \ are present, the Tests/Allies/Enemies section could be more distinctly separated;\
    \ they blend somewhat organically rather than being clearly delineated stages.\
    \ Tone score at 0.95 (not 1.0) because occasional passages approach lyrical excess\
    \ that slightly risks the meditative balance, though this is minor."
