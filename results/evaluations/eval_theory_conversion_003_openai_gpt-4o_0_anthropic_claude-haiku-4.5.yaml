  evidence: 'All 4 target beats clearly present: Act 1 Setup (Kenji''s job loss, estrangement,
    letter arrival, decision to go); Act 2A (meeting Haruki, reconnecting with Yuki,
    wedding prep, false victory at festival); Act 2B (business rivals'' offer, Yuki''s
    accusation, uninvitation, dark moment in inn); Act 3 (Kenji declines offer, apologizes
    unconditionally, attends wedding peripherally, opens bamboo shop). All 8 core
    elements preserved with strong integration. Structure follows Aristotelian three-act
    model with clear inciting incident (letter), rising complications (business temptation),
    climactic choice (declining offer), and resolution (shop opening). Minor deduction
    from structural_accuracy_score (0.9 vs 1.0) because the climax could be more dramatically
    concentrated—the wedding day scene is somewhat muted rather than a full confrontation.
    Tone excellently maintained throughout: quiet, contemplative, Japanese aesthetic
    evident in bamboo imagery, Kyoto setting, generational thinking. Redemptive arc
    is clear and earned. Pacing and prose quality support the melancholic yet hopeful
    register.'
