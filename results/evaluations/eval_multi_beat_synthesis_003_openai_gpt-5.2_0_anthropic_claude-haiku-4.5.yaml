  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - ''Things going according to plan (mostly)'': The plan begins smoothly
    but deteriorates faster than typical heist structure; the ''mostly'' qualifier
    is stretched thin when complications arrive within the first beat rather than
    building tension across beats'
  - 'Beat 1 - ''Introduction of an unexpected complication (minor)'': The complication
    (security sweep, Celeste''s presence) is introduced but feels more than ''minor''—it''s
    a major threat that should belong to Beat 3, disrupting the Fun and Games pacing'
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional Chekhov''s Gun execution: The watertight bulkheads are established
    early (''his favorite detail was the Tsarina''s watertight bulkheads'') and become
    the literal closing walls in Beat 3—textbook setup-to-payoff'
  - 'Masterful tonal escalation: Beat 1 opens with dry wit (''too pale to be honest
    champagne''), Beat 2 shifts to recognition and dread (''Miri''s stomach went cold''),
    Beat 3 becomes gallows humor and genuine peril (''She means caged, right?'')'
  - 'Mentor presence perfectly calibrated: Beat 1 (glimpse of ''silver hair, posture
    like a ruler''), Beat 2 (full reveal and recognition), Beat 3 (active antagonist
    controlling the space)'
  - 'Lina''s character arc across beats: Confident operator → suspicious observer
    → sacrificial choice, creating emotional stakes beyond the heist'
  - 'Context maintenance: Monaco setting, Ocean''s Eleven tone, art history reverence,
    and Miri''s characterization (meticulous, dry wit, wronged conservator) all sustained
    throughout'
  - 'Dialogue and banter: Clever, character-specific exchanges (''Tell that to my
    trousers,'' ''It''s a painting, not a baguette'') maintain promised tone'
  - 'False victory clearly marked: Painting secured, then immediately undermined by
    Celeste''s intervention and system lockdown'
  - 'Stakes escalation: Personal (mentor recognition) + operational (system compromise)
    + physical (bulkheads closing) + emotional (Lina captured)'
  weaknesses:
  - 'Word count violation: 1523 words vs. 700-1000 range (52% over limit). This excess
    dilutes pacing and suggests insufficient editorial discipline'
  - 'Beat 1/Beat 2 boundary blurred: Complications arrive too early; the security
    sweep and Celeste reveal should be more clearly separated to allow Fun and Games
    to breathe'
  - 'Theo''s role underutilized: While present, he lacks the character arc depth that
    Lina demonstrates; his arc is functional rather than emotional'
  - 'Jules'' arc minimal: Introduced with personality (''his favorite detail was...'')
    but doesn''t develop meaningfully across beats; feels like supporting player rather
    than crew member with stakes'
  - 'Cliffhanger ending: While dramatically effective, it leaves Beat 3 incomplete—we
    don''t see the full ''walls closing in'' sequence or Miri''s choice fully resolved,
    making it harder to evaluate if all Beat 3 requirements are truly satisfied'
  calibration_notes: 'This is strong work that executes the Save the Cat framework
    with sophistication. The cross-beat constraints are flawlessly integrated—particularly
    the Chekhov''s Gun and mentor presence arcs. Context and tone are maintained excellently.
    The primary deduction is the word count violation (significant structural issue)
    and the premature escalation that compresses Beat 1''s ''mostly going according
    to plan'' requirement. The cliffhanger ending is narratively effective but creates
    ambiguity about whether all Beat 3 requirements are fully demonstrated. Score
    reflects: exceptional constraint execution (1.0) + strong context/coherence (0.95/0.92)
    offset by word count failure and beat pacing issues, landing at 0.91 overall—solidly
    in ''Good'' territory with minor structural concerns.'
