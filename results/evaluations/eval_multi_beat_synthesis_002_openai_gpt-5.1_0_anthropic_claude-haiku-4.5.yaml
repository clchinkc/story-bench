    chekhov_gun_constraint:
      skill_demonstrated_beat1: Literacy + language code-switching (reading the letter
        upside down, German phrase to clerk)
      becomes_essential_beat3: true
      execution: The hymnbook pages with her memorized notes become the key to finding
        the carriers' ford. Her ability to read and translate the British orders aloud
        proves her credibility to the guards.
      score: 1.0
      notes: "Masterfully integrated. The skill is not just repeated but elevated\u2014\
        from covert reading to public recitation as proof."
    identity_transformation_constraint:
      beat1_perception: Still cautious, servant-like ('lowered eyes,' 'habit'), but
        beginning to choose
      beat2_perception: Realizes capability ('You talk like someone who listens,'
        Kofi's recognition; she bribes the sergeant with confidence)
      beat3_perception: Fully claims role ('I am the paper now, the message carried
        by her own will')
      score: 1.0
      notes: Arc is clear and earned. The progression from 'illusion' to 'weapon'
        to 'message' is psychologically coherent.
    escalating_danger_constraint:
      beat1_threat: Discovery at checkpoint, torn pass, exposure
      beat2_threat: Direct confrontation with sergeant and officers, potential arrest
      beat3_threat: Active pursuit (dog barking, tracker scent), imminent capture,
        guards with muskets
      score: 1.0
      notes: Each beat raises stakes. Beat 1 is avoidable; Beat 2 is confrontational;
        Beat 3 is existential.

      beat1_presence: true
      beat2_presence: true
      beat3_presence: true
      score: 1.0
      notes: 'Literacy and languages function as weapons throughout: reading the letter,
        speaking Hausa/pidgin/English to navigate checkpoints, reciting orders to
        prove credibility, using hymnbook pages to navigate. The theme is woven, not
        stated.'
    context_maintenance:
      protagonist_amara: Fully realized. Her intelligence, courage, and moral complexity
        are evident.
      setting_1890s_gold_coast: Vivid and accurate. Colonial architecture, Hausa constables,
        Basel missionaries, specific geography (Adwuma ford, hunters' grove).
      tone_historical_adventure_anticolonial: Strong. The narrative voice balances
        danger with dignity; resistance is framed as moral necessity, not melodrama.
      score: 0.95
      notes: 'Minor: Could have included slightly more sensory detail of the forest
        itself, but what''s present is evocative.'
    narrative_coherence:
      beat_flow: Smooth transitions. Each beat builds logically from the previous.
      pacing: Excellent. Tension escalates without feeling rushed.
      character_consistency: Amara's voice, choices, and growth are consistent.
      thematic_unity: 'All elements serve the central question: what does it mean
        to be a weapon of knowledge?'
      score: 0.92
      notes: 'Minor: The final paragraph could be slightly tightened. The phrase ''empty
        as their pockets'' is slightly on-the-nose for an otherwise subtle narrative
        voice.'
  strengths:
  - "Exceptional execution of Chekhov's Gun\u2014literacy skills escalate from covert\
    \ to overt and become proof of identity"
  - Identity transformation is earned and psychologically credible across all three
    beats
  - Escalating danger is precise and thematically coherent
  - Dialogue and code-switching feel authentic and serve both plot and characterization
  - "The cut bridge as final obstacle is elegant\u2014it forces Amara to use her knowledge\
    \ to find an alternative path"
  - Thematic thread of 'knowledge as resistance' is woven throughout without didacticism
  - Historical detail is accurate and integrated naturally
  - Amara's agency is never compromised; she chooses her path at every juncture
  weaknesses:
  - "Word count significantly exceeds limit (2333 vs. 1000)\u2014this is a major constraint\
    \ violation"
  - The thematic distinction between 'resistance' and 'survival' in Beat 3 is implicit
    rather than crystallized
  - Final paragraph's closing line ('empty as their pockets') slightly breaks the
    subtle narrative voice
  - Could benefit from one more sensory detail of the forest environment to deepen
    immersion
  calibration_notes: This is a strong narrative that satisfies nearly all requirements
    with sophistication. The word count violation is significant and prevents a higher
    score, but the quality of execution across beats and constraints is exceptional.
    The story demonstrates mastery of character arc, thematic integration, and plot
    mechanics. Score reflects excellence in craft offset by a clear technical failure
    (word count).
