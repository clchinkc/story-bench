  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the 'telling vs. showing'
    flaw in the exposition. It transformed summary into a scene, showing Rachel's
    dedication to cold cases, her interaction with James, and her home life with Sherlock.
    The changes were significant enough to create a scene, moving beyond 'minimal
    surgical edits' but not a complete rewrite of the core information.
