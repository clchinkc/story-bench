  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The Ordeal
    as a mere boss battle and not a transformative crisis. It successfully introduced
    Kira's deepest fear (guilt over her brother's death) through the dragon's dialogue,
    created a 'death' moment where she gives up and accepts her perceived failure,
    and then showed a rebirth/transformation where she gains new understanding and
    fights with renewed purpose. The victory comes from this internal shift, not just
    persistence. The changes were surgical, focusing on the internal conflict and
    its resolution, while largely preserving the original action beats. One required
    phrase was slightly altered ('a earth-shaking roar' became 'an earth-shaking roar').
