  - 'Beat 1: Introduction of an unexpected complication (minor) - The complication
    (Claire''s involvement) is major, not minor, and immediately shifts the tone and
    stakes significantly.'
  - 'Beat 2: False victory: a key objective achieved - While Miri gets the painting,
    the immediate revelation of Claire and Sorokin''s presence makes it feel less
    like a ''false victory'' and more like a direct confrontation. The ''victory''
    is immediately overshadowed by the new threat, rather than being a moment of perceived
    success that then unravels.'
