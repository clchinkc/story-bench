  evidence: The model correctly identified that the flaw was Sophie's lack of change
    upon returning. It addressed this by showing her responding differently to work
    stress, having a lighter tone, and envisioning a fresh perspective. It also included
    her mother noticing something different implicitly through the lighter tone and
    Sophie's new priorities. The changes were relatively minimal, focusing on altering
    Sophie's internal monologue and immediate actions regarding work. The phrase "It's
    good to be home," she said" was changed to "It's good to be home," she said, a
    smile creeping onto her face." which is a slight deviation from exact preservation.
