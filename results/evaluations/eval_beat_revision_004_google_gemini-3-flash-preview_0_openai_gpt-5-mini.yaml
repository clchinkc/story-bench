  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw (telling exposition) by converting
    the info-dump into a lived scene: sensory detail (jazz, steam from coffee, autumn
    air), characteristic behavior (studying a 1998 photograph, noting a forensics
    discrepancy), and a shown partnership via workplace interaction and dialogue with
    Detective James Oyelaran. The cat appears naturally (Sherlock, described as a
    tabby scratching the desk). This fixes the core problems (show vs tell, sensory
    grounding, showing relationships) though a small telling line remains (''they
    were the reason their clearance rate...''). Required-preserved phrase check: ''Detective
    James Oyelaran'' and ''Tuesday morning in October'' appear exactly/near-exactly;
    ''cat named Sherlock'' is implied clearly though not as that exact phrase; ''Detective
    Rachel Torres'' appears as ''Rachel Torres'' (title omitted). Changes were substantive
    (scene created) rather than surgical edits, hence a low minimal_change_score.'
