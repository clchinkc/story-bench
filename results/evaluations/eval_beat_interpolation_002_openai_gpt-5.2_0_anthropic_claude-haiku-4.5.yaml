  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Recanting
    considered explicitly (''simplest lever to pull''). (2) Official channels thoroughly
    explored through Morrison/task force option. (3) Internal conflict powerfully
    rendered (''either way, staying inside the lines makes me predictable''). (4)
    Marcus conversation serves as tipping point toward third option. Beat authentically
    executes the Debate function—Sarah wrestles with genuine dilemmas, weighs consequences,
    seeks counsel, and reaches a decision through internal struggle rather than external
    force. Character voice is consistent, sharp, and introspective. VIOLATIONS: (1)
    Word count 455 exceeds 400-word maximum by 55 words (deduction -0.25). (2) CRITICAL:
    The ''AFTER'' section violates ''must_not'' requirement #1—Sarah has already decided
    to go rogue and resigned before the Debate beat concludes. The resignation letter
    and ''former detective, current vigilante'' language indicate the decision is
    already made, which skips the debate''s narrative function in the final section
    (deduction -0.5). The GENERATED section itself executes Debate perfectly, but
    the AFTER section contamination suggests the beat boundary is unclear. BRIDGE:
    Strong connection between Debate and Break Into Two, though the resignation should
    occur at the threshold, not before. CONTINUITY: Minor issue—the laptop files mentioned
    in AFTER weren''t explicitly copied during GENERATED section, though this is a
    minor gap.'
