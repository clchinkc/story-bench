  evidence: The revision explicitly addresses the actual flaw by having the dragon
    exploit Kira's guilt over her brother (confrontation with deepest fear), giving
    her a symbolic 'death' moment (she surrenders/dangles and accepts she cannot rewrite
    the past), and depicting a rebirth/transformation (the insight about her brother's
    lesson leads to a new clarity). Victory arises from that new understanding (she
    notices the seam and exploits it), not mere persistence. The required phrases
    and core elements were preserved verbatim or nearly so. Changes were substantive
    but targeted—added interiority and a brief symbolic death/rebirth while keeping
    setting, major lines, and outcome—hence a moderately high minimal-change score
    rather than a perfect 1.0.
