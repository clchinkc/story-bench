  evidence: The model correctly identified the 'telling not showing' flaw in the original
    exposition. It transformed summary into a lived scene, revealing Rachel's character,
    her relationship with James, and her dedication to cold cases through action,
    dialogue, and sensory details. The changes were extensive, essentially a rewrite,
    but necessary to fix the fundamental flaw of 'telling' vs 'showing'. All required
    elements and phrases were preserved.
