  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Thomas directly examines Dr.
    Okonkwo, there is a clear moment of near-recant, Thomas takes decisive (rule-breaking)
    action that influences her, and her testimony becomes the turning point. The climax
    executes its narrative function effectively and avoids all listed must-not items.
    Minor deductions: a small realism/continuity quibble— the judge sustains the objection
    yet Thomas continues, which strains courtroom procedure and slightly affects character/continuity
    realism; otherwise character behavior and the bridge to falling action are strong.'
