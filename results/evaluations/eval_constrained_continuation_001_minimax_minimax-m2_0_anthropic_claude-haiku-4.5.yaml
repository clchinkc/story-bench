  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - "Approach to the Inmost Cave: The passage through trapped tunnels, the circular\
      \ chamber with symbols, the rising ink\u2014all represent approaching the Library's\
      \ threshold"
    - 'The Ordeal: The black tide/knowledge-thralls sequence where Zara must choose
      between escape and confrontation, experiencing symbolic death and rebirth through
      the ink'
    must_include_detail:
    - "Choice between safety and helping: Zara tells Tom\xE1s to run while she faces\
      \ the ink\u2014explicit sacrifice decision"
    - 'Trap requiring thief skills: Pressure plate detection, reading worn stones,
      finding safe path through trapped section'
    - "Tom\xE1s's true motivation revealed: His brother died in Guild experiments;\
      \ he used Zara instrumentally to reach the Library"
    - "Confronting fear of failure: 'If I don't face this, I fail everyone who needs\
      \ that cure'\u2014explicitly addresses stakes beyond physical danger"
    - 'Symbolic death/rebirth: Drowning in the ink, memories fraying, old self dissolving,
      then emerging changed with new understanding'
    - "Zara emerges changed: 'She was no longer just a thief. She was something more\
      \ dangerous'\u2014transformed by the Ordeal with new knowledge and perception"
    must_not_detail:
    - "Cure not found: \u2713 Zara passes through but doesn't obtain the cure"
    - "No romantic subplot: \u2713 Relationship remains transactional and morally\
      \ complex"
    - "Tom\xE1s survives: \u2713 He escapes with the map; no death occurs"
    - "No supernatural abilities for Zara: \u2713 Her changes are psychological/perceptual,\
      \ not magical powers"
    tone_assessment: "Excellent execution of tense, morally complex atmosphere. Desperation\
      \ is palpable (trap sequence, ink confrontation). Moral complexity shines through\
      \ Tom\xE1s's revelation and Zara's sacrifice. Moments of desperate hope present\
      \ ('shadows aren't just about hiding'). Minor deduction only for slight melodrama\
      \ in 'breaking bones' sound effect."
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect alignment with requirements. Zara has passed through
      the Ordeal (emerged from ink changed). New complication introduced: Scorpion
      Guild sentries waiting ahead. Creates tension for next phase while maintaining
      the journey''s momentum.'
    strengths:
    - All required story beats seamlessly integrated
    - Exceptional character development through action
    - "Morally nuanced portrayal of Tom\xE1s (neither villain nor pure ally)"
    - Symbolic language (shadows, ink, drowning) enhances thematic depth
    - Cliffhanger ending maintains narrative momentum
    weaknesses:
    - Word count violation (47 words over limit) is the only constraint failure
    - Could trim approximately 50 words without losing narrative impact
