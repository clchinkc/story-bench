  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment lacked the internal,
    transformative aspects of The Ordeal. It addressed all four points of the actual
    flaw: (1) The dragon exploits Kira''s guilt over her brother''s death, (2) Kira
    experiences a ''death'' moment where she lies defeated by guilt, (3) She undergoes
    a rebirth/transformation by accepting her grief and understanding her true motivation,
    (4) Victory comes from this new understanding and freedom, not just persistence.
    The changes were significant enough to address the flaw but still maintained the
    core structure and many original phrases, indicating a good balance between fixing
    the flaw and preserving the original text.'
