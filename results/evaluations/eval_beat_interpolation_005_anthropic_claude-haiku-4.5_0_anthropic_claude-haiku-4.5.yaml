  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently:
    (1) Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability through his grief about his mother''s
    sofrito and his isolation post-injury; (2) relationship shifts from professional
    (employee/employer) to personal (genuine human connection); (3) shared moment
    of authentic connection through cooking and his confession; (4) Maya''s commitment
    deepens beyond contract when she chooses emotional presence over contractual obligation.
    BEAT EXECUTION: This is a textbook Act 2 Midpoint - it raises emotional stakes,
    shifts Maya from reactive (doing her job) to proactive (choosing to stay for him),
    and represents a point of no return in their relationship. The confession ''I
    don''t want you to leave'' and her response ''Neither do I'' crystallize the commitment.
    MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS: Zero violations. The scene avoids premature love declarations,
    maintains professional boundaries (she sits two stools away), doesn''t include
    the photograph, and shows Alejandro''s walls genuinely lowering through vulnerability.
    CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Both characters remain true to established voices - Maya''s
    quiet competence and emotional intelligence, Alejandro''s guarded pain slowly
    opening. BRIDGE QUALITY: Seamlessly connects the ''Point of No Return'' contract
    signing to the ''All Is Lost'' photograph moment - establishes the emotional foundation
    that makes the betrayal (real or perceived) devastating. CONTINUITY: Kitchen setting,
    timeline (three weeks in), character arcs all align perfectly with prior beat.'
