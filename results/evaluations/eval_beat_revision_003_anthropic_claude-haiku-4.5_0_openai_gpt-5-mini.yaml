  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw (Sophie showed no lasting change)
    by adding concrete, minimal beats that demonstrate transformation: she pauses,
    places the phone face-down (physical marker), reframes the emergencies (''Linda
    will survive one more night''), and explicitly applies an insight from the retreat
    (''noticing a thought rather than living it'' / ''didn''t have to let the chaos
    define her anymore''). The mother notices (a surprised glance), and there''s a
    clear contrast between Sophie’s old automatic panic and her new measured response.
    Changes were surgical—key lines and structure were preserved and a few targeted
    sentences were inserted to show integration of the journey.'
