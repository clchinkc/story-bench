  evidence: "All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly delineated: (1) You\u2014\
    library comfort zone established with vivid sensory detail; (2) Need\u2014lack\
    \ of voice/connection implied through mother's concern and Zoe's self-awareness;\
    \ (3) Go\u2014Ms. Okafor's program and Bernard interview initiate departure; (4)\
    \ Search\u2014five interviews showing iterative learning, voice cracking, hands\
    \ steadying; (5) Find\u2014Bernard's confession about the firefight and 'You asked\
    \ the right questions'; (6) Take\u2014town hall presentation where Zoe speaks\
    \ publicly despite fear; (7) Return\u2014visiting Bernard through October, attending\
    \ funeral, ordinary life resumes; (8) Change\u2014journalism school application,\
    \ walking into unknown with recorder, demonstrating internal transformation. All\
    \ 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history\
    \ program, Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key relationship), social\
    \ anxiety (stutters, rehearsing, pulse thrashing), town hall presentation, Bernard's\
    \ death, journalism ending. Tone is consistently gentle and intimate\u2014introspective\
    \ yet warm, with emotionally true moments (Bernard's watery smile, the bridge\
    \ metaphor, 'her own' final line). Minor deduction from perfect scores: structural_accuracy\
    \ slightly reduced (0.95) because the Return beat could be more explicitly marked\
    \ as distinct from Take; tone slightly reduced (0.95) because one or two moments\
    \ approach sentimentality rather than restraint, though this is minimal. Conversion\
    \ successfully transforms monomyth's external hero's journey into Story Circle's\
    \ internal psychological arc."
