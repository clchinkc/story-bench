  evidence: The story successfully maps the original three-act structure into Freytag's
    five stages. Exposition clearly sets up Samira's world and the initial impossible
    virus. Rising Action details the escalating investigation and the discovery of
    Nexus's involvement. The Climax is well-defined by the confrontation with Nexus
    and Samira's decision to go public. Falling Action covers the immediate aftermath
    of the press conference and the cure's distribution. Denouement provides a clear
    resolution for Samira and the broader conflict. All six core elements are preserved.
    The word count is outside the specified range (820 words vs. 500-700). Structural
    accuracy is good, but the Climax feels a little stretched, encompassing both the
    decision to go public and the press conference itself, which could arguably be
    split between Climax and Falling Action, but it works within the narrative flow.
    The tone is perfectly maintained, delivering a compelling medical thriller with
    ethical depth.
