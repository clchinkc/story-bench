  evidence: "The revision correctly targeted the All Is Lost flaw by removing remaining\
    \ obvious options and support: the board cuts off fundraising and offers Denise\
    \ the director job (betrayal/isolation), the grant is explicitly denied, the city\
    \ rezoned the property and other buildings were bought by the developer (no path\
    \ forward), and a separate legal loss threatens his home and family (personal\
    \ loss/whiff of death). Marcus is depicted as defeated and utterly alone. All\
    \ four required elements (Marcus protagonist, community center/youth program setting,\
    \ eviction crisis, Denise present) remain intact and all four required phrases\
    \ appear verbatim or nearly so. Changes were more than surgical \u2014 new plot\
    \ details and emotional beats were added across several sentences \u2014 so I\
    \ rated minimal_change as moderate (0.5). Writing quality is strong with coherent,\
    \ bleak tone appropriate to the beat."
