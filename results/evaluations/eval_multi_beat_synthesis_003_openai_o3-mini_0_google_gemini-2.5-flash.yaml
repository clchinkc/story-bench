  - 'Beat 1: Things going according to plan (mostly) - The ''peculiar glitch'' and
    ''unexpected gout of static'' suggest things are not going mostly to plan, but
    rather a significant early complication.'
  - 'Beat 3: Miri must choose: painting or revenge/saving someone - While Miri considers
    saving Jasper, the choice isn''t explicitly framed as ''painting or saving someone''
    but rather how to use the exit route to save Jasper while still securing the painting.
    The ''revenge'' aspect isn''t a direct choice here.'
