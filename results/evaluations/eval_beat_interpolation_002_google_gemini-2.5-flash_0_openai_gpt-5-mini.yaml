  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Sarah considers recanting, considers
    going to authorities, displays clear internal duty-vs-sister conflict, and a conversation/moment
    (with Marcus and her internal realization) tips toward a third option. No prohibited
    items appear (no immediate rogue decision, no one else makes the choice, no prior
    resignation, no direct confrontation). Character behavior and setting remain consistent
    and the scene cleanly sets up the Break into Two.'
