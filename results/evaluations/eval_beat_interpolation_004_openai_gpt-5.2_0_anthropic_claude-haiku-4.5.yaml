  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently.\
    \ (1) Direct examination of Dr. Okonkwo with specific questions about her position\
    \ and Exhibit 38. (2) Clear near-recant moment: 'I don't,' she said, too quickly'\
    \ and her denial of prior statements, with the gallery sensing the case collapsing.\
    \ (3) Thomas takes decisive action by approaching sidebar to expose coercion,\
    \ then directly confronting her with empathetic pressure ('look at me...you will\
    \ not be alone'), which influences her decision. (4) Turning point clearly marked:\
    \ her admission 'Yes...I wrote them. And I watched them get buried' with the metaphor\
    \ 'landed like a gavel.' All must-not items avoided: she struggles internally\
    \ before truth-telling, Thomas actively influences outcome rather than remaining\
    \ passive, defense doesn't win, no deus ex machina. Character voice is consistent\u2014\
    Thomas shows his father's influence while forging his own path; Dr. Okonkwo's\
    \ fear and moral conflict ring true. Bridge to Falling Action is seamless: verdict\
    \ follows logically, emotional hollowness contrasts with legal victory, Dr. Okonkwo's\
    \ continued struggle is set up. Setting continuity perfect: courtroom \u2192 hallway\
    \ \u2192 father's appearance maintains spatial logic. DEDUCTION: Word count exceeds\
    \ range by 96 words (546 vs. 300-450 max), which is a technical violation but\
    \ doesn't impair narrative quality or beat execution. This is a minor structural\
    \ issue that prevents perfect score."
