  evidence: Mentor Marcus is introduced and provides practical tools and guidance
    (satchel, compass, advice). Elena's doubt shifts toward reluctant acceptance (fastening
    the satchel, 'Maybe that counted.'). Her librarian skills are explicitly referenced
    as useful. No forbidden elements appear (she does not become immediately confident,
    Marcus refuses to accompany or solve her problems, she is not in the forest here,
    and no newfound magic is revealed). Continuity and character voice are consistent,
    and the scene bridges refusal and the forthcoming threshold effectively.
