  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true ''All Is Lost'' moment. It addressed all aspects of the flaw: the fundraiser
    failed, the grant was denied, the board dissolved (removing a support system),
    Denise left (personal loss/betrayal), his wife filed for divorce (major personal
    loss/betrayal), and Marcus explicitly states ''No answer. No plan. No hope to
    offer.'' The ''whiff of death'' is present in the metaphorical death of his purpose
    and identity, and the literal loss of his marriage and support system. The changes
    were significant to achieve the ''All Is Lost'' beat, but they built upon the
    original premise and characters, rather than a complete rewrite. The writing quality
    is excellent, effectively conveying the despair.'
