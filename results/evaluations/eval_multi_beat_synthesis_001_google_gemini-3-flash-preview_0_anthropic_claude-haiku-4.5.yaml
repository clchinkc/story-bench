  detailed_breakdown:
    beat_1_tests_allies_enemies:
      score: 0.95
      satisfied:
      - Kael introduced as distrustful Resonant ally - 'You look like a ghost, Reyes'
      - Test of ability under pressure - Dante uses white charcoal to reveal Silas's
        betrayal
      - Enemy revelation - Silas revealed as traitor handing key to shadow figure
      - Dante proves himself - Kael's static dies, replaced by 'grim, respectful silence'
      - Addiction/recovery referenced - track marks visible, 'three years ago' established,
        Dante's clean status questioned
      notes: All five requirements fully satisfied with strong character work and
        world-building
    beat_2_approach_inmost_cave:
      score: 0.95
      satisfied:
      - Planning scene - Dante and Kael map descent in sub-basement, strategic preparation
      - Guilt recognition as obstacle - Kael warns about Siphon exploiting 'what-ifs'
        and emotional anchors
      - Preparation scene - tools laid out (charcoal, silver paint, Elena's photo),
        ritualistic hand-coating
      - Moment of doubt/fear - 'paralyzing fear gripped him,' vacuum of emotion triggers
        relapse fear
      - Symbolic threshold - rusted iron door, crossing into 'the center of his own
        wreckage'
      notes: Excellent escalation and psychological depth. Threshold is both physical
        and emotional.
    beat_3_the_ordeal:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied:
      - Direct confrontation - Siphon appears as 'towering, shifting mass of stolen
        hues'
      - Symbolic death - Dante transported to Elena's death scene, black sludge rising,
        vision going gray
      - All seems lost - Kael screaming, Dante's spirit dissolving, 'irresistible
        siren song' of surrender
      - Transformation through acceptance - Dante declares 'I am a thief, a liar,
        and a failure' and accepts it
      - Victory through understanding - white charcoal grounds Siphon to 'reality
        of Dante's absolute truth,' monster cannot digest accepted brokenness
      notes: 'Slight deduction: victory mechanism is somewhat abstract (how does acceptance
        physically defeat the Siphon?), but thematically powerful and consistent with
        noir-fantasy tone'
    chekhov_gun:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      details: White charcoal introduced in Beat 1 as tool to reveal truth, becomes
        essential in Beat 3 as the weapon that defeats Siphon by grounding it to reality.
        Perfect payoff.
    character_arc_progression:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      beat_1: Guilt mentioned - track marks, sister's death referenced implicitly
      beat_2: Guilt recognized as tactical weakness - Kael warns it will be weaponized
        against him
      beat_3: Guilt transformed - Dante accepts it as foundation rather than cage,
        defeats monster through acceptance
    rising_stakes:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      progression: 'Beat 1: Distrust, revelation of traitor (community level) → Beat
        2: Personal fear of relapse, approaching killer''s lair (psychological + physical)
        → Beat 3: Symbolic death, all seems lost, existential threat (life/death +
        spiritual)'
    ally_continuity:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      beat_1: Kael introduced, gains respect for Dante
      beat_2: Kael present, planning together, warns about Siphon's tactics
      beat_3: Kael present in confrontation, her kinetic energy being drained, stakes
        tied to her survival
    context_maintenance:
      protagonist: Dante Reyes fully realized - recovering addict, guilt about Elena,
        emotional residue vision ability
      setting: Buckingham Hotel as nexus maintained throughout, sub-basement descent,
        boiler room climax
      tone: Noir-tinged urban fantasy perfectly sustained - melancholic language,
        gritty details, determined redemption arc
      hidden_world: Resonants and their abilities well-integrated (Vibrationist Kael,
        Clarification infusion, Hollow pocket dimension)
    narrative_coherence:
      flow: Excellent progression from introduction to ally to planning to confrontation
      pacing: Well-balanced across three beats despite word count constraint
      thematic_unity: Guilt as both obstacle and solution creates elegant narrative
        symmetry
      minor_issue: Transition from Beat 2 to Beat 3 is abrupt (no explicit 'crossing'
        moment shown), though thematically justified
  strengths:
  - Masterful integration of Campbell's monomyth stages with noir-fantasy tone
  - Dante's character arc is psychologically complex and earned
  - White charcoal serves as perfect Chekhov's Gun - introduced casually, becomes
    thematic resolution
  - Guilt transformation is the true victory, not physical defeat - sophisticated
    thematic work
  - Kael is a compelling ally with agency and skepticism
  - Sensory language is vivid and emotionally resonant throughout
  - All cross-beat constraints perfectly satisfied
  weaknesses:
  - Word count exceeds limit by 59 words (minor technical issue)
  - Siphon's defeat mechanism could be more explicitly shown (how does acceptance
    physically ground the monster?)
  - Transition between Beat 2 and Beat 3 lacks explicit threshold-crossing action
  - Elena's presence is strong but could have one more direct moment in Beat 2 to
    deepen the obstacle
  calibration_notes: This is exceptional work that fully satisfies the theoretical
    framework while maintaining strong narrative quality. The only technical failure
    is word count overage. The story demonstrates sophisticated understanding of Campbell's
    monomyth and executes a redemption arc with genuine emotional weight. The thematic
    victory (acceptance over strength) is particularly well-executed for the noir-fantasy
    genre.
