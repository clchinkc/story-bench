  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the flaw: the original segment lacked true\
    \ 'All Is Lost' devastation because Marcus retained multiple viable options (fundraiser,\
    \ grant, new location) and intact support systems. The revision systematically\
    \ eliminates all escape routes: (1) fundraiser explicitly failed with major donor\
    \ pullout, (2) grant rejected, (3) personal financial crisis (mortgage payment\
    \ failed), (4) Denise betrays/abandons him for city job, (5) metaphorical death\
    \ of identity ('He had nothing. He was nothing.'). All four required phrases preserved\
    \ verbatim: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands,' 'Thirty days\
    \ to vacate the community center,' '\"There has to be something we can do,\" said\
    \ Denise,' and 'He rubbed his temples.' All four story elements preserved: Marcus\
    \ as protagonist, community center setting, eviction crisis, Denise present throughout.\
    \ Changes were surgical rather than wholesale\u2014the revision maintains the\
    \ original opening dialogue structure while adding specific rejections, financial\
    \ failure, and Denise's departure. The emotional arc shifts from 'setback with\
    \ hope' to genuine rock bottom. Writing quality is strong with effective use of\
    \ sensory detail ('color drain from her face,' 'quiet, final rustle,' 'absolute,\
    \ physical weight'). The 'whiff of death' is powerfully executed through both\
    \ literal loss (Denise leaving, funds depleted) and metaphorical death (identity\
    \ stripped away). Minor: could argue the ending is slightly more literary/poetic\
    \ than the original's tone, but this enhances rather than detracts from beat execution."
