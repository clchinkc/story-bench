  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' for exposition. It completely rewrote the segment to demonstrate
    Rachel's traits, her relationship with James, and the setting through action,
    dialogue, and sensory details. The changes were not minimal, as it was a complete
    rewrite, but this was necessary to fix the fundamental flaw of 'telling' vs 'showing'
    in exposition.
