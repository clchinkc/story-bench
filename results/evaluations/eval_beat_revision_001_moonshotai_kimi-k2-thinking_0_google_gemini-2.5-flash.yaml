  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The Ordeal
    as a mere boss battle and not a transformative crisis. It introduced Kira's guilt
    as the core fear, created a 'death' moment where she drops her sword in surrender,
    and showed her transformation through acceptance leading to a new understanding
    of victory. The changes were significant enough to fix the flaw but retained much
    of the original setup. One required phrase was slightly altered ('The Shadow Dragon
    collapsed with a earth-shaking roar' vs 'The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking
    roar').
