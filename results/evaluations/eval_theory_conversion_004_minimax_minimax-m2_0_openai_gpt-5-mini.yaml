  evidence: 'All eight Harmon beats are present and in the correct sequence. All eight
    required elements (Zoe, library/program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard, Zoe''s social anxiety,
    town-hall, Bernard''s death, journalism application) are preserved. Minor deductions:
    the ''Take'' beat (paying the price) functions as accepting responsibility via
    the town-hall presentation but lacks a clearer sense of sacrifice or concrete
    cost; the narrative sometimes summarizes developments (e.g., progress across interviews,
    program end) rather than dramatizing the struggle in more detail, so I reduced
    structural_accuracy slightly. Tone remains gentle and intimate with only very
    small loss where events are compacted, hence a small deduction from perfect.'
