  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Thomas directly examines Dr.
    Okonkwo; there is a clear near-recant when she hesitates and attempts to deflect;
    Thomas takes decisive, unconventional action (physically and verbally) that influences
    her decision; the turning point is explicit when she admits the reports. No prohibited
    items appear (no passive Thomas, no deus ex machina, defense does not win). Character
    behavior and setting are consistent with the surrounding beats.'
