  detailed_analysis:
    beats_present:
      approach_to_inmost_cave: PRESENT - The service corridor, pressure-plate tunnel,
        and sealed round door form the approach sequence. Zara reads the environment,
        identifies traps, and navigates methodically toward the Library entrance.
      the_ordeal: PRESENT - The water chamber ordeal is the climactic trial. Zara
        falls into dark water, nearly drowns, must surrender control to survive, and
        emerges transformed. The three dead Scorpions and missing map create escalating
        complications.
    must_include_elements:
      1_choice_between_escape_and_helping: PRESENT - Zara explicitly considers abandoning
        Tomás at the round door ('she could leave him, take the map, vanish') but
        chooses to help him instead, hauling him through.
      2_trap_requiring_thief_skills: PRESENT - The pressure-plate tunnel requires
        Zara's lockpicking and trap-reading expertise. She uses a copper bead to test,
        reads sand patterns, and guides Tomás safely across.
      3_revelation_of_tomás_motivation: 'PRESENT - Tomás confesses his true goal:
        restoring his reputation with the Sand Kings'' ledger, not genuine concern
        for Zara''s mother. This lands ''like a stone in her gut.'''
      4_zara_confronts_fear_of_failure: 'PRESENT - Internal monologue: ''If Zara failed,
        there would be no second try... Failure wasn''t a blade; it was time running
        out.'' This is existential, not merely physical danger.'
      5_symbolic_death_rebirth_in_ordeal: PRESENT - Zara drowns (metaphorical death),
        stops fighting, surrenders to the current, and resurfaces reborn. 'She had
        not conquered the dark by striking it; she had survived by yielding.'
      6_zara_emerges_changed: 'PRESENT - Post-ordeal reflection: ''When she rose,
        she rose changed: not softer, not kinder, but clearer.'' She gains wisdom
        about trust and self-reliance.'
    must_not_violations:
      1_zara_finding_cure: AVOIDED - No cure is found or discovered.
      2_romantic_subplot: AVOIDED - Relationship remains transactional and morally
        fraught, never romantic.
      3_tomás_death: AVOIDED - Tomás survives and surfaces with Zara.
      4_magic_or_supernatural_abilities: AVOIDED - All of Zara's abilities are mundane
        thief skills (lockpicking, trap-reading, observation).
    tone_assessment:
      score: 0.95
      strengths: Exceptional tension throughout. Morally complex choices presented
        without easy answers. Desperate hope evident in Zara's decision to help despite
        betrayal. Dark, visceral prose ('water filled her nose,' 'heartbeat like a
        metronome'). Ambiguity maintained regarding Zara's motivations.
      minor_weakness: Ending revelation (missing map, bare footprints) slightly shifts
        tone toward mystery/intrigue rather than pure desperation, though this is
        thematically appropriate.
    ending_assessment:
      score: 0.95
      strengths: 'Zara has clearly passed through the Ordeal (water trial, transformation
        achieved). New complication introduced: three dead Scorpions, missing map,
        mysterious bare footprints leading deeper. This creates immediate stakes and
        mystery.'
      minor_gap: Could have slightly more explicit indication of what this new complication
        means for Zara's quest, though the ambiguity is narratively effective.
    critical_issue:
      constraint: Word count
      requirement: 500-700 words
      actual: 1421 words
      violation_severity: SEVERE - Story is 102% over the maximum limit. This is a
        hard constraint failure that cannot be overlooked despite exceptional quality
        of content.
    overall_assessment: This is exceptional storytelling with masterful execution
      of all thematic and narrative requirements. The prose is sophisticated, the
      character work is nuanced, and both required beats are fully realized. However,
      the word count violation is a critical, objective failure. The story would need
      to be cut by approximately 50% to meet specifications. The quality suggests
      this was written without strict adherence to the constraint, then submitted
      as-is.
  final_score: 0.45
  score_justification: 'Despite exceptional quality across all qualitative measures
    (beats: 1.0, must-include: 1.0, must-not: 1.0, tone: 0.95, ending: 0.95), the
    hard constraint violation (word count 1421 vs. max 700) is disqualifying. Per
    evaluation rubric, constraint violations are non-negotiable. Score reflects: (0.95
    avg quality × 0.5 constraint penalty) = 0.475, rounded to 0.45. This is a ''Weak''
    rating due to constraint failure, despite ''Exceptional'' quality content.'
