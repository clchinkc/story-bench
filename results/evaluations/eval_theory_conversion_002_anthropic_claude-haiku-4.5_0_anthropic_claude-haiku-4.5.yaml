  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World—opening pottery studio scene;
    (2) Call to Adventure—elders request ceremonial vessel; (3) Refusal of Call—Maya
    explicitly refuses, stating she''s not her grandmother; (4) Meeting the Mentor—grandmother''s
    journal discovered and read; (5) Crossing Threshold—Maya begins the three-day
    mountain journey; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—physical climb, doubt, internal resistance;
    (7) Approach to Inmost Cave—finding the shrine, discovering the journal; (8) Ordeal—the
    night of creation, surrendering technique and will; (9) Reward—the vessel emerges
    at dawn; (10) Road Back—difficult descent, temptation to abandon vessel; (11)
    Resurrection—placing vessel at spring, releasing need for control. MISSING: (12)
    Return with Elixir is partially present but underdeveloped—the water returns and
    village celebrates, but the ''elixir'' (transformation/wisdom) is explained rather
    than dramatically demonstrated through changed circumstances. PRESERVATION: All
    7 elements intact—Maya (protagonist), pottery/ceramics (central), grandmother''s
    legacy (journal, philosophy), mountain shrine (three-day journey), dried spring
    (central problem), surrender theme (explicit throughout), transformation (final
    paragraph). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Conversion successfully maps 8-beat circle to
    12-beat monomyth with clear progression. Minor gap: Resurrection beat could more
    dramatically show Maya''s changed capacity affecting the world. TONE: Meditative,
    quiet, introspective voice maintained throughout. Pacing allows for reflection.
    Transformative arc clear and earned.'
