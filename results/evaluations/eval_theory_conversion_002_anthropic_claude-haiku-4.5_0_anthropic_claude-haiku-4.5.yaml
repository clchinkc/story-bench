  evidence: "BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World\u2014opening pottery studio\
    \ scene; (2) Call to Adventure\u2014elders request ceremonial vessel; (3) Refusal\
    \ of Call\u2014Maya explicitly refuses, stating she's not her grandmother; (4)\
    \ Meeting the Mentor\u2014grandmother's journal discovered and read; (5) Crossing\
    \ Threshold\u2014Maya begins the three-day mountain journey; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies\u2014\
    physical climb, doubt, internal resistance; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave\u2014\
    finding the shrine, discovering the journal; (8) Ordeal\u2014the night of creation,\
    \ surrendering technique and will; (9) Reward\u2014the vessel emerges at dawn;\
    \ (10) Road Back\u2014difficult descent, temptation to abandon vessel; (11) Resurrection\u2014\
    placing vessel at spring, releasing need for control. MISSING: (12) Return with\
    \ Elixir is partially present but underdeveloped\u2014the water returns and village\
    \ celebrates, but the 'elixir' (transformation/wisdom) is explained rather than\
    \ dramatically demonstrated through changed circumstances. PRESERVATION: All 7\
    \ elements intact\u2014Maya (protagonist), pottery/ceramics (central), grandmother's\
    \ legacy (journal, philosophy), mountain shrine (three-day journey), dried spring\
    \ (central problem), surrender theme (explicit throughout), transformation (final\
    \ paragraph). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Conversion successfully maps 8-beat circle\
    \ to 12-beat monomyth with clear progression. Minor gap: Resurrection beat could\
    \ more dramatically show Maya's changed capacity affecting the world. TONE: Meditative,\
    \ quiet, introspective voice maintained throughout. Pacing allows for reflection.\
    \ Transformative arc clear and earned."
