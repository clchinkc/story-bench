  evidence: The story successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the Three-Act Structure.
    Act 1 covers the setup, inciting incident (Yuki's letter), and the first plot
    point (Kenji deciding to go to Kyoto). Act 2A covers his arrival, initial interactions,
    and learning bamboo craft. The midpoint is the festival where he sees Yuki's life
    without him. Act 2B covers the business deal temptation (complication) and Yuki's
    rejection (second plot point). Act 3 covers his decision to decline the deal (climax)
    and the final resolution with the bamboo shop. All 8 core elements are preserved.
    The tone is consistently maintained. The word count is significantly over the
    requested range.
