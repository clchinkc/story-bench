  evidence: The model explicitly states 'NO REVISION NEEDED' and then proceeds to
    provide multiple revisions, none of which address the actual flaw. It misinterprets
    the 'All Is Lost' beat entirely, suggesting the original 'effectively conveys
    the desperation and isolation'. The revisions provided do not remove Marcus's
    options, support system, or hope, nor do they introduce a 'whiff of death'. The
    model's analysis is completely off-base. It also fails to preserve any of the
    required phrases and significantly changes the original text structure, despite
    claiming minimal changes.
