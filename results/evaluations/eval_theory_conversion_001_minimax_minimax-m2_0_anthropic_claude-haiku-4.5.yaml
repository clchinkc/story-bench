  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-executed.\
    \ Exposition establishes Samira's 15-year reputation, her lab world, and the anomalous\
    \ protein discovery. Rising Action escalates through 72-hour containment, evolving\
    \ pathogen, and the realization of engineered design. Climax peaks at the Nexus\
    \ confrontation with maximum tension (quarantine failure imminent, legal threats,\
    \ career at stake). Falling Action shows press conference consequences, formula\
    \ distribution, and investigation launch. Denouement delivers new equilibrium\
    \ with Samira at peace despite career sacrifice. All 6 core elements preserved:\
    \ protagonist (Samira), engineered virus discovery, Raj, Nexus antagonist, public\
    \ cure release, career sacrifice. Tone maintains medical thriller tension with\
    \ ethical weight throughout\u2014particularly strong in climax section with 'ethical\
    \ electricity' and the formula-as-weapon moment. DEDUCTIONS: Word count (820)\
    \ exceeds target range (500-700) by 120 words, representing 17% overage. This\
    \ is a structural constraint violation but doesn't affect narrative quality. Minor:\
    \ The denouement could be slightly more concise; some phrases ('the quiet machinery\
    \ of accountability') are poetic but add length. Structural accuracy is near-perfect\u2014\
    the conversion from 3-act to 5-stage pyramid is seamless and theoretically sound,\
    \ though the climax section slightly bleeds into falling action territory (press\
    \ conference could be positioned as early falling action rather than climax conclusion)."
