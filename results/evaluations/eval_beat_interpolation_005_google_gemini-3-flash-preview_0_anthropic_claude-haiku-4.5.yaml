  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and excellently executed:
    (1) Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability through the burnt crema catalana
    and his confession about identity loss post-career; (2) Professional distance
    explicitly evaporates—shift from ''client'' to intimate moment is clear; (3) Shared
    moment is genuine and sensory-rich (standing over pot, spoon-feeding, flour on
    cheek); (4) Maya''s commitment deepens beyond contract when she admits staying
    ''because I want to see you actually taste your life again''—a choice rooted in
    care, not obligation. BEAT EXECUTION: Perfectly executes Act 2 Midpoint function—raises
    emotional stakes, shifts Maya from reactive (fulfilling contract) to proactive
    (choosing him), creates point of no return. The two million euro penalty reference
    signals she understands consequences but chooses anyway. MUST-NOT COMPLIANCE:
    All avoided—they''re vulnerable but not ''in love'' yet, Maya doesn''t leave,
    photo isn''t taken here, Alejandro''s walls genuinely lower. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY:
    Both characters authentic—Alejandro''s guarded vulnerability, Maya''s steady compassion.
    BRIDGE QUALITY: Seamless connection between beats—BEFORE establishes stakes/isolation,
    GENERATED shows wall-lowering and choice, AFTER logically follows with external
    conflict testing their commitment. CONTINUITY: Setting (kitchen, late hour, copper
    saucepan) is consistent; timeline flows naturally; emotional trajectory is coherent.'
