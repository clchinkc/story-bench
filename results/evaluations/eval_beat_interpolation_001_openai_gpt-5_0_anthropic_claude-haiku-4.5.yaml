  evidence: "All four required elements present and excellently executed: (1) Marcus\
    \ introduced as wise mentor figure with physical details (scar, gray temples,\
    \ curiosity shop owner); (2) Practical wisdom and tools provided (satchel contents,\
    \ compass explanation, advice about reading structures and asking precise questions);\
    \ (3) Elena's doubt shifts to reluctant acceptance (moves from 'returning this'\
    \ to 'fastened the satchel with fingers that shook less than she expected'); (4)\
    \ Librarian skills reframed as assets ('You read structures. You notice what others\
    \ skim past'). All must-not violations avoided: Elena remains doubtful and hesitant,\
    \ Marcus explicitly refuses to accompany her ('I won't walk it for you'), setting\
    \ remains in village/shop (not forest), no magical powers discovered. Character\
    \ voice maintains Elena's self-deprecating librarian perspective throughout. Bridge\
    \ between beats is seamless\u2014Elena enters the shop in refusal, leaves with\
    \ reluctant acceptance and tools. Continuity perfect: Marcus's compass and satchel\
    \ are referenced in the 'After' section, confirming narrative flow. The prose\
    \ quality is exceptional with vivid sensory details and meaningful dialogue that\
    \ advances both character and plot."
