  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw (Sophie returning unchanged) by adding
    concrete signs of transformation: she leaves her phone in her pocket, notices
    the return-of-tension and uses a meditation breath, explicitly states she learned
    she was ''running on autopilot,'' turns the phone screen off after seeing the
    emergencies, and tells her mother she''ll wait until morning. The change is noticed
    by the mother and contrasted with Sophie’s prior reflex to immediately respond.
    The revision preserved the required elements and key phrases (airport arrival,
    mother''s question, Chicago skyline, ''It''s good to be home,'') and kept the
    original scene structure, making mostly surgical additions and small behavioral
    edits rather than a wholesale rewrite.'
