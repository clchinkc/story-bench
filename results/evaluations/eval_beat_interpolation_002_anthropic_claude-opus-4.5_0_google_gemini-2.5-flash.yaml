  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The 'Debate' beat's
    narrative function is clearly fulfilled as Sarah wrestles with her options. All
    'must not' items are successfully avoided. Character consistency and continuity
    are strong, and the bridge to the next beat is seamless.
