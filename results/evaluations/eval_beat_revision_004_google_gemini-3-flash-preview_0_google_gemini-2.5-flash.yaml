  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' for exposition. It completely rewrote the segment to demonstrate
    Rachel's traits, her relationship with James, and the setting through action,
    dialogue, and sensory details. While the changes were extensive (a complete rewrite),
    they were necessary to fix the fundamental flaw of 'telling' vs 'showing' in exposition.
    All required elements and phrases were preserved, and the quality of the writing
    is excellent, effectively setting up the character and world.
