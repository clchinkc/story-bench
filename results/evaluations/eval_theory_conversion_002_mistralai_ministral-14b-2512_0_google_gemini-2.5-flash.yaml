  evidence: All 12 beats of the Hero's Journey are clearly present and well-articulated.
    All 7 core elements are perfectly preserved. The word count is within the specified
    range. The tone is consistently quiet, meditative, and transformative throughout
    the narrative. The structural flow from one beat to the next is seamless and logical,
    adhering perfectly to the target theory.
