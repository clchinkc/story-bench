  evidence: "The model recognized the actual flaw (no visible change on Return) and\
    \ attempted to fix it: Sophie turns her phone face down, declines to handle the\
    \ emergency until morning, and explicitly calls the retreat 'transformative' and\
    \ says she 'learned to let go.' These actions address changed behavior, an applied\
    \ insight, and a physical marker. However, the revision omits one required element:\
    \ the mother does not notice anything different about Sophie, so the update is\
    \ only a partial correction. The edit was minimal and surgical\u2014key phrases\
    \ and structure were preserved\u2014so preservation and minimal-change scores\
    \ are high. Word count is under the required 200\u2013350 range (invalid). Overall\
    \ prose is clear with no major errors."
