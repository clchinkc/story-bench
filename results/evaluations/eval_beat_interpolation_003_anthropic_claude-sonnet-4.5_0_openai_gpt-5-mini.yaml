  evidence: 'All four required elements appear: Yuki explores multiple areas (crew
    quarters, medical bay), discovers clues (research notes about ''Dimensional permeability'',
    warm coffee), encounters transformed crew as shimmers that block her path and
    push data, and she overcomes fear/obstacle to continue (breathes, steels herself,
    steps forward). None of the prohibited items occur: she does not immediately find
    the data core or receive a full explanation, the shimmers do not directly explain
    everything (they push coordinates/access codes), she does not choose to leave,
    and she had not known about the transformation beforehand. Continuity with the
    BEFORE and transition toward the AFTER (Lab Seven) are clear.'
