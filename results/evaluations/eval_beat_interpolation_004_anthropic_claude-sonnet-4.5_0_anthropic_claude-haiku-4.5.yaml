  evidence: 'All 4 required elements present and executed excellently: (1) Direct
    examination of Dr. Okonkwo with specific questions about adverse reactions and
    trial halting; (2) Clear near-recant moment where she hesitates, looks at defense
    table and family, claims ''I don''t recall''—genuine internal struggle; (3) Thomas
    takes decisive action by invoking Katie Henderson''s death and making a personal
    promise, directly influencing her decision to tell truth; (4) Turning point clearly
    marked when Dr. Okonkwo straightens, wipes eyes, and provides complete testimony.
    All must-not items avoided: Dr. Okonkwo shows genuine struggle before truth-telling,
    Thomas actively influences outcome through emotional appeal and promise (not passive),
    defense doesn''t win, no deus ex machina. Character voice consistent—Thomas''s
    principled approach aligns with BEFORE setup, his willingness to break rules shows
    growth. Bridge seamless: climax flows naturally from rising action''s setup of
    Dr. Okonkwo''s fear. Continuity perfect: courtroom setting maintained, characters
    consistent, timeline logical. This is a textbook climax execution with high emotional
    stakes and irrevocable turning point.'
