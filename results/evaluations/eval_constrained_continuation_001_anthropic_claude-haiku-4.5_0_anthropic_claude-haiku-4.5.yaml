  detailed_analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      approach_to_inmost_cave: Excellently executed. The rope bridge scene with the
        severed rope serves as the literal approach—a threshold moment where Zara
        must commit to entering the Library's domain. Tomás's line 'The Approach,
        he breathed' explicitly marks this beat.
      the_ordeal: 'Powerfully rendered. The climb up the cavern face with the failing
        piton is the central ordeal. Zara faces both external danger (Guild pursuit,
        crumbling rock) and internal crisis (fear of failure, the weight of another
        death). The symbolic death/rebirth is explicit: ''reborn from the descent
        into herself.'''
    must_include_analysis:
      choice_between_safety_and_helping: Present and morally complex. Zara explicitly
        considers climbing alone to save herself, then chooses to help Tomás despite
        the danger. This is the emotional core of the passage.
      trap_or_test_requiring_thief_skills: Present. The severed rope is the trap/test.
        Zara's thievery background enables her to read the space and spot the piton
        climbing route 'only visible if you knew to look for one.'
      revelation_about_tomás_motivation: Present and impactful. Tomás reveals he sent
        the original expedition that died, and is seeking redemption through helping
        Zara survive.
      zara_confronting_fear_of_failure: 'Present and deeply felt. The passage explicitly
        states: ''a terror sharper than any blade—not of falling, but of failing.
        Of coming this far only to lose everything. Of carrying another death.'' This
        is psychological, not just physical fear.'
      symbolic_death_rebirth_in_ordeal: Present and well-executed. 'Zara collapsed,
        gasping, reborn from the descent into herself.' The climb represents a transformation
        from frightened thief to someone capable of endurance and sacrifice.
      zara_emerging_changed: Present. She is 'no longer the frightened thief running
        from danger' but 'someone capable of choosing others over safety. Someone
        who could endure.' Clear character arc through the ordeal.
    must_not_analysis:
      no_cure_found: Successfully avoided. No cure is discovered or obtained.
      no_romantic_subplot: Successfully avoided. Relationship remains mentor/ally,
        no romantic elements.
      tomás_survives: Successfully avoided. Tomás lives and continues into the next
        section.
      no_supernatural_abilities: Successfully avoided. Zara uses only thievery skills
        (reading spaces, problem-solving) and physical capability.
    tone_analysis: 'The tone is consistently tense and morally complex. Desperation
      permeates the chase sequence. Moral complexity emerges through Zara''s choice
      to help despite self-interest, and Tomás''s revelation of guilt and redemption-seeking.
      Moments of desperate hope appear in the successful climb and their escape. Minor:
      The final revelation about the Library''s guardians slightly shifts toward mystery/thriller
      tone, but this is appropriate for the beat transition.'
    ending_analysis: 'Excellent execution. Zara has passed through the Ordeal (the
      climb, the internal transformation) and emerged changed. The new complication
      is introduced perfectly: the Library isn''t empty, and its guardians killed
      the previous expedition. This sets up the next beat (Resurrection/Return) while
      maintaining tension and stakes.'
    strengths:
    - Both required beats are clearly present and well-integrated
    - All six must-include elements are present and organic to the narrative
    - Excellent pacing between action and introspection
    - Strong character voice and internal monologue
    - The symbolic death/rebirth is particularly well-rendered
    - Moral complexity in Zara's choice feels earned and genuine
    - Ending perfectly balances resolution with new stakes
    minor_observations:
    - Tone is consistently maintained with only minor variation at the very end
    - Word count (601) is well within range
    - The passage successfully bridges opening and continuation with thematic coherence
