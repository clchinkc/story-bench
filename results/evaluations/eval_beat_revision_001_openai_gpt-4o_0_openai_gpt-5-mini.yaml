  evidence: "The revision explicitly addresses the actual flaw: the dragon exploits\
    \ Kira's guilt about her brother, producing an internal confrontation with her\
    \ deepest fear. The text creates a symbolic 'death' moment (an abyss of despair\
    \ that threatens to swallow her spirit) and then a rebirth (a flicker of resolve,\
    \ reframing her fight as honoring her brother), tying her victory to new understanding\
    \ rather than mere persistence. Changes are moderate \u2014 several new introspective\
    \ beats and lines were added, but core phrases, setting, and outcome were preserved\
    \ (the four required elements/phrases appear, with only minor grammatical adjustment\
    \ to 'an earth-shaking roar'). The execution is improved and mostly satisfies\
    \ the Ordeal beat, though the symbolic 'death' could be more fully dramatized;\
    \ overall prose quality is good with no major new errors."
