  evidence: 'The model clearly targeted the missing ''Return (Having Changed)'' beat:
    it shows Sophie responding differently to work (scheduling a call at 9, switching
    to Do Not Disturb), applying a concrete insight from the retreat (using her breathing/steady
    rhythm), and displaying a physical marker (palm to chest, letting the phone hum).
    There is visible contrast (her mother relaxes; Sophie watches the skyline with
    new attention) so the journey is integrated. Changes were minimal and surgical—original
    lines and structure are preserved while concise actions and internal beats were
    inserted to demonstrate change.'
