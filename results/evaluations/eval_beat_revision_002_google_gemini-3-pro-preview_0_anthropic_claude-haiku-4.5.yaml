  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Marcus still had multiple\
    \ viable options (fundraiser, grant, new location) and intact support systems,\
    \ creating a 'setback' rather than 'rock bottom.' The revision systematically\
    \ eliminates all escape routes: (1) fundraiser venue canceled by developer, (2)\
    \ grant denied due to lease contingency, (3) wife leaves due to his obsession,\
    \ (4) Denise betrays him by accepting developer's job offer. The 'whiff of death'\
    \ is multi-layered\u2014loss of marriage, staff loyalty, and identity as a youth\
    \ program director. Marcus is left genuinely hopeless with no cards to play. All\
    \ 4 required phrases preserved verbatim: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice\
    \ in his hands,' 'Thirty days to vacate the community center,' '\"There has to\
    \ be something we can do,\" said Denise,' and 'He rubbed his temples.' All 4 story\
    \ elements preserved: Marcus as protagonist, community center setting, eviction\
    \ crisis, Denise's presence. Changes were surgical rather than wholesale\u2014\
    the model kept the opening structure and dialogue framework while inserting specific\
    \ failures and emotional devastation. The writing quality is strong with effective\
    \ sensory details ('The clink of metal on wood was final,' 'sounds of kids playing\
    \ basketball...now sounded like ghosts') and appropriate emotional escalation.\
    \ Minor deduction from minimal_change_score (0.75 vs 1.0) because approximately\
    \ 40% of the revision is new content, though this is justified by the beat's requirements.\
    \ No new errors introduced."
