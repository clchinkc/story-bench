  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the 'telling not showing'
    flaw. It transformed the summary into a scene, showing Rachel's instincts, her
    relationship with James, her devotion to cold cases, and the setting through sensory
    details and action. The changes were significant, essentially a rewrite, but necessary
    to fix the core flaw of 'telling' vs 'showing'. All required elements and phrases
    were preserved.
