  evidence: The model correctly identified that Sophie needed to show evidence of
    change upon her return. It addressed this by having her respond differently to
    work stress (turning phone face down, deciding work can wait), implying a specific
    lesson from the retreat ('I learned to let go of some things'), and showing a
    behavioral marker of change (new priorities, changed relationship with phone).
    Her mother's reaction isn't explicitly stated, but Sophie's internal monologue
    and actions provide the contrast. The changes were surgical and minimal, focusing
    on the dialogue and Sophie's internal state/actions. The phrase 'The familiar
    Chicago skyline appeared' was slightly altered to 'The familiar Chicago skyline
    appearing', which is a minor deviation from exact preservation.
