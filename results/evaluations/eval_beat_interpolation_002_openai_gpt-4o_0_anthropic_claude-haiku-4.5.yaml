  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Recanting\
    \ considered explicitly ('simplest option: recanting her testimony'). (2) Official\
    \ channels explored through Marcus and Morrison ('go to Morrison, get protection').\
    \ (3) Internal conflict powerfully rendered ('integrity...what were they worth\
    \ if it cost her sister's life?'). (4) Turning point via father's chess memory\
    \ ('the only way to win is to change the game') that catalyzes the third option.\
    \ Beat function executed perfectly\u2014genuine wrestling with alternatives, seeking\
    \ advice, internal deliberation leading to commitment. Character voice consistent\
    \ and authentic throughout. VIOLATIONS: One must-not item violated\u2014Sarah\
    \ has already decided to go rogue by the end of the Debate beat ('she'd chosen\
    \ her path...outside those confines, she could strike'). This slightly compresses\
    \ the transition into Break Into Two, where the AFTER section shows her resignation.\
    \ The decision should remain more ambiguous at beat's end, with commitment to\
    \ action deferred to the next beat. CONTINUITY: Minor issue\u2014the AFTER section\
    \ references 'seventy hours left' and 'case files she'd copied before turning\
    \ in her badge,' which implies planning that wasn't shown in the Debate beat itself.\
    \ BRIDGE: Strong thematic connection between Marcus's words and her realization,\
    \ though the actual resignation happens in the next beat as intended. Overall\
    \ execution is sophisticated and emotionally resonant despite the minor structural\
    \ violation."
