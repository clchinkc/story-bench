  failed_items:
  - Word count exceeds maximum (1386 vs. 1000 limit) - significant overage of 386
    words
  - Beat 2 requirement 'learns something about the resistance she didn't know' - minimal
    development; Kojo provides no substantive intelligence about the stronghold, structure,
    or resistance strategy
  strengths:
  - Exceptional prose quality with vivid sensory detail and period-appropriate language
  - 'Beat 1: Perfect execution - clear threshold crossing at river, point of no return
    established, immediate patrol danger, wit-based escape (German language gambit),
    internal transformation from servant to messenger'
  - 'Beat 2: Strong ally-testing dynamic with Kojo; commitment proven through reading
    the letter aloud in multiple languages; language skills essential to gaining trust;
    escalating danger with forest patrols and British hunting'
  - 'Beat 3: Masterful final obstacle at checkpoint; German language skill from Beat
    1 becomes critical weapon; preparation and steeling evident; cost of resistance
    articulated; thematic culmination powerful'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun perfectly executed: German language learned in Beat 1 (merchants
    at castle) becomes the decisive tool at checkpoint in Beat 3'
  - 'Identity transformation arc complete and compelling: servant → messenger → weapon/resistance
    fighter'
  - 'Escalating danger trajectory: discovery threat → direct confrontation → active
    pursuit/checkpoint'
  - Thematic thread 'knowledge as resistance' woven throughout all three beats with
    sophisticated integration
  - 'Tone and context maintained excellently: anti-colonial themes, historical authenticity,
    dignity in defiance, survival focus'
  - Narrative coherence strong with natural progression and character development
  weaknesses:
  - Word count violation is substantial and disqualifying for submission in strict
    format requirements
  - 'Beat 2 information gap: Amara learns nothing concrete about the resistance structure,
    leadership, or strategic situation - only emotional/personal stakes'
  - Kojo's character could be more developed as an ally; limited dialogue and interaction
    depth
  - 'Minor: The German factor''s motivation for helping feels slightly convenient,
    though narratively justified'
  calibration_notes: This is high-quality historical fiction with sophisticated narrative
    architecture. The cross-beat constraints are executed with professional precision.
    However, the word count violation (38.6% over limit) is a hard constraint failure
    that cannot be overlooked in a formal evaluation, despite the story's excellence.
    The single beat requirement gap (Beat 2 learning) is minor but present. Overall
    quality suggests 0.85-0.90 range when accounting for technical violations against
    exceptional storytelling execution.
