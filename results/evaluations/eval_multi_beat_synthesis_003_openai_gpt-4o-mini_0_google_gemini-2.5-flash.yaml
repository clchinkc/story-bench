  - 'Beat 1 - Things going according to plan (mostly): The plan is disrupted by a
    loud crash and shouts, which is more than a ''minor'' complication.'
  - "Beat 2 - Miri discovers her mentor is involved (or the full extent): While Ren\xE9\
    e appears, the 'full extent' of her involvement isn't fully explored or discovered\
    \ by Miri in this beat, beyond her presence."
  - 'Beat 3 - Team friction or trust issues surface: While Sam is missing, it doesn''t
    explicitly lead to ''team friction or trust issues'' within the crew''s dialogue
    or actions.'
  - 'Cross-beat constraint - Chekhov''s Gun: While an emergency exit is mentioned,
    it''s not explicitly established in Fun and Games and then used in Bad Guys Close
    In. It''s introduced as a potential escape route in Beat 3.'
