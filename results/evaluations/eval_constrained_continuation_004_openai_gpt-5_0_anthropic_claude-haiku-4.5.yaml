  beats_analysis: 'First Plot Point clearly marked: ''We publish,'' she said (decision
    to publish manuscript, point of no return). Act 2 Opening clearly marked: ''Before
    dawn they woke the beasts'' (new world of Eleanor as director, rising action begins
    with implementation and immediate threat).'

  must_include_analysis: '1) Eleanor decides to publish: ''We publish'' decision scene.
    2) Central conflict established: profit vs. ethics/danger throughout (creditors,
    libel risk, safety concerns). 3) Eleanor defies Victorian expectations: takes
    helm of business, addresses pressroom, signs contracts, makes executive decisions.
    4) Thomas Chen as ally with stake: his family''s rent, his wages, his position
    as immigrant vulnerable to scandal. 5) Danger hinted: threatening note with ammonia
    smell, ''a Blackwood will join it.'' 6) Irreversible threshold crossed: ''There
    was no recalling a word once set and sent'' and presses running.'

  word_count: 1012
  word_count_valid: false
  word_count_analysis: 'Exceeds maximum by 312 words (target: 500-700, actual: 1012).
    This is a significant constraint violation.'
  tone_score: 0.95
  tone_analysis: 'Excellent maintenance of Gothic tension (fog, chiaroscuro lighting,
    sleeping beasts, funeral imagery, threatening note), feminist undertones (woman
    presuming to shout, defying expectations, naming her stake), and Victorian atmosphere
    (gas lamps, omnibus, Fleet Street, respectability concerns, formal language).
    Minor: could be slightly more Gothic in places, but overall exceptional.'
  ending_score: 1.0
  ending_analysis: 'Perfect execution: Eleanor is fully committed to dangerous path
    (''There was no recalling a word once set and sent''), Act 2 clearly begun with
    presses running, bundles distributed, city about to respond. The threshold has
    been crossed irreversibly.'
  failed_constraints:
  - 'CRITICAL: Word count 1012 exceeds maximum of 700 by 312 words (44% over limit)'
  overall_assessment: Exceptional narrative quality with perfect story structure,
    all required elements, and masterful tone. However, the word count violation is
    a hard constraint failure that significantly impacts the score despite the writing's
    excellence.
