  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original flaw was Sophie's lack
    of change upon returning. It addressed this by showing her responding differently
    to work stress, applying a lesson from the retreat (breathing, being present),
    demonstrating a behavioral marker of change (putting phone away, choosing her
    pace), and having her mother notice the change. The changes were surgical and
    minimal, primarily focused on Sophie's internal monologue and actions related
    to the phone and her mother's reaction. The core structure and setting remained
    intact.
