  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Thomas directly examines Dr.
    Okonkwo, there is a clear internal struggle (fear/fracture in her resolve suggesting
    a near-recant), Thomas takes decisive action (offers the letter/assurance for
    her daughter) which influences her choice, and the turning point results in her
    confession and truth prevailing. No must-not items are violated. Deductions: word
    count is outside the required range (466 words; allowed 300–450). Minor pronoun
    ambiguity in the opening line (''He adjusted his tie'') could momentarily confuse
    whether it refers to Thomas or his father, but this does not materially affect
    continuity or character consistency.'
