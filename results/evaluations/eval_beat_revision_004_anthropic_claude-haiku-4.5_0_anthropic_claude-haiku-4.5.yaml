  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: the original segment was
    pure exposition-as-info-dump (telling through summary) rather than showing character
    through lived action. The revision transforms this by: (1) Grounding Rachel in
    a specific scene (kitchen table, Tuesday morning) with sensory details (jazz,
    cooling coffee, cat at ankles); (2) Revealing her detective instincts and work
    obsession through behavior (cold case file in bag, scrolling email at home, can''t
    let cases go); (3) Showing her partnership with James through natural dialogue
    exchange that demonstrates their dynamic (''Your instinct or mine?'' / ''That''s
    why we work''); (4) Introducing Sherlock organically within the scene rather than
    as biographical fact; (5) Establishing setting through action and observation
    rather than summary. All 4 required phrases are present: ''Rachel Torres'' (opening),
    ''Detective James Oyelaran'' (dialogue), ''cat named Sherlock'' (explicit), ''Tuesday
    morning in October'' (explicit). The changes were surgical—the model preserved
    the core character facts, relationships, and setting while converting static description
    into dynamic scene. The ending hook (unexpected internal call) adds narrative
    momentum appropriate to exposition''s role in Freytag''s structure. Minor: the
    phrase ''twelve years on the force'' appears in narration rather than dialogue,
    but this is a natural integration. Writing quality is professional with no new
    errors. The revision fully satisfies the beat definition by establishing baseline,
    showing characteristic behavior, and creating investment through specificity and
    interaction.'
