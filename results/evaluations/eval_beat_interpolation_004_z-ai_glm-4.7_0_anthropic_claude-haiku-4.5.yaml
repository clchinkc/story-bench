  evidence: 'All four required elements present and executed excellently: (1) Direct
    examination of Dr. Okonkwo with specific exhibit questioning; (2) Clear near-recant
    moment where she claims data was ''inconclusive'' and cannot attest to accuracy,
    creating genuine tension; (3) Thomas takes decisive action by revealing knowledge
    of blackmail and offering alternative medical solution, directly influencing her
    decision; (4) Turning point clearly marked when she straightens her spine and
    declares ''It is a lie,'' with immediate consequences (CEO''s smile vanishes).
    No violations of must-not items: Okonkwo''s truth-telling involves genuine internal
    struggle and near-recant; Thomas is highly active and influential rather than
    passive; defense doesn''t win; the medical protocol was set up proactively (not
    deus ex machina). Character voices remain consistent—Thomas is determined and
    resourceful, Okonkwo is conflicted then resolute, Judge is authoritative. Seamless
    bridge from BEFORE (setup of fear and stakes) to AFTER (consequences of her testimony).
    Setting continuity perfect: courtroom → sidebar → center of room → hallway. Climax
    beat function fully executed with maximum tension, decisive action, and irrevocable
    turning point.'
