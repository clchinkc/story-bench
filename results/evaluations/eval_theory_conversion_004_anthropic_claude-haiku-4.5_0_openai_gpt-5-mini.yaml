  evidence: All eight Harmon's beats are present and mapped clearly (You, Need, Go,
    Search, Find, Take, Return, Change). All eight required elements (Zoe, library/program,
    Ms. Okafor, Bernard, Zoe's anxiety, town-hall, Bernard's death, journalism school
    ending) are preserved. Small deduction from a perfect structural score because
    the 'Take' beat (paying a price) is resolved as public responsibility/public speaking
    but lacks a sharper cost or obstacle; otherwise the arc follows Harmon's circle
    tightly. Minor deduction to tone score for a couple of sentences that are more
    declarative than intimate, though overall the gentle, emotionally true tone is
    well maintained. Word count flagged invalid per the provided constraint (486,
    outside 500–700).
