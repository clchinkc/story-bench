  evidence: "ELEMENTS FOUND: (1) Thomas's direct examination present but minimal\u2014\
    he asks no substantive questions, only provides emotional support. (2) Moment\
    \ of near-recant is weak; her fear is mentioned in BEFORE but not actively dramatized\
    \ in the climax itself. (3) Thomas takes action (hand grip, emotional appeal)\
    \ that influences her decision\u2014PRESENT. (4) Truth prevails as turning point\u2014\
    PRESENT. MISSING: The actual examination questions and cross-examination dynamics\
    \ that define a courtroom climax. EXECUTION: The beat reads more as emotional\
    \ catharsis than structural climax. The 'turning point' is asserted rather than\
    \ shown through conflict. Lacks the procedural tension expected in a trial climax.\
    \ VIOLATIONS: One violation\u2014Thomas remains somewhat passive in his questioning\
    \ role; he provides encouragement but doesn't actively cross-examine or challenge\
    \ her testimony in ways that would constitute decisive prosecutorial action. The\
    \ climax relies heavily on her internal resolve rather than his strategic intervention.\
    \ CHARACTER: Thomas's voice is consistent but his prosecutorial expertise is underutilized.\
    \ Dr. Okonkwo's characterization is solid. BRIDGE: Excellent transition from BEFORE's\
    \ setup to AFTER's consequences. The hallway scene in AFTER directly references\
    \ her emotional state from climax. CONTINUITY: Setting remains courtroom/hallway.\
    \ Timeline is clear. Minor issue: the AFTER excerpt cuts off mid-sentence, but\
    \ what's present maintains continuity."
