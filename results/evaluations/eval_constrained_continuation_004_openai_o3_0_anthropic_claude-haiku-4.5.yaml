  analysis:
    beats_analysis: 'Both required beats are clearly present and well-executed. First
      Plot Point (Point of No Return): Eleanor''s declaration in the office (''That
      declaration—spoken aloud, inked in resolve—became the moment Eleanor crossed
      a line invisible yet irrevocable'') marks her commitment to publish. Act 2 Opening
      (New World/Rising Action): The transition is explicit (''Act Two had begun'')
      with Eleanor stepping into her new role as publisher, creditors granting a stay,
      and the brick through the window escalating tension.'
    must_include_analysis: 'All 6 elements present: (1) Eleanor decides to publish
      the manuscript (''I intend to honor that''); (2) Central conflict established
      (profit vs. ethics/danger—the brick threat, Scotland Yard involvement); (3)
      Defies Victorian expectations (commanding presses, negotiating with creditors,
      pawning mother''s pearls); (4) Thomas Chen as key ally with stake (works at
      night, shares risk, alliance forged); (5) Danger hinted (brick with threat,
      crimson handprint, Scotland Yard inquiry); (6) Irreversible threshold crossed
      (selling out first run, entering public consciousness, Yard''s ledger).'
    must_not_analysis: 'All 4 forbidden elements successfully avoided: (1) Jack the
      Ripper never appears as a character—only referenced through the manuscript and
      threat; (2) No graphic violence or murder descriptions—threats are implied,
      not depicted; (3) No romantic subplot—relationship remains professional and
      alliance-based; (4) No easy solution—financial problems remain urgent and dangerous,
      requiring continued risk.'
    tone_analysis: 'Gothic tension is masterfully maintained throughout: fog imagery
      (''murder of crows,'' ''swallowed rooftops''), gas lamps hissing like ''restless
      spirits,'' brick through window, crimson handprint, ''coal-tinged air.'' Feminist
      undertones are strong: Eleanor''s defiance of gender expectations, her command
      of machinery, her rejection of her brother''s relevance. Victorian atmosphere
      is richly rendered through period details (mourning black, creditors, Fleet
      Street, newsboys, Scotland Yard). Minor deduction only for occasional modern
      phrasing that slightly breaks immersion.'
    ending_analysis: Ending perfectly meets requirements. Eleanor is fully committed
      to the dangerous path ('She did not retreat'), Act 2 is explicitly begun ('Act
      Two had begun'), and the final image of her signaling Thomas to ready plates
      for Part II demonstrates forward momentum and resolve. The closing line crystallizes
      her transformation and stakes.
    constraint_failures:
    - 'Word count exceeds maximum: 821 words vs. 500-700 range (121 words over limit).
      This is a clear violation of the specified constraint, though the excess serves
      the narrative quality.'
    strengths:
    - Exceptional character development and voice
    - Masterful atmospheric writing with consistent Gothic tone
    - All structural and content requirements met
    - Strong feminist subtext woven naturally into narrative
    - Compelling stakes and escalating tension
    - Vivid period detail and sensory language
    - Clear narrative momentum into Act 2
    weaknesses:
    - Word count violation (821 vs. 500-700 max)
    - 'Minor: Some sentences could be tightened for concision'
  final_assessment: This is a high-quality story that exceeds most requirements with
    professional execution. The single constraint failure is the word count overage,
    which prevents a perfect score despite the narrative excellence. The story demonstrates
    sophisticated understanding of three-act structure, character development, and
    thematic integration. The Gothic atmosphere is palpable, feminist themes are organic
    rather than didactic, and Eleanor's journey is compelling and believable. The
    word count issue is the only measurable failure; all other elements score at or
    near maximum.
