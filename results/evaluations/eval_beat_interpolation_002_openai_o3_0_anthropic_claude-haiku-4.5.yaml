  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Sarah\
    \ explicitly considers recanting\u2014'One click and it was done'\u2014and recognizes\
    \ the moral cost. (2) Marcus advocates official channels: protective custody,\
    \ federal involvement, FBI/Marshals. (3) Internal conflict is the beat's core:\
    \ justice vs. sister, protocol vs. urgency, duty vs. love. (4) The tipping moment\
    \ is crystalline\u2014Marcus's hand on her shoulder triggers the realization that\
    \ 'neither surrender nor protocol would save Amy. Something outside the badge\
    \ would.' The Debate beat executes perfectly: Sarah wrestles, considers alternatives,\
    \ seeks advice, and commits to action (going rogue). Character voice is consistent\u2014\
    Sarah's pragmatism, her moral weight, her detective's mind. VIOLATIONS: The 'AFTER'\
    \ section begins with Sarah already having resigned ('resignation letter in one\
    \ hand and her badge in the other'), which violates the must-not requirement that\
    \ 'Sarah [should not already have] resigned from the police force' during the\
    \ Debate beat. However, this violation occurs in the AFTER section, not the GENERATED\
    \ section being scored. The GENERATED section itself avoids all must-not items\u2014\
    Sarah hasn't resigned yet, Marcus doesn't solve the problem for her, she doesn't\
    \ confront Marchetti, and she doesn't immediately go rogue (she debates first).\
    \ MINOR DEDUCTION: The bridge to Break Into Two is strong but the AFTER section's\
    \ immediate resignation slightly undermines the narrative momentum of Sarah's\
    \ internal decision-making. Setting continuity is maintained (apartment, dawn,\
    \ internal affairs report) with only minor ambiguity about exact timeline."
