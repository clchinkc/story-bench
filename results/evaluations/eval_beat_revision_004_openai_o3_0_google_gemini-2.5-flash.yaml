  evidence: The model correctly identified the 'telling not showing' flaw in the original
    exposition. It transformed the summary into a scene that actively demonstrates
    Rachel's traits, her relationship with James, and the setting. While the changes
    were extensive, they were necessary to fix the fundamental flaw of 'telling' versus
    'showing' in exposition. The model did not introduce new errors and maintained
    high writing quality.
