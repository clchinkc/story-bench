  detailed_analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      approach_to_inmost_cave: Present and well-executed. The passage through the
        hidden crevice, the descent into darkness, the trap disarming, and the pursuit
        by enforcers all constitute the approach phase leading to the Library entrance.
      the_ordeal: Excellently realized. The collapsing bridge sequence serves as the
        climactic ordeal where Zara faces both physical danger and internal fear,
        culminating in symbolic death/rebirth.
    must_include_analysis:
      choice_between_escape_and_helping: "\u2713 Present. 'The enforcers were closing\
        \ in; she could make it alone, sacrifice him for speed... But Tom\xE1s had\
        \ trusted her.' Clear moral choice with internal conflict."
      trap_requiring_thief_skills: "\u2713 Present. The pressure plate trap that Zara\
        \ disarms using her lock-picking expertise and careful observation."
      "revelation_about_tom\xE1s": "\u2713 Present. After sealing the archway, Tom\xE1\
        s reveals his true motivation: clearing his father's name and studying the\
        \ Library for personal redemption, not just guiding Zara."
      confronting_fear_of_failure: "\u2713 Present. 'Below, the darkness yawned like\
        \ failure\u2014not just death, but the end of her quest, her mother doomed\
        \ because she wasn't clever or strong enough.' Explicitly addresses inadequacy\
        \ and failure anxiety."
      symbolic_death_rebirth: "\u2713 Present. 'In that moment, she felt a part of\
        \ herself die\u2014the girl who doubted, who feared inadequacy\u2014and from\
        \ the ashes rose a hardened resolve.' Clear symbolic transformation."
      emerging_changed: "\u2713 Present. 'Zara's hands were raw, but her mind was\
        \ clear, focused. She had faced the abyss and chosen to fight.' Demonstrates\
        \ internal and external transformation."
    must_not_analysis:
      no_cure_found: "\u2713 Avoided. Zara reaches the Library entrance but hasn't\
        \ obtained the cure."
      no_romantic_subplot: "\u2713 Avoided. Relationship remains professional and\
        \ emotionally complex but non-romantic."
      "tom\xE1s_survives": "\u2713 Avoided. Tom\xE1s is alive and present at the end."
      no_supernatural_abilities: "\u2713 Avoided. All of Zara's abilities are grounded\
        \ in thief skills and physical prowess."
    tone_assessment: Tense and morally complex throughout. Moments of desperate hope
      appear in Zara's determination and the revelation of shared purpose. The pacing
      maintains urgency. Minor deduction only because the tone could have been slightly
      more desperate in places, though it's very well-executed overall.
    ending_assessment: Perfect execution. Zara has passed through the Ordeal (bridge
      collapse, internal transformation), emerged changed and hardened, but faces
      immediate new complication (ancient creature with claws and growl). Sets up
      next phase while maintaining tension.
