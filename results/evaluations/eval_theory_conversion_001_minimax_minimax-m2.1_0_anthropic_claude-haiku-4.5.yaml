  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All five Freytag beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Exposition establishes Samira''s 15-year reputation and the anomalous discovery.
    Rising Action spans the 72-hour containment chaos and the Nexus revelation. Climax
    peaks at the CEO''s ultimatum and Samira''s refusal. Falling Action covers the
    press conference and legal aftermath. Denouement provides the new equilibrium
    (unemployment but peace). All 6 core elements preserved: protagonist, engineered
    virus, Raj, Nexus antagonist, public cure release, career sacrifice. Word count
    (564) falls within valid range (500-700). Tone maintains medical thriller tension
    throughout with ethical weight in the final choice. MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Structural
    accuracy slightly reduced (0.95 vs 1.0) because the climax could be more sharply
    delineated—the CEO confrontation and press conference blur together slightly,
    though this is a minor issue. Tone score (0.95) reflects that while tension is
    excellent, the denouement''s ''peace'' resolution is somewhat understated compared
    to the thriller intensity of earlier sections, though this is intentional and
    effective. Overall execution is professional and demonstrates strong understanding
    of Freytag''s Pyramid application.'
