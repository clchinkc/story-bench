  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Thomas directly questions Dr.
    Okonkwo; there is a clear moment of near-recant as she falters and looks fearful;
    Thomas takes decisive action (requests recess, personally intervenes, offers to
    help secure treatment) that influences her decision; the turning point occurs
    when she breaks the seal and testifies, allowing truth to prevail. None of the
    must-not items occur (Dr. Okonkwo struggles before speaking, Thomas is active,
    the defense does not win, and no deus ex machina appears). Character behavior
    and voices are consistent with prior setup, the climax clearly bridges the rising
    action and the falling action, and setting continuity is maintained. The only
    issue is word count: 476 words, which exceeds the specified 300–450 range, so
    word_count_valid is false.'
