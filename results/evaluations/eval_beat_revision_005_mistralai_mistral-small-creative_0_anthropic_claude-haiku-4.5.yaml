  evidence: 'The model completely failed the primary task. Instead of recognizing
    that the original segment was correctly executed and required NO REVISION, the
    model provided a rewritten version of the scene. The rewrite demonstrates that
    the model either: (1) misunderstood the task instructions, or (2) over-diagnosed
    the original as flawed when it was explicitly stated to be correct. The model''s
    rewrite, while competent and maintaining the Dark Night of the Soul beat, represents
    an unnecessary revision of already well-executed material. The model did show
    decent understanding of the beat itself (isolation, despair, reflection, no solutions,
    mortality element are all present in both versions), but this understanding was
    not applied to the correct task: recognizing when a segment is ALREADY CORRECT
    and needs no changes. This is a critical failure in the evaluation framework—the
    model should have stated ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' with reasoning explaining why
    the original satisfied all requirements, rather than providing an alternative
    version.'
