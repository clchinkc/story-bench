  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation
    and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.
    The revision fixes this precisely by: (1) Adding internal conflict (''thumb hovered
    over the screen, the old reflex...'') showing the temptation to revert, (2) Integrating
    a specific retreat lesson (''the silence of the retreat, the breath he had learned
    to take before reacting''), (3) Demonstrating changed behavior through action
    (turning off phone instead of typing response), (4) Creating visible contrast
    (''Everything exactly as she''d left it, yet it seemed smaller somehow, less overwhelming''),
    (5) Having mother implicitly notice change through Sophie''s different demeanor
    and word choice. All 4 required phrases preserved exactly or near-exactly: ''Sophie''s
    flight landed at O''Hare'' (exact), ''How was Thailand?'' her mother asked'' (exact),
    ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'' (exact), ''''It''s good to be home,''
    she said'' (exact). Changes were surgical: inserted internal monologue about the
    retreat lesson, replaced immediate phone-typing with conscious choice to power
    down, added sensory/emotional reflection about Chicago. Original structure, characters,
    setting, and work pressure element all maintained. No new errors introduced; prose
    quality improved with stronger sensory detail and emotional authenticity.'
