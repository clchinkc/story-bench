  evidence: "The revision targets the actual flaw (Sophie shows no transformation)\
    \ by having her pause before answering work emails, breathe, and resolve to enjoy\
    \ being back\u2014an attempt to show changed behavior. This is a correct diagnosis.\
    \ However, the correction is partial: the change is mild and mostly internal narration\
    \ rather than concrete, repeated behavior or a specific lesson from the retreat;\
    \ the mother does not explicitly notice the change and there's no clear physical\
    \ marker or explicit application of a retreat insight. The edit preserved all\
    \ required narrative elements and phrases, and kept most of the original structure\
    \ with small-to-moderate additions (hence a high minimal-change score). Writing\
    \ quality is strong with no new errors."
