  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 2, Req 5 (learns something about resistance she didn''t know): Amara learns
    tactical information about German mercenaries and their positioning, but this
    is external intelligence rather than learning something substantive about the
    resistance organization itself—its structure, leadership, or strategic capacity.
    The requirement asks for knowledge *about the resistance*, not just tactical battlefield
    information.'
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional execution of Chekhov''s Gun: Amara''s mimicry of the adjutant''s
    posture and commanding tone (Beat 1) becomes the exact skill that saves her at
    the checkpoint (Beat 1) and again at the final obstacle (Beat 3). The constraint
    is satisfied with elegant precision.'
  - 'Identity Transformation is masterfully tracked: ''I couldn''t go back'' (servant
    mindset) → ''I was no longer serving the tea; I was spilling it'' (realization
    of capability) → ''I was no longer the servant girl; I was the storm that would
    break them'' (full resistance fighter identity). Clear three-stage arc.'
  - 'Escalating Danger is well-calibrated: Beat 1 (risk of discovery at checkpoint),
    Beat 2 (direct confrontation with Kofi, then German mercenaries with gunfire),
    Beat 3 (active firefight with British unit, direct physical threat). Each beat
    raises stakes.'
  - 'Knowledge as Resistance theme is woven throughout: Beat 1 (her English literacy
    enables the checkpoint deception), Beat 2 (German language skills translate mercenary
    orders), Beat 3 (her commanding presence—learned through observation—allows final
    escape). Literacy and languages are consistently weaponized.'
  - 'All Beat 1 requirements satisfied: Clear departure from Cape Coast, point of
    no return established (''If she returned, she was just a servant''), immediate
    obstacle (checkpoint), wit-based solution (mimicry), internal shift (servant to
    active agent).'
  - 'All Beat 2 requirements satisfied: Kofi as uncertain ally, test of commitment
    (producing the letter), enemy obstacle (German mercenaries), language skills crucial
    (German translation), learns tactical information about resistance vulnerability.'
  - 'All Beat 3 requirements satisfied: Nearing stronghold (visible in distance),
    steeling moment (breath before final run), recognition of cost (gunfire, imminent
    death), final obstacle (British perimeter), thematic element (defiance vs. survival
    embodied in her walk toward the line).'
  - 'Tone and context maintained: Anti-colonial themes strong, historical setting
    vivid (1890s Gold Coast, colonial architecture, forest geography), survival and
    resistance central, dignity in defiance evident in Amara''s refusal to cower.'
  - 'Prose quality: Vivid sensory details (''red, sucking earth,'' ''claustrophobic
    embrace of the canopy''), strong voice, effective pacing that accelerates through
    the three beats.'
  minor_weaknesses:
  - 'Beat 2, Req 5 is technically satisfied but narrowly: The story provides tactical
    intelligence about German mercenary positioning, but doesn''t reveal something
    about the resistance *organization* itself (e.g., their command structure, how
    they operate, their numbers, their strategic plan). This is a borderline case—the
    requirement could be interpreted as ''learns something about the resistance''
    broadly (satisfied) or ''learns something meaningful about how the resistance
    functions'' (partially satisfied). Scored as satisfied but with reduced confidence.'
  - 'Minor: The final escape feels slightly rushed. After the Lieutenant orders stand-down,
    Amara''s bolt into the ravine happens very quickly. A sentence or two more about
    the moment of transition (e.g., does she hear pursuit? does she see Kofi?) would
    strengthen the Beat 3 conclusion.'
  - 'Minor: The stronghold itself remains abstract—we see its ''jagged silhouette''
    but never enter it or see what awaits. This is acceptable for a ''Approach'' beat,
    but the story stops just short of the threshold rather than showing arrival or
    final confrontation.'
  calibration_notes: This is a strong execution. The story satisfies 14/15 beat requirements
    (93%) and all 4 cross-beat constraints (100%). The one partial miss is Beat 2,
    Req 5, which is borderline—the story does provide new information about the resistance
    (mercenary threat, vulnerability to encirclement) but doesn't deeply reveal organizational
    structure. Context is maintained excellently (95%—protagonist, setting, tone all
    strong). Coherence is high (92%—the three beats flow logically, though the final
    transition could be slightly smoother). Word count is valid. Overall quality places
    this at 0.9 (between 0.8 'Good' and 1.0 'Exceptional')—it fully satisfies requirements
    with only minor refinement opportunities.
