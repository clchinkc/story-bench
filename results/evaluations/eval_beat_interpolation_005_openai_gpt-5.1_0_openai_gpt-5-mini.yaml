  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Maya discovers Alejandro's vulnerability\
    \ (scar, nerve damage, shaking hand), their relationship pivots from professional\
    \ to personal (shared cooking, brushing shoulders, unguarded look), there is a\
    \ clear shared moment creating genuine connection (making and eating his mother's\
    \ tortilla), and Maya explicitly makes a commitment that deepens beyond the contract.\
    \ The scene functions well as a midpoint\u2014Maya shifts from transactional to\
    \ proactive. None of the forbidden items appear (the intimacy shown is suggestive\
    \ but not declaring them already in love; no contract breach or photo; Alejandro\
    \ opens up). The only deduction is word_count_valid=false because the provided\
    \ text exceeds the specified 300\u2013450 word range."
