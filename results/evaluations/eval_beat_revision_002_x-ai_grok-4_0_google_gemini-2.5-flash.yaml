  evidence: "The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey\
    \ a true 'All Is Lost' moment. It addressed all aspects of the flaw: \n1. **Fundraiser/Grant\
    \ Failure:** The revision explicitly states 'The fundraiser tanked' and 'the grant?\
    \ I just got the email. Denied.'\n2. **Personal Loss/Betrayal/Isolation:** Denise\
    \ betrays Marcus, and his wife's voicemail indicates their marriage is in jeopardy,\
    \ leaving him truly alone.\n3. **Giving Up Hope:** Marcus states 'No, Denise.\
    \ There isn't.' and 'It's over.' and 'But there was no plan left.'\n4. **Whiff\
    \ of Death:** The loss of the youth program is equated to 'losing them all, piece\
    \ by piece' and the 'death knell' headache, along with the potential loss of his\
    \ marriage and purpose.\n\nThe changes were significant to achieve the 'All Is\
    \ Lost' beat, but they built upon the original text rather than rewriting it entirely.\
    \ The core setup and initial dialogue were maintained, with new elements woven\
    \ in to escalate the despair."
