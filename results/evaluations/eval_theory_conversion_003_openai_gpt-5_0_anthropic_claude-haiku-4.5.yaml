  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats are clearly present and well-executed.\
    \ Act 1 (Setup) establishes Kenji's loss and introduces the wedding catalyst.\
    \ Act 2A (Rising Action, First Half) covers his arrival, meeting Haruki, and initial\
    \ reconnection with Yuki. Act 2B (Rising Action, Second Half) features the business\
    \ deal temptation and Yuki's rejection. Act 3 (Resolution) shows his refusal of\
    \ ambition, the wedding day reconciliation, and the bamboo shop denouement. All\
    \ 8 core elements are preserved with sophistication: protagonist Kenji, lost career,\
    \ estranged Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki mentor figure, business temptation, thematic\
    \ choice, and bamboo shop ending. Tone is exceptional\u2014quiet, contemplative,\
    \ with Japanese aesthetic sensibilities (bamboo imagery, bowing, shrine visits,\
    \ seasonal thinking). The prose is literary and redemptive without sentimentality.\
    \ DEDUCTIONS: Word count (1099) significantly exceeds target range (550-750) by\
    \ 349 words (+47% over maximum). This is a material structural violation. Structural\
    \ accuracy is 0.9 rather than 1.0 because the conversion prioritizes literary\
    \ depth over strict three-act economy\u2014some beats blend together poetically\
    \ rather than demarcating clearly, which is intentional but technically less aligned\
    \ with Syd Field's discrete act structure. The conversion succeeds artistically\
    \ but fails the word count constraint."
