  evidence: The structural accuracy is good, but the 'Midpoint' and 'Bad Guys Close
    In' from the original Save the Cat structure are somewhat condensed into a single
    section in Act 2A, making the distinction between rising action first half and
    second half slightly less pronounced than ideal for a strict three-act conversion.
    However, the overall progression and placement of key plot points (inciting incident,
    first plot point, second plot point, climax, denouement) are correct.
