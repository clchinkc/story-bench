  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: Marcus still had multiple
    viable options (fundraiser, grant, new location) and maintained intact support
    systems, preventing true ''All Is Lost'' impact. The revision systematically eliminates
    all escape routes: (1) major donor withdrawal removes fundraiser viability, (2)
    grant rejection eliminates that option, (3) reserves already depleted, (4) Denise''s
    departure isolates Marcus emotionally and removes his support system. The ''whiff
    of death'' is present through the metaphorical loss of identity/purpose and the
    emotional devastation of failing the children. All four required phrases preserved
    exactly: ''Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands,'' ''Thirty days
    to vacate the community center,'' ''"There has to be something we can do," said
    Denise,'' and ''He rubbed his temples.'' All four story elements preserved: Marcus
    as protagonist, community center setting, eviction crisis, Denise character present.
    Changes were surgical rather than wholesale—the revision maintains the original
    structure and opening while strategically adding concrete failures (donor pullout,
    grant rejection) and emotional isolation (Denise''s departure, Marcus unable to
    open wife''s text). The writing quality improved with stronger emotional resonance
    and clearer stakes. Minor weakness: the ending could push slightly further into
    despair/numbness to maximize the beat''s impact, though current execution is strong.'
