  evidence: "All 12 Campbell beats are present and clearly mapped: Ordinary World\
    \ (pottery teaching), Call (dried spring), Refusal (Maya's hesitation), Meeting\
    \ the Mentor (grandmother via dreams/letter/journal), Crossing the Threshold (setting\
    \ out for the shrine), Tests (climb, storm, blisters), Approach (ruined shrine,\
    \ searching), Ordeal (night of surrender), Reward (the vessel and insight), Road\
    \ Back (difficult return, doubt), Resurrection (final acceptance and/or spring\
    \ revival), Return with Elixir (water and Maya's transformed self). All 7 required\
    \ elements are preserved (Maya, pottery, grandmother's legacy, mountain shrine\
    \ journey, dried spring problem, theme of surrender, Maya's transformation). Word\
    \ count is exactly 640 (within 600\u2013800). Minor deduction in structural_accuracy_score\
    \ for two small structural weaknesses: the 'Meeting the Mentor' is indirect (journal/dreams\
    \ rather than a living mentor figure) and the Tests/Allies/Enemies beat lacks\
    \ explicit allies or antagonists (tests are present but no named allies/enemies).\
    \ Tone is a quiet, meditative transformation throughout."
