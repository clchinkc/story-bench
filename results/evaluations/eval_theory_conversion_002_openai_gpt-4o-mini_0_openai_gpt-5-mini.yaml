  evidence: "All 12 monomyth beats are represented: Ordinary World (village/pottery),\
    \ Call to Adventure (dry spring), Refusal (hesitation/fear), Meeting the Mentor\
    \ (grandmother's journal/words of guidance), Crossing the Threshold (setting out\
    \ on journey), Tests/Allies/Enemies (arduous trek/tests\u2014no explicit allies\
    \ or enemies named), Approach to Inmost Cave (arriving at ruined shrine, preparing),\
    \ Ordeal (surrendering control while shaping the vessel), Reward (the completed\
    \ vessel), The Road Back (difficult return, temptation to abandon), Resurrection\
    \ (final demonstration of transformed self at the spring), Return with the Elixir\
    \ (water restored, Maya as guardian). All seven required elements are preserved.\
    \ Deductions: structural_accuracy_score reduced because the 'Meeting the Mentor'\
    \ occurs after the threshold (mentor is a found journal rather than a pre-threshold\
    \ guide) and the Tests/Allies/Enemies stage lacks explicit allies or antagonists\u2014\
    these are minor structural departures from a textbook sequence but do not remove\
    \ the beats. Tone retained very well (quiet, meditative, transformative)."
