  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: recanting is considered, official
    channels are weighed, the duty-vs-sister internal conflict is explicit, and a
    pivotal conversation with Marcus tips her toward the third option. The scene effectively
    performs the Debate beat (weighing alternatives, seeking counsel, committing).
    No ''must not'' items appear: she doesn''t immediately go rogue, no one else makes
    the decision, she hasn''t resigned yet, and there is no direct confrontation with
    Marchetti or his people. The only deduction is word_count_valid=false per the
    given word_count (outside the 250–400 range).'
