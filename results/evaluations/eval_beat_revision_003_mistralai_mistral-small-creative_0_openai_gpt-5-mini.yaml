  evidence: 'The model appears to have addressed the Actual Flaw: it shows Sophie
    returning changed by having her deliberately not respond to urgent work messages,
    physically slipping her phone into her bag, invoking the retreat''s ''quiet stillness,''
    and prompting her mother''s surprise—demonstrating a contrast with her pre-journey
    workaholic behavior. This diagnosis is correct. The fix is mostly successful:
    it provides behavioral markers, a visible contrast, and the mother noticing a
    difference. It stops short of naming a concrete, specific lesson or actionable
    technique from the retreat (e.g., a named insight or practice she explicitly applies),
    so the correction is strong but not fully exhaustive. Changes were moderate and
    surgical: core lines and structure are preserved while adding reactions and internal
    beats to show change.'
