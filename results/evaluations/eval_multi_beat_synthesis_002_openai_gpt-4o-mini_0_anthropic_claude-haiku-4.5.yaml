  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 2, Req 3 (Enemy/Obstacle forcing adaptation): The wiry man''s suspicion
    is introduced but not developed as a true obstacle that forces Amara to adapt
    her strategy. The tree-climbing test resolves too quickly and cleanly without
    showing her struggling to overcome skepticism or resistance.'
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional execution of Chekhov''s Gun constraint: Language skills (English,
    local dialect) introduced in Beat 1 become the decisive tool for the dog encounter
    in Beat 3'
  - "Identity transformation arc is clear and compelling: servant \u2192 shadow/whisper\
    \ \u2192 fighter across all three beats"
  - "Escalating danger is well-calibrated: discovery threat \u2192 direct confrontation\
    \ with patrol and wary fighters \u2192 active pursuit implied by trained hunting\
    \ dog"
  - 'Thematic thread of ''knowledge as resistance'' woven throughout: literacy/languages
    as survival tools, intelligence gathering, linguistic code-switching'
  - Strong atmospheric writing with vivid sensory details (salty air, rough bark,
    thick tension)
  - Authentic historical voice and anti-colonial perspective maintained throughout
  - Clear point of no return established (letter, father's life at stake, crossing
    into forest)
  - Immediate obstacles present at threshold (British patrol, forest dangers)
  - Wits over force demonstrated consistently (hiding from patrol, tree-climbing test,
    dog calming)
  - Internal shift from servant-scholar to active resistance fighter is explicit and
    earned
  weaknesses:
  - "Beat 2 obstacle (wiry man's suspicion) lacks sufficient tension\u2014resolved\
    \ through single test rather than forcing genuine adaptation or strategy shift"
  - "The dog encounter, while thematically resonant, feels somewhat convenient as\
    \ a final obstacle\u2014could benefit from higher stakes or more complex resolution"
  - "Limited exploration of what 'reaching the stronghold will cost'\u2014the recognition\
    \ moment is present but somewhat abstract rather than concrete sacrifice"
  calibration_notes: This is a strong, well-executed narrative that satisfies nearly
    all requirements with professional quality. The cross-beat constraints are all
    met with sophistication. The single minor gap (Beat 2 obstacle) prevents a perfect
    score but does not significantly detract from overall quality. The story demonstrates
    clear understanding of Campbell's monomyth structure while maintaining historical
    authenticity and thematic coherence.
