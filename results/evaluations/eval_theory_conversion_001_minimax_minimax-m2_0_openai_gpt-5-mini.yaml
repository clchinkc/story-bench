  evidence: "All five Freytag beats are clearly present and all six core elements\
    \ are retained. Minor deductions: the climax slightly conflates revelation and\
    \ public confrontation (discovery begins in rising action, press conference functions\
    \ as peak), and the tone is polished and resolves a bit rapidly \u2014 nevertheless\
    \ it maintains strong medical-thriller tension and ethical weight."
