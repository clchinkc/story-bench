  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Multiple
    station areas explored: crew quarters, medical bay, junction alcove, Lab Seven.
    (2) Clues discovered progressively: abandoned personal items, corrupted logs mentioning
    ''phase variance'' and ''Subject stability'', scorched restraint strap with anomalous
    density. (3) Transformed crew encountered mysteriously: shimmer distortions, heat-haze
    figures, indirect communication through static and flickering. (4) Obstacles overcome:
    gravity fluctuations, magnetic lock requiring bypass, multiple distortions blocking
    her path. The Search beat executes perfectly—Yuki actively adapts, uses technical
    skills, and makes incremental progress toward Lab Seven. Character voice remains
    consistent (clinical, methodical, analytical). Seamless bridge from BEFORE to
    AFTER: she enters unfamiliar situation, searches methodically, and arrives at
    the data core. Setting continuity maintained throughout. MINOR VIOLATION: Word
    count is 419, exceeding the 250-400 range by 19 words (4.8% over). MUST-NOT ITEMS:
    All avoided—she doesn''t immediately understand the transformation (only realizes
    it during Search), crew doesn''t explain everything directly (only Reyes''s fragmented
    voice at the very end), she doesn''t abandon her mission, and she doesn''t arrive
    with prior knowledge. The partial violation at the end (Reyes''s voice) is minimal
    and occurs at the transition point, not during the Search proper.'
