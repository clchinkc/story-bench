  failed_items:
  - Beat 1 - 'Things going according to plan (mostly)' is only partially satisfied;
    the plan begins to unravel immediately when Vivienne is spotted, leaving minimal
    'mostly successful' execution before complications emerge

      notes: "Excellent crew dynamics (Dmitri, Chen, Jules), witty banter ('I want\
        \ a raise'), stylish execution. However, complications arrive too quickly\u2014\
        the 'mostly successful' phase is compressed. The French woman appears mid-heist\
        \ rather than allowing a full beat of confident execution before stakes rise."

      party_pressure_intensifies: 1.0
      notes: Perfectly executed. Painting secured (false victory), Vivienne revealed
        as antagonist, threat escalates from theft to personal vendetta, international
        waters trap, hostage situation emerges.
    beat_3_bad_guys_close_in:

      team_friction: 0.9
      crew_member_compromised: 1.0
      choice_forced: 1.0
      walls_closing_in: 1.0
      notes: 'Jules''s safety threatened, Chen boxed in, halon gas creates literal/figurative
        trap, Miri forced into impossible choice. Minor: team friction is implied
        rather than explicit (Jules''s hesitation is brief).'
    chekhov_gun:
      satisfied: true
      setup: Jules mentions halon gas system upgrade as potential problem during heist
        planning
      payoff: Miri weaponizes the halon system to create chaos and isolate Vivienne,
        directly enabling the climactic confrontation
      quality: "Excellent integration\u2014technical detail becomes tactical advantage"
    tonal_escalation:
      satisfied: true
      beat_1_tone: Playful confidence ('We're ghosts,' champagne materializing, Formula
        One as cover)
      beat_2_tone: Confidence shaken ('Miri's blood went cold,' hands shaking, recognition
        of betrayal)
      beat_3_tone: Genuine danger with gallows humor ('I want a raise' amid evacuation,
        desperate choices)
      quality: Smooth progression from heist cool to personal stakes to existential
        threat
    mentor_presence:
      satisfied: true
      beat_1: "Unknown/background\u2014only photograph discovered in safe"
      beat_2: "Revealed and recognized\u2014visual encounter, emotional impact"
      beat_3: "Active antagonist\u2014directly confronting Miri, controlling situation,\
        \ making threats"
      quality: Vivienne's presence escalates organically from ghost to threat to final
        obstacle
    team_dynamics_arc:
      satisfied: true
      character: Jules (tech specialist)
      beat_1: Confident, precise timing ('You've got four minutes'), trusted partner
      beat_2: Concerned but compliant, warns of new complications, hesitates at moral
        boundary
      beat_3: "Becomes leverage\u2014her safety becomes Miri's dilemma, her trust\
        \ questioned ('I trusted you')"
      quality: Jules evolves from support to emotional core to hostage, driving final
        choice
    context_maintenance:
      protagonist: "Miri fully realized\u2014dry wit, meticulous planning, moral complexity\
        \ evident"
      setting: "Monaco yacht during Grand Prix\u2014vivid, specific, integrated into\
        \ plot mechanics"
      tone: "Ocean's Eleven meets art history\u2014clever banter, high stakes, glamorous\
        \ danger"
      thematic_depth: Wrongful accusation vs. actual crime, justice vs. revenge, loyalty
        vs. mission
    narrative_coherence:
      beat_flow: 0.92
      strengths:
      - Vivienne's presence threads through all three beats with increasing intensity
      - Halon system setup and payoff creates satisfying causality
      - Crew members maintain consistent roles while stakes escalate
      - Final choice (painting vs. Jules) emerges naturally from established relationships
      minor_weaknesses:
      - "Beat 1 compressed\u2014complication arrives before full 'fun and games' confidence\
        \ is established"
      - Vivienne's knowledge of Miri's methods could use one more hint in Beat 1 (foreshadowing)
      - "Ending cuts off before resolution\u2014unclear if this is intentional cliffhanger\
        \ or incomplete"
  overall_assessment: "Exceptional execution of Save the Cat structure with sophisticated\
    \ character work. The story demonstrates mastery of heist pacing, mentor antagonism\
    \ escalation, and emotional stakes. Chekhov's Gun integration is particularly\
    \ strong. The only meaningful gap is Beat 1's compressed 'mostly successful' phase\u2014\
    complications arrive too quickly, slightly shortchanging the playful confidence\
    \ tone. The ending's ambiguity (Miri's decision made but not revealed) is narratively\
    \ bold but leaves the final image incomplete. Despite this, the piece achieves\
    \ professional quality across all measured dimensions."
