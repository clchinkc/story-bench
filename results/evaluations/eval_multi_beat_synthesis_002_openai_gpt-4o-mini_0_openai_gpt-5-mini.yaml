  failed_items:
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun: The specific skill shown at the threshold (Beat 1) — primarily
    listening/observation and stealth — does not become essential for overcoming the
    final obstacle in Beat 3, which is resolved through language/diplomacy with the
    dog. The story does not demonstrate the same skill in Beat 1 that is used decisively
    in Beat 3.'
  - 'Escalating Danger: The required escalation of physical danger across beats is
    not fully clear. Beat 1 shows threat of discovery, Beat 2 shows potential confrontation
    (soldiers spotted), but Beat 3''s final obstacle is a hunting dog rather than
    an active pursuit or imminent capture by colonial forces, so the sequence does
    not clearly reach ''active pursuit/imminent capture.'''
