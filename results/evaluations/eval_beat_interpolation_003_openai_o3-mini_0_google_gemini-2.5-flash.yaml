  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas (corridor,
    med bay, crew quarters), discovers clues (locker, note, logs), encounters transformed
    crew (flickering figures), and overcomes an obstacle (sealed door). No ''must
    not'' items were violated. The narrative clearly shows Yuki actively searching
    and adapting, fitting the ''Search'' beat. Character and continuity are maintained,
    and it bridges well from the ''Go'' to the ''Find'' beat by setting up the discovery
    of the data core and the nature of the crew''s transformation.'
