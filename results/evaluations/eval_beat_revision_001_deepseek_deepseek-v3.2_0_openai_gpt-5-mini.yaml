  evidence: "The model clearly addressed the actual flaw: it made the Ordeal an internal\
    \ confrontation by having the dragon exploit Kira's guilt over her brother's death,\
    \ inserted a symbolic 'death' (the hero she thought she was dies as she sinks\
    \ to her knees and surrenders), and provided a rebirth/transformation (the whispered\
    \ oath, acceptance, and a changed approach to the strike). Victory results from\
    \ new understanding/acceptance rather than mere persistence. Preservation was\
    \ strong: all four required phrases and all four preservation elements (Shadow\
    \ Dragon antagonist, Kira with a sword, reference to brother's death, Kira's victory)\
    \ are present. Changes were moderate \u2014 the original structure and many lines\
    \ were kept, but substantial interior material and emotional beats were added\
    \ (hence a midline minimal_change_score). Writing quality is high and no new substantive\
    \ errors were introduced, though the original grammatical quirk 'a earth-shaking\
    \ roar' was preserved as required."
