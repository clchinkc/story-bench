  evidence: The word count is slightly over the limit, but all required elements are
    present and executed perfectly. No 'must not' items were violated. The characterization
    of Thomas and Dr. Okonkwo is consistent with the 'BEFORE' beat, and the transition
    to the 'AFTER' beat is seamless, clearly establishing the climax as the turning
    point.
