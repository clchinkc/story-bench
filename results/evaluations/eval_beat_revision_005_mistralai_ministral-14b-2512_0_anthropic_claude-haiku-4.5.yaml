  evidence: 'The model completely failed the task. It was presented with an ORIGINAL
    SEGMENT that was correctly executed and required NO REVISION. Instead of recognizing
    this and stating ''NO REVISION NEEDED'', the model provided an entirely rewritten
    version of the scene. The model rewrote the apartment description, expanded the
    internal monologue, added new details about the gallery being boarded over, introduced
    new narrative elements (the postcard, the private collector sale), and restructured
    the emotional arc. This is a false positive diagnosis—the model over-corrected
    and unnecessarily revised a segment that already satisfied all Dark Night of the
    Soul beat requirements. The model demonstrated partial understanding of the beat
    (it included isolation, despair, reflection, and mortality elements in its rewrite),
    but fundamentally misunderstood the task: it was supposed to evaluate whether
    revision was needed, not to provide an alternative version. The reasoning quality
    is poor because the model provided no explicit reasoning about why it chose to
    revise—it simply presented a new version without acknowledging that the original
    was already adequate.'
