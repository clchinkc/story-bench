  model_said_no_revision: true
  evidence: 'The model responded ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' and provided a clear explanation:
    it cited the gallery closure as the All Is Lost moment, noted Maya''s isolation
    in a dark apartment, described genuine despair and reflection with no solutions
    offered, and pointed to the memory of the mother''s passing as the ''whiff of
    death.'' This matches the provided beat requirements.'
