  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All four required elements present and well-executed. (1)\
    \ Marcus introduced as mentor with clear characterization (lean frame, sharp eyes,\
    \ gravelly voice, runs curio shop). (2) Practical wisdom provided: research as\
    \ a weapon, reading forest signs, librarian skills reframed as quest-relevant.\
    \ Tools given: satchel, brass compass with narrative purpose. (3) Elena's doubt\
    \ shifts convincingly from 'utterly ordinary' refusal to 'reluctant possibility'\u2014\
    the knot loosens, she picks up compass and satchel. (4) Librarian skills explicitly\
    \ validated: 'piecing together fragmented history,' 'deciphering dead languages,'\
    \ 'finding crucial facts'\u2014all recontextualized as quest preparation. All\
    \ must-not items avoided: Elena remains doubtful (not confident/eager), Marcus\
    \ doesn't accompany her or solve problems, setting is village curio shop (not\
    \ forest), no magical powers discovered. Character voice consistent throughout\u2014\
    Elena's hesitation, Marcus's gravelly wisdom, the mentor-student dynamic. Bridge\
    \ between beats seamless: BEFORE ends with refusal; GENERATED shows mentor encounter\
    \ shifting perspective; AFTER shows Elena at forest threshold ready to cross.\
    \ Continuity perfect: compass and satchel from Generated appear in After; Marcus's\
    \ words echo in After; fog and threshold imagery connect. WEAKNESS: Word count\
    \ (488) significantly exceeds requirement (200-350), representing 39% overage.\
    \ This is a notable structural violation despite narrative quality. The excess\
    \ comes from detailed characterization and dialogue, which enhances execution\
    \ but violates constraints."
