  evidence: The model correctly identified the 'telling not showing' flaw in the original
    exposition. It revised the segment to show Rachel's character, her relationship
    with James, her dedication to cold cases, and the setting through sensory details
    and action, rather than summary. The changes were moderate, transforming the narrative
    style significantly while retaining core elements. All required preserved phrases
    and elements are present.
