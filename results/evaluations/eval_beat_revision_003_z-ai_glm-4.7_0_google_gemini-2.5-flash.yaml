  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that Sophie needed to show change upon
    her return. It addressed all five points of the required fix: (1) Sophie responds
    differently to work stress by choosing not to immediately reply, (2) A specific
    lesson from the retreat (the breath before reacting, the silence) is applied,
    (3) A behavioral marker of change is present (clicking the power button, looking
    out the window instead of at the phone), (4) Contrast is visible through her internal
    struggle and choice, and (5) Her mother notices something different implicitly
    by the change in Sophie''s behavior and her subsequent statement. The changes
    were surgical and minimal, preserving the original structure and required phrases.'
