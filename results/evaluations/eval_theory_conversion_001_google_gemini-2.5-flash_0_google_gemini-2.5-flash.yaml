  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the original three acts to Freytag's
    five stages. The Exposition clearly sets up Samira and the virus discovery. Rising
    Action details the escalating crisis and the discovery of Nexus Biotech's involvement.
    The Climax is well-defined with Samira's realization and the decision to confront
    Nexus. Falling Action covers the press conference and the public release of the
    cure. The Denouement provides a clear resolution with the outbreak contained and
    Samira's personal outcome. All six core elements are preserved, and the medical
    thriller tone with ethical weight is consistently maintained throughout the narrative.
