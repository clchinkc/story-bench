  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats clearly present\u2014Act 1 establishes\
    \ Kenji's corporate loss and Yuki's letter (Setup + Inciting Incident + First\
    \ Plot Point); Act 2A shows village arrival, Haruki mentorship, tentative bonding\
    \ (Rising Action/Obstacles + Midpoint); Act 2B introduces investor temptation,\
    \ Yuki's betrayal, isolation (Complications + Second Plot Point); Act 3 delivers\
    \ climax (declining offer, apology, wedding witness) and denouement (bamboo shop,\
    \ transformed life). All 8 core elements preserved: Kenji protagonist, lost career,\
    \ estranged Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki craftsman, business temptation, theme\
    \ of people over ambition, bamboo shop ending. Tone masterfully maintained\u2014\
    quiet, contemplative, Japanese aesthetic (cherry blossoms, incense, bamboo, tea\
    \ ceremonies, shrine). Redemptive arc clear and earned. DEDUCTIONS: Word count\
    \ exceeds target by 6 words (756 vs. 750 max)\u2014minor violation but flagged\
    \ per criteria. Structural accuracy near-perfect; only minor observation is Act\
    \ 2B could slightly emphasize the 'second plot point' stakes more explicitly,\
    \ though the confrontation scene effectively serves this function. Tone execution\
    \ is exceptional throughout."
