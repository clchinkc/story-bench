  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - Clever problem-solving: The heist showcases crew skills but lacks specific
    clever solutions to obstacles; the plan is described as ''flawless'' without demonstrating
    tactical ingenuity'
  - 'Cross-beat constraint - Tonal Escalation: Tone shift is present but incomplete;
    Beat 1 lacks sufficient playful confidence (opens already tense), and the gallows
    humor in Beat 3 feels underdeveloped relative to the danger'
  strengths:
  - 'Beat 1 (Fun and Games): Strong execution of heist in action, crew skills showcased
    (Sasha''s tech, Jules''s charisma, Leo''s muscle), humor present (''Piece of cake''),
    mostly-on-plan execution with minor complication (unexpected security)'
  - 'Beat 2 (Midpoint): Excellent false victory (painting secured), stakes dramatically
    raised (mentor revealed), nature of heist shifts from simple theft to personal
    confrontation, party setting intensifies pressure effectively'
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In): Security closing in well-executed, team friction
    evident (Leo shaken, Sasha alarmed), crew member compromised (Jules cornered),
    Miri''s choice presented (painting vs. Jules), literal/figurative walls closing
    in'
  - "Chekhov's Gun (partial): Hidden service hatch established in Beat 1 ('every exit')\
    \ and recalled in Beat 3 as solution\u2014setup and payoff are traceable, though\
    \ the hatch isn't fully utilized in the narrative"
  - "Mentor Presence: Excellent escalation\u2014background threat (Beat 1), revealed/recognized\
    \ (Beat 2 'familiar figure'), active antagonist (Beat 3 'I've been expecting you')"
  - "Team Dynamics (Sasha): Consistent arc across beats\u2014tech wizard managing\
    \ systems, voice of reason, then alarmed by lockdown; affects plot by discovering\
    \ security compromise"
  - 'Context Maintenance: Protagonist voice authentic (dry wit evident), Monaco/yacht
    setting vivid, Ocean''s Eleven tone achieved with clever banter and glamorous
    heist setup'
  - 'Coherence: Narrative flows logically from setup through complication to crisis;
    character motivations clear; escalation feels earned'
  calibration_notes: "Story demonstrates strong command of Save the Cat structure\
    \ with 13/15 beat requirements met. The primary gap is in Beat 1's clever problem-solving\u2014\
    the narrative tells us the plan is 'flawless' but doesn't show specific tactical\
    \ ingenuity. Tonal escalation is present but could be sharper; Beat 1 opens with\
    \ tension rather than playful confidence, muting the tonal contrast. Chekhov's\
    \ Gun is partially satisfied\u2014the hatch is established and recalled but not\
    \ fully deployed as a critical solution. Cross-beat constraints score 0.75 due\
    \ to these two gaps. Context and coherence are strong (0.9 and 0.85 respectively),\
    \ with authentic character voice, vivid setting, and logical narrative flow. Overall\
    \ quality is 'Good' (0.8 range)\u2014fully satisfies core requirements with minor\
    \ execution gaps."
