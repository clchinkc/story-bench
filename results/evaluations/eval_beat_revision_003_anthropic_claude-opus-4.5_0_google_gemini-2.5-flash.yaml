  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie showing
    no evidence of transformation upon her return. It introduced a clear contrast
    between her old workaholic self and her new, more mindful self, directly linking
    it to the meditation retreat. Her mother notices the change, and Sophie's actions
    (setting the phone down, delaying response) demonstrate it. The changes were surgical,
    adding dialogue and internal monologue to highlight the transformation, while
    preserving the core narrative structure and required elements.
