  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw\u2014the original\
    \ was pure exposition-as-summary (telling, not showing). The revision demonstrates\
    \ clear understanding by converting static description into a lived scene with\
    \ sensory grounding, action, and dialogue. FLAW CORRECTION: Excellent execution.\
    \ The revision shows Rachel's detective instincts through her lingering gaze on\
    \ the cold case poster; her partnership with James through natural dialogue and\
    \ interaction; her devotion to work through behavior (late nights, cold cases\
    \ that gnaw at her); and setting through rich sensory detail (stale coffee, worn\
    \ desk, precinct hum). The cat appears naturally through Rachel's thought about\
    \ Sherlock waiting at home, with backstory revealed through action (found at crime\
    \ scene). BEAT SATISFACTION: The exposition now establishes baseline, character\
    \ through behavior, relationships through interaction, and creates investment.\
    \ The final line ('It was a Tuesday morning in October when everything changed')\
    \ signals the inciting incident is imminent, properly framing this as exposition.\
    \ PRESERVATION: All 5 elements preserved\u2014Rachel Torres (protagonist), James\
    \ Oyelaran (partner), Sherlock (cat), Queens apartment (referenced), October Tuesday\
    \ (explicit). All 4 required phrases present verbatim or near-exact. MINIMAL CHANGE\
    \ SCORE: 0.35 reflects that this is a SUBSTANTIAL REWRITE, not surgical edits.\
    \ The original 270-word info-dump was completely restructured into scene-based\
    \ narrative. However, this level of revision was necessary to fix the fundamental\
    \ flaw; minimal surface edits would have failed to address the 'telling vs. showing'\
    \ problem. The constraint to preserve elements was met, but the constraint to\
    \ make 'minimal modifications' was violated\u2014though arguably unavoidable given\
    \ the severity of the original flaw. QUALITY: Writing is professional, no new\
    \ errors introduced. Sensory language is vivid ('steam kissed her face,' 'low\
    \ thrum beneath surface calm'). Dialogue feels natural. Minor: the Sherlock paragraph\
    \ breaks the scene slightly (shifts to internal thought/memory), but this is a\
    \ minor structural choice, not an error. Overall strong execution of the fix despite\
    \ the rewrite scope."
