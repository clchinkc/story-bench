  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and excellently executed:\
    \ (1) Maya discovers Alejandro's anosmia/taste loss vulnerability through his\
    \ confession in the kitchen\u2014a profound emotional wound; (2) Relationship\
    \ shifts from professional/transactional to personal through the late-night cooking\
    \ scene and balcony conversation; (3) Shared moment of genuine connection: eyes-closed\
    \ trust exercise with caldo, his mother memory, the unguarded eye contact; (4)\
    \ Maya's commitment deepens beyond contract when she explicitly chooses to stay\
    \ 'not because I have to. Because I want to'\u2014a clear emotional pivot. All\
    \ must-not items avoided: they're not in love yet (attraction/connection only),\
    \ Maya doesn't leave or breach contract, photograph isn't taken during this scene,\
    \ Alejandro's walls lower authentically. Character voices remain consistent\u2014\
    Maya's quiet competence and empathy, Alejandro's guarded vulnerability. Bridge\
    \ is seamless: BEFORE establishes the setup/stakes, GENERATED executes the midpoint\
    \ reversal perfectly, AFTER shows the consequence. Setting continuity maintained\
    \ (kitchen\u2192balcony\u2192study). DEDUCTION: Word count (616) exceeds range\
    \ (300-450) by 166 words\u2014approximately 37% over limit. This is a significant\
    \ structural violation despite narrative excellence. The beat itself is executed\
    \ at professional/exceptional quality, but the constraint violation prevents perfect\
    \ overall score."
