  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw that Sophie showed
    no evidence of transformation upon her return. It introduced specific behavioral
    changes (hesitating with the phone, choosing not to respond to work emails immediately)
    and internal reflection (seeing things differently, a sense of peace) that directly
    contrast with her previous workaholic tendencies. The mother's observation is
    also included. The changes were surgical and minimal, focusing precisely on the
    flaw without rewriting large sections. All required preserved phrases and elements
    are present.
error: null
