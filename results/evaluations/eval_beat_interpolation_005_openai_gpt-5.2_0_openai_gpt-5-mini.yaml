  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Maya discovers Alejandro's loss\
    \ of taste (vulnerability); their relationship shifts from strictly professional\
    \ to personal through shared memories and conversation; a concrete shared moment\
    \ (the caldo, tasting with eyes closed, balcony) creates genuine connection; Maya\
    \ explicitly commits beyond the contract ('I'll stay... Not because I have to.\
    \ Because I want to.'). None of the prohibited items appear (no premature love,\
    \ no photo scene, no decision to leave, Alejandro does lower his guard). The only\
    \ issue is structural: the provided word count (616) is outside the requested\
    \ 300\u2013450 range."
