  evidence: "BEATS ANALYSIS: Present (9/12): 1-Ordinary World (village potter), 2-Call\
    \ to Adventure (dry spring), 3-Crossing Threshold (mountain journey begins), 4-Tests/Allies/Enemies\
    \ (arduous path, silence), 5-Approach to Inmost Cave (shrine discovery), 6-Ordeal\
    \ (reading journal, confronting grandmother's legacy), 7-Reward (mastering techniques,\
    \ transformation), 8-Road Back (returns to village), 9-Return with Elixir (water\
    \ flows, new pottery). MISSING (3/12): Refusal of Call (hesitation mentioned but\
    \ not dramatized as distinct beat), Meeting the Mentor (grandmother appears only\
    \ through journal, not as active guide), Resurrection (no final test/crisis before\
    \ return). PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact\u2014Maya (protagonist), pottery\
    \ (central), grandmother's legacy (journal discovery), mountain shrine (three-day\
    \ journey), dried spring (catalyst), surrender theme ('let go of control'), transformation\
    \ (explicit). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Conversion captures monomyth arc but lacks\
    \ distinct beat separation; Refusal and Mentor stages are underdeveloped or merged\
    \ with other beats. The journey feels more circular (Story Circle residue) than\
    \ clearly delineated stages. TONE: Meditative and transformative maintained throughout\
    \ with poetic language ('dry riverbeds of her heart,' 'clay flowing like water'),\
    \ though occasionally overwrought. CRITICAL ISSUE: Word count (504) falls significantly\
    \ short of 600-800 range (84 words under minimum), limiting narrative depth for\
    \ proper beat development."
