  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: (1) Sarah explicitly considers
    recanting and its consequences; (2) she considers official channels (Marcus recommends
    protective detail/FBI) and rejects them; (3) the internal duty-vs-family conflict
    is articulated (''I can''t testify... I can''t recant...''); (4) a pivotal conversation
    with Marcus crystallizes her conclusion and leads to her planning an exit strategy
    toward going rogue. None of the must-not items occur (no immediate rogue decision
    at the start, no one else makes the choice, she has not already resigned, and
    there is no direct confrontation with Marchetti). Character voice and continuity
    are consistent and the scene effectively bridges the catalyst to the subsequent
    Break Into Two by ending with her committed plan to leave the department.'
