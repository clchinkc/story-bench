  evidence: 'The model correctly identified the telling-vs-showing flaw and addressed
    it by staging a scene: Rachel making coffee, interacting with Sherlock, sensory
    detail (Miles Davis, October chill), and a brief exchange with Detective James
    Oyelaran that shows their partnership. This fixes most of the original problems
    (showing instincts via the file and dialogue, revealing devotion through behavior).
    Remaining small tell-lines persist (e.g., ''She''d chosen this path...'' and explicit
    mention of the broken engagement and ''a cold case from twelve years back''),
    so the correction is strong but not absolutely exhaustive. All five required story
    elements (Rachel as protagonist, James as partner, cat Sherlock, Queens apartment,
    Tuesday morning in October) are preserved. Of the four exact/near-exact required
    phrases, three appear (''Detective James Oyelaran'', ''cat named Sherlock'' via
    ''Sherlock, her sleek black cat'', and ''Tuesday morning in October''); ''Detective
    Rachel Torres'' as a phrase is not used (she appears as ''Rachel Torres''). Changes
    were moderate—a clear rewrite to create a scene rather than a few surgical edits—hence
    a middling minimal-change score. Writing quality is high with no new errors, though
    a couple of telling sentences remain.'
