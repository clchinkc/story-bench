  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Recanting
    temptation explicitly stated (''tempting, poisonous whisper''). (2) Official channels
    thoroughly debated with Marcus—reporting to Morrison, feds, precinct lockdown
    all discussed. (3) Internal conflict powerfully rendered (''duty as a cop'' vs
    ''duty as a sister''). (4) Third option crystallizes organically through dialogue
    (''neither path...would save Amy AND keep Marchetti incarcerated''). Character
    voice is consistent—Sarah''s pragmatism and moral complexity shine. Bridge to
    Break Into Two is strong, with resignation letter providing natural transition.
    VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah has already decided to resign and go rogue by the end of
    the Debate beat (''Sarah Chen—former detective, current vigilante''), which should
    occur in Break Into Two, not during Debate. The Debate should end with decision
    made but not yet executed. (2) The ''AFTER'' section shows her already outside
    Morrison''s office with resignation letter in hand, which is premature action
    that belongs in Break Into Two. The Debate beat should conclude with internal
    commitment, not external action. These violations blur the boundary between beats.
    CONTINUITY: Minor issue—the transition from ''A third option...began to solidify''
    to the AFTER section feels slightly abrupt, though the logic is clear. Setting
    remains consistent (precinct/office).'
