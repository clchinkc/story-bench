  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation\
    \ and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.\
    \ The revision fixes this comprehensively: (1) Sophie experiences the panic response\
    \ but consciously chooses differently\u2014turning off her phone rather than reflexively\
    \ responding; (2) A specific insight is integrated ('the sky didn't fall just\
    \ because she wasn't holding it up'); (3) Physical markers of change are clear\u2014\
    shoulders dropping, holding down power button, zipping phone away; (4) Contrast\
    \ is explicit between 'before the trip' behavior and present choice; (5) Mother\
    \ notices the difference ('Everything okay?' and the comfortable silence). All\
    \ 4 required phrases preserved exactly: 'Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare', 'How\
    \ was Thailand? her mother asked', 'The familiar Chicago skyline appeared', 'It's\
    \ good to be home, she said'. The changes were surgical\u2014the model kept the\
    \ scene structure, dialogue framework, and setting intact while inserting the\
    \ transformation evidence. The only substantial additions were the internal monologue\
    \ about the monk, the phone-turning-off action, and the final reflection. No new\
    \ errors introduced; prose quality improved with sensory details ('shoulders dropping\
    \ two inches', 'the rigid steel, the frantic grid of lights'). Minor: the revision\
    \ is slightly longer than minimal (305 words vs. original ~180), but this is justified\
    \ by the complexity of showing internal change. The beat execution is near-perfect\u2014\
    demonstrates Return with clear evidence of Change."
