  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are clearly present (exposition, rising action,
    climax, falling action, denouement). All six required elements are preserved.
    Deductions: structural_accuracy not 1.0 because the narrative contains closely
    spaced peaks (the revelation and the public confrontation) that slightly blur
    a single, singular turning point expected at the apex of Freytag''s Pyramid, and
    the falling action/containment sequences are somewhat compressed. Tone is excellent—sustained
    medical-thriller tension with ethical weight—but trimmed slightly for a minor
    amount of melodramatic exposition, so not a perfect 1.0.'
