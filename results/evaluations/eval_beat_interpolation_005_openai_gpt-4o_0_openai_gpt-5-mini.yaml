  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Maya uncovers Alejandro's vulnerability,\
    \ their relationship shifts from professional to personal, a shared paella moment\
    \ creates genuine connection, and Maya explicitly commits beyond the contract.\
    \ The scene cleanly performs the Midpoint function by making Maya proactively\
    \ choose emotional commitment. No forbidden items appear. A minor deduction (bridge_score\
    \ 0.9) reflects that the scene is somewhat idealized and doesn\u2019t immediately\
    \ introduce a new external complication to escalate stakes, though it still effectively\
    \ connects Act 1 motivations to the forthcoming crisis."
