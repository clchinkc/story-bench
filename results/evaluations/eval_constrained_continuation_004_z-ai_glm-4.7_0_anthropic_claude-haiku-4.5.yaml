  detailed_analysis:
    beats:
      first_plot_point: Eleanor's decision to print the manuscript ('Then we print')
        - clear point of no return with immediate consequences
      act_2_opening: Return to Blackwood & Sons with preparations beginning ('Prepare
        the press. Set the type yourself') - new world of active conspiracy and danger
        begins
    must_include_elements:
      1_decision_to_publish: Explicitly shown through dialogue and internal conflict,
        culminating in 'Then we print'
      2_central_conflict: 'Profit vs. ethics/danger clearly established: financial
        survival vs. moral hazard and personal danger'
      3_defying_expectations: Eleanor steps into proprietress role, shedding 'grieving
        daughter' for 'armor of a proprietress,' claiming power in male-dominated
        space
      4_thomas_as_ally: Thomas Chen fully developed as ally with personal stakes (parents'
        reliance, livelihood, family survival)
      5_hint_of_danger: 'Multiple hints: killer may see manuscript, ''come for the
        hunter,'' dangerous details about high-standing suspect'
      6_threshold_crossing: 'Explicitly stated: ''She had crossed the threshold. There
        was no going back'''
    must_not_violations: None - Ripper never appears; no graphic violence; no romantic
      subplot; financial problem remains unresolved
    tone_assessment: 'Exceptional gothic tension maintained throughout. Victorian
      atmosphere richly rendered (fog, gaslights, graveyards, class dynamics). Feminist
      undertones strong but not heavy-handed. Minor: could have slightly more atmospheric
      dread in final section, but overall masterfully executed.'
    ending_assessment: Perfect execution. Eleanor is fully committed to dangerous
      path. Act 2 clearly begun with machinery starting, conspiracy established, and
      stakes raised. No ambiguity about her resolve or the beginning of rising action.
