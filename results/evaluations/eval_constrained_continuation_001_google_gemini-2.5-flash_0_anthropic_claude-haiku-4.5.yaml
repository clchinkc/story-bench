  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'Approach to Inmost Cave: Clearly marked with ''The Veiled Path'' sequence,
      Gate of Whispers, and the descent toward the Library'
    - 'The Ordeal: Multi-layered ordeal including trap disarming, the plank crossing,
      psychological assault, and confrontation with inner fear'
    must_include_detail:
    - "Choice between escape and helping Tom\xE1s: Present - 'Escape was still an\
      \ option, a dash back into the market's chaos. But Tom\xE1s stood frozen...\
      \ She couldn't leave him.'"
    - 'Trap/test requiring thief skills: Present - Gate of Whispers disarming sequence
      with tripwires and pressure plates'
    - "Revelation about Tom\xE1s's motivation: Present - His confession about family\
      \ guardianship, exile, and personal redemption quest"
    - 'Zara confronting fear of failure: Present - Psychological ordeal with internal
      voice and mother''s face imagery; explicit internal rejection of despair'
    - 'Symbolic death/rebirth moment: Present - ''She felt scoured clean, stripped
      bare of her old anxieties, yet forged anew'' and transformation from helpless
      child to hardened survivor'
    - 'Zara emerging changed: Present - ''She was still Zara, but a Zara with a harder
      core, a clearer purpose'''
    must_not_detail:
    - "Cure not found: \u2713 Avoided - story ends before Library access"
    - "No romantic subplot: \u2713 Avoided - relationship remains professional/desperate\
      \ alliance"
    - "Tom\xE1s survives: \u2713 Avoided - he remains alive and present"
    - "No supernatural abilities for Zara: \u2713 Avoided - all actions use lockpicking,\
      \ knife work, and willpower"
    tone_assessment: Excellent maintenance of tense, morally complex atmosphere with
      desperate hope. The psychological ordeal adds moral complexity beyond simple
      physical danger. Minor deduction only for slight melodrama in the mother's face
      imagery, which edges toward overwrought.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect execution: Zara passes through Ordeal (symbolic rebirth
      achieved), emerges changed (harder core, clearer purpose), and faces immediate
      new complication (sentinel guardian blocking Library access). Sets up next stage
      seamlessly.'
    critical_issue: Word count violation is the only constraint failure. At 859 words,
      the piece exceeds the 700-word maximum by 159 words (22.7% over limit). This
      is a significant overage that would typically require revision. However, the
      excess length enables the rich psychological depth and multi-layered ordeal
      that makes the piece exceptional. The content quality is professional-grade,
      but the constraint violation is objective and measurable.
  overall_score: 0.78
  score_justification: "Exceptional content execution (all beats, all required elements,\
    \ all forbidden elements avoided, strong tone, perfect ending) severely compromised\
    \ by substantial word count violation. The 859-word count vs. 700-word limit represents\
    \ a clear constraint failure that cannot be overlooked despite the quality of\
    \ the writing. Score reflects: perfect content requirements (1.0) \xD7 0.78 penalty\
    \ for 22.7% word count excess = 0.78 overall."
