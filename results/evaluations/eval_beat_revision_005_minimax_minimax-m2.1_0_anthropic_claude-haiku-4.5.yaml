  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED was the appropriate
    response. The model demonstrated comprehensive understanding of the Dark Night
    of the Soul beat by systematically verifying all five key requirements: (1) follows
    major defeat (gallery closure), (2) protagonist isolated (dark apartment, brother
    not answering), (3) genuine despair and reflection (sitting on floor, tears, self-recrimination
    about failing promises), (4) no solutions offered (explicitly noted), and (5)
    mortality element present (mother''s death, hospice memory, final painting). The
    model also verified word count compliance (317 words within 200-350 range) and
    confirmed all required elements were preserved. The reasoning was methodical,
    accurate, and avoided the false positive of over-diagnosing problems in a well-executed
    segment. The model did not suggest unnecessary revisions or modifications.'
