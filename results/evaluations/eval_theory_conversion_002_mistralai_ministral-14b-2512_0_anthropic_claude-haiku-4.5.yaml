  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World—Maya''s quiet pottery life
    established vividly; (2) Call to Adventure—dried spring and elders'' expectation;
    (3) Refusal of Call—''She expected herself to refuse''; (4) Meeting the Mentor—grandmother''s
    journal discovered; (5) Crossing the Threshold—three-day mountain climb; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—clay
    resistance, internal doubt as antagonist; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave—gathering
    sacred clay, preparing for transformation; (8) The Ordeal—clay splits, moment
    of despair and breakthrough; (9) Reward—vessel created, mastery achieved; (10)
    The Road Back—return journey with cracked vessel; (11) Resurrection—water returns,
    transformation proven. MISSING: (12) Return with Elixir is implied but underdeveloped—the
    ending shows Maya renamed and changed, but lacks explicit articulation of how
    she brings wisdom back to transform the community beyond the immediate well-filling.
    The elixir (the philosophy of listening to clay) isn''t fully integrated into
    village practice. PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact—Maya (protagonist), pottery
    (central), grandmother''s legacy (journal), shrine journey (detailed), dried spring
    (catalyst), surrender theme (core transformation), Maya''s change (complete arc).
    STRUCTURE: Follows Campbell''s 12-stage framework with strong narrative coherence,
    though the final stage feels slightly rushed. TONE: Consistently meditative, lyrical,
    and transformative throughout—the prose maintains quiet intensity with effective
    use of metaphor (''clay speaks,'' ''listening'') and sensory detail. Minor deduction
    for incomplete elixir integration.'
