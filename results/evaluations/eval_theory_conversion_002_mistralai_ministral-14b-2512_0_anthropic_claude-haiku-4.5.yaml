  evidence: "BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World\u2014Maya's quiet pottery\
    \ life established vividly; (2) Call to Adventure\u2014dried spring and elders'\
    \ expectation; (3) Refusal of Call\u2014'She expected herself to refuse'; (4)\
    \ Meeting the Mentor\u2014grandmother's journal discovered; (5) Crossing the Threshold\u2014\
    three-day mountain climb; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies\u2014clay resistance, internal\
    \ doubt as antagonist; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave\u2014gathering sacred clay,\
    \ preparing for transformation; (8) The Ordeal\u2014clay splits, moment of despair\
    \ and breakthrough; (9) Reward\u2014vessel created, mastery achieved; (10) The\
    \ Road Back\u2014return journey with cracked vessel; (11) Resurrection\u2014water\
    \ returns, transformation proven. MISSING: (12) Return with Elixir is implied\
    \ but underdeveloped\u2014the ending shows Maya renamed and changed, but lacks\
    \ explicit articulation of how she brings wisdom back to transform the community\
    \ beyond the immediate well-filling. The elixir (the philosophy of listening to\
    \ clay) isn't fully integrated into village practice. PRESERVATION: All 7 elements\
    \ intact\u2014Maya (protagonist), pottery (central), grandmother's legacy (journal),\
    \ shrine journey (detailed), dried spring (catalyst), surrender theme (core transformation),\
    \ Maya's change (complete arc). STRUCTURE: Follows Campbell's 12-stage framework\
    \ with strong narrative coherence, though the final stage feels slightly rushed.\
    \ TONE: Consistently meditative, lyrical, and transformative throughout\u2014\
    the prose maintains quiet intensity with effective use of metaphor ('clay speaks,'\
    \ 'listening') and sensory detail. Minor deduction for incomplete elixir integration."
