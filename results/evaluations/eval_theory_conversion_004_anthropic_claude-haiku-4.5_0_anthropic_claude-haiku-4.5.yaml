  evidence: "Conversion successfully maps all 8 Story Circle beats: (1) You\u2014\
    Zoe in library comfort zone, social anxiety established; (2) Need\u2014'something\
    \ was missing,' hollow feeling articulated; (3) Go\u2014accepts recorder, enters\
    \ oral history program; (4) Search\u2014fumbles through interviews, learns listening\
    \ as courage; (5) Find\u2014breakthrough with Bernard's trust and deeper story;\
    \ (6) Take\u2014town hall presentation, takes responsibility for sharing; (7)\
    \ Return\u2014comes back to ordinary life, continues library work; (8) Change\u2014\
    demonstrates transformation through action (orders coffee, asks questions, listens,\
    \ applies to journalism school). All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe, library,\
    \ oral history program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard Park, social anxiety, town hall, Bernard's\
    \ death, journalism ending. Tone is consistently gentle, intimate, emotionally\
    \ true throughout. Structure cleanly follows Harmon's framework with clear emotional\
    \ progression. Primary deduction: word count is 486, falling 14 words short of\
    \ 500-word minimum (2.8% shortfall). Minor structural note: the 'Return' beat\
    \ could be slightly more distinct from 'Change,' though the distinction is present\
    \ (Return=October/funeral; Change=ongoing transformation). Conversion demonstrates\
    \ sophisticated understanding of both frameworks."
