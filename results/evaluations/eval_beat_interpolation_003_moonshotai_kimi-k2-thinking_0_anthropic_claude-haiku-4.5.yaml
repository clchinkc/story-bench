  evidence: 'All 4 required elements present: (1) Multiple station areas explored
    (Crew Quarters B, medical bay, Lab Seven corridor), (2) Clues discovered progressively
    (unauthorized research logs, empty cryo-chamber, quantum decay readings, non-baryonic
    matter traces), (3) Transformed crew encountered mysteriously (fractured silhouette,
    flickering figure, shimmer effects—identity unclear until later), (4) Obstacle
    overcome (containment breach, manual override challenge requiring physics recalibration).
    All must-not items avoided: data core not immediately found (discovered at end),
    crew doesn''t explain everything (only cryptic pointer given), mission continues
    (no abandonment), transformation unknown beforehand (Yuki discovers it through
    investigation). Character voice remains consistent—scientific, methodical, increasingly
    unsettled. Bridge seamless: BEFORE ends with arrival/mystery setup; GENERATED
    shows active search/adaptation; AFTER reveals findings. Setting continuity perfect:
    same station, red emergency lighting maintained, spatial logic consistent (Crew
    Quarters→medical bay→Lab Seven progression). Execution exemplifies Search beat:
    struggle against obstacles, incremental discovery, adaptation to impossible physics,
    active navigation of unfamiliar environment.'
