  evidence: All 8 target beats are clearly present and well-executed. 'You' is Zoe's
    library comfort. 'Need' is subtly implied by her hiding in stories, then explicitly
    by Ms. Okafor's program. 'Go' is her reluctant entry into the program. 'Search'
    is her struggle and eventual breakthrough with interviews. 'Find' is her understanding
    of listening and Bernard's trust. 'Take' is the town hall presentation and bearing
    Bernard's story. 'Return' is the summer ending and her continued visits. 'Change'
    is her application to journalism school and new perspective. All 8 core elements
    are preserved. The word count is within range. The structural accuracy is excellent,
    mapping the Hero's Journey stages effectively to the Story Circle. The tone is
    perfectly maintained as gentle, intimate, and emotionally true.
