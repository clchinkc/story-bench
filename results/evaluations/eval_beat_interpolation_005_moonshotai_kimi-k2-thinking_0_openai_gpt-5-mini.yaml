  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Alejandro reveals a vulnerable
    truth (his mother/grief), the relationship shifts to personal, a shared cooking
    moment creates genuine connection, and Maya makes an explicit emotional commitment
    beyond pay. The scene functions strongly as a Midpoint—stakes rise and Maya moves
    from transactional to personally invested. Characters remain consistent with Act
    1, and setting details (kitchen, villa, sea) are continuous. The only deduction:
    word_count_valid is false per the provided check (word_count=1148), which falls
    outside the required 300–450 range.'
