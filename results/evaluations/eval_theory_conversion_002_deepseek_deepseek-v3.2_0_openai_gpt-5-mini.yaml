  evidence: 'All 12 Campbell beats are present and clearly identifiable. All 7 required
    elements are preserved (Maya protagonist, pottery focus, grandmother''s legacy/journal,
    mountain shrine journey, dried spring problem, theme of surrendering control,
    Maya''s transformation). Small deductions: the ''Meeting the Mentor'' occurs at
    the shrine after the Crossing/Tests rather than before the Crossing (a minor sequence
    shift from the canonical placement), hence a slight structural deduction. Tone
    is tightly maintained (quiet, meditative, transformative) with only minimal moments
    of more active language, so a small deduction applied.'
