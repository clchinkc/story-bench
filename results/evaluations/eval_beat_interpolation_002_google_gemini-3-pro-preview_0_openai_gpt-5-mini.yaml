  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: she considers recanting (survival
    instinct), considers official channels (call it in, tactical team), wrestles with
    duty vs. saving her sister (badge as target, moral dilemma), and a conversation
    with Marcus crystallizes her choice to operate outside the system. No forbidden
    elements appear: she does not immediately go rogue (debate precedes decision),
    no one else makes the decision or solves the problem, she has not resigned yet,
    and there''s no direct confrontation with Marchetti or his people. Tone and actions
    remain consistent and the beat cleanly leads into the Break into Two.'
