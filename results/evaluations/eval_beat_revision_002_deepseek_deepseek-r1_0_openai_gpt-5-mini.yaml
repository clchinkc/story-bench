  evidence: 'The model addressed the correct flaw: the original segment lacked a true
    ''All Is Lost'' moment. The revision removes remaining options (fundraiser permit
    canceled, grant rejected), strips support (Denise resigns and leaves, board can’t
    meet quorum), introduces personal stakes (family co-signed loan, risk of losing
    their home) and a ''whiff of death'' (the center as a ghost, Marcus isolated and
    defeated). All four required elements were preserved (Marcus protagonist; community
    center/youth program; eviction crisis; Denise present), and all four required
    phrases appear verbatim or effectively intact. Changes were not surgical but were
    conservative—opening lines and key beats retained while adding decisive events
    and emotional fallout—hence a moderate-to-high minimal_change_score (0.7). Writing
    quality is strong and coherent with no major errors; the beat reads as a convincing
    low point.'
