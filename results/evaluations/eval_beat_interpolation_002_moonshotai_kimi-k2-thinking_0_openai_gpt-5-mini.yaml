  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: recanting considered, going to
    authorities discussed, clear duty-vs-sister internal conflict, and a tipping conversation
    with Marcus that leads Sarah to choose the off-the-books option. The beat cleanly
    performs the Debate function and bridges into Break Into Two. No forbidden elements
    appear. Minor continuity deduction for a small timeline mismatch (Debate says
    ''seventy-two hours'' while the subsequent beat states ''seventy hours'').'
