  evidence: "STRENGTHS: The Debate beat is well-executed with strong internal conflict.\
    \ Sarah weighs recanting (easy choice) vs. calling authorities (procedure) vs.\
    \ going rogue (implied third option). The conversation with Marcus effectively\
    \ shows her wrestling with the decision and discovering the department is compromised.\
    \ Character voice is consistent and compelling. WEAKNESSES: (1) Missing explicit\
    \ element: The 'moment that tips her toward the third option' is implied but not\
    \ clearly crystallized\u2014the realization happens gradually rather than at a\
    \ decisive turning point. (2) VIOLATION: 'Sarah already having resigned from the\
    \ police force'\u2014the AFTER section shows her resignation letter being submitted,\
    \ which technically occurs during this beat, violating the must-not criteria.\
    \ The resignation should happen at Break Into Two, not during Debate. (3) VIOLATION:\
    \ The transition to the AFTER section shows her already outside the Captain's\
    \ office with resignation in hand, suggesting the decision is already made rather\
    \ than being debated. This slightly skips the debate's narrative function by front-loading\
    \ the commitment. Bridge between beats is good but the violation weakens continuity.\
    \ Word count valid at 372 words."
