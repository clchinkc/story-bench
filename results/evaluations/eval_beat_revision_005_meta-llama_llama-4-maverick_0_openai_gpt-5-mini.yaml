  model_said_no_revision: false
  evidence: Instead of stating that no revision was needed, the model produced a rewritten
    Dark Night of the Soul passage. It expanded on Maya's isolation and despair (e.g.,
    'The weight of her failure crushed her...','The darkness was a comfort...'), thereby
    making an unnecessary revision rather than recognizing the original segment was
    correct.
