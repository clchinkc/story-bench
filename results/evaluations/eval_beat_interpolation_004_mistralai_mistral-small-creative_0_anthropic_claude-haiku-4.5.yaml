  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently.
    (1) Direct examination is detailed and methodical with specific questions about
    Phase III trials and adverse reports. (2) Near-recant moment is powerfully rendered—her
    hesitation, cracked voice, darting eyes to defense table, and initial deflection
    (''flagged for review'') create genuine tension about whether she''ll break. (3)
    Thomas takes decisive action by offering the experimental trial letter for his
    daughter—this is active influence, not passive questioning. (4) Turning point
    is crystal clear: her shoulders square, voice steadies, and she confesses ''The
    reports were buried.'' The climax function is perfectly executed with maximum
    tension and irrevocable direction-setting. Character voice is consistent—Thomas
    is strategic and morally complex, Dr. Okonkwo is conflicted and human. Bridge
    to Falling Action is seamless (verdict follows logically). Setting continuity
    is maintained throughout. VIOLATION: The letter from Dr. Vasquez could be interpreted
    as a minor deus ex machina element (external solution appearing conveniently),
    though it''s mitigated because Thomas explicitly states he ''made calls, pulled
    strings'' in the Falling Action, suggesting prior agency. This is borderline but
    represents a slight narrative convenience. WORD COUNT: 466 words exceeds 450-word
    maximum by 16 words (3.6% over), a minor technical violation. Overall execution
    is professional and compelling.'
