  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Marcus is introduced as the mentor,
    he provides practical wisdom and tools (compass, herbs, pouch), Elena''s doubt
    shifts (''no longer entirely refusal''), and her librarian skills are reframed
    as useful. All ''must not'' conditions are avoided. Character voice and behavior
    are consistent with the ''BEFORE'' beat. The transition from refusal to reluctant
    acceptance is well-handled, and the setting continuity is maintained.'
