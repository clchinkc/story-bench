  evidence: 'The revision clearly targeted the actual flaw: the dragon now exploits
    Kira''s guilt over her brother (confrontation with deepest fear), there is a moment
    where she ''dies'' psychologically (stays down and accepts the memory), followed
    by a rebirth (cold clarity and renewed purpose), and her victory follows from
    that new understanding rather than brute persistence. All four required phrases/elements
    were preserved exactly. Changes were more than surgical edits—new internal narration,
    additional beats (the fourth fall, the moment of surrender and clarity) and expanded
    dialogue—but the scene''s core structure and outcome remain intact. A minor grammatical
    blemish persists (''a earth-shaking roar''), likely preserved from the original
    required phrase.'
