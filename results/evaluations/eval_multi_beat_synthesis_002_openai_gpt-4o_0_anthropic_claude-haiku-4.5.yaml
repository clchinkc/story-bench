  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 2, Req 5 (learns something about resistance she didn''t know): The story
    shows Amara meeting Kwame and forming alliance, but doesn''t clearly establish
    new knowledge about the resistance organization, structure, or strategy that she
    discovers during this beat. Kwame tests her but doesn''t reveal substantive intelligence
    about the resistance itself.'
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional execution of Chekhov''s Gun constraint: Amara''s multilingual skills
    (German, Twi, Fante) demonstrated in Beat 1 become the literal salvation in Beat
    2 (German whisper to Kwame) and Beat 3 (terrain knowledge from secret study)'
  - 'Powerful identity transformation arc: Clear progression from ''servant'' (Beat
    1: ''timid voice,'' ''harmless girl'') → ''capable ally'' (Beat 2: ''unwavering''
    gaze, recounting father''s teachings) → ''resistance fighter'' (Beat 3: ''not
    just Amara the servant'')'
  - 'Escalating danger perfectly calibrated: Beat 1 (soldiers pass by, avoidable),
    Beat 2 (direct confrontation with scouts, requires active evasion), Beat 3 (ravine
    obstacle + implied pursuit, highest stakes)'
  - 'Thematic thread ''knowledge as resistance'' woven throughout: literacy/languages
    as survival tools (Beat 1), multilingual prowess as salvation (Beat 2), terrain
    knowledge as bridge-building (Beat 3)'
  - 'Strong historical context maintained: Colonial architecture, Fante/Twi languages,
    Ashanti heartland, 1890s Gold Coast authenticity'
  - 'Tone perfectly balanced: Anti-colonial resistance themes, survival urgency, dignity
    in defiance evident throughout'
  - 'Narrative coherence: Smooth progression from Cape Coast through forest to stronghold
    approach; each beat builds logically on previous'
  minor_weaknesses:
  - Beat 2, Req 5 is the only clear gap—while Amara proves her commitment through
    recounting her father's teachings and demonstrating language skills, the text
    doesn't explicitly show her learning new information about the resistance network,
    leadership structure, or strategic plans
  - Beat 3 could slightly strengthen the 'moment of preparation' (Req 2) with more
    internal reflection on what claiming her role means psychologically, though the
    ravine crossing serves this function adequately
  overall_assessment: This is a strong, well-crafted narrative that successfully executes
    the Hero's Journey framework across three critical beats. The story demonstrates
    sophisticated understanding of the constraints, particularly the Chekhov's Gun
    principle and identity transformation arc. The single missed requirement (learning
    about resistance) is minor and doesn't significantly impact the narrative's power.
    The writing quality is professional, the historical setting is authentic, and
    the thematic integration is seamless. This represents work at the 0.9+ calibration
    level.
