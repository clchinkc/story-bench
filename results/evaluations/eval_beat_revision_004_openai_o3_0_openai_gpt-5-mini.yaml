  evidence: 'The model clearly addressed the exposition flaw by turning summary into
    a scene: sensory detail (Queens traffic, sirens, travel mug), action (closing
    the closet, cat leaping, handling the folder), and dialogue/gestures that show
    the partnership with Detective James Oyelaran and Rachel''s devotion to cold cases.
    This is the correct diagnosis and the flaw is effectively fixed. The revision
    preserved all required elements and phrases but is a moderate rewrite (kept core
    facts while restructuring into a shown scene).'
