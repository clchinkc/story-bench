  evidence: All 12 Campbell beats appear in correct sequence and are explicitly enacted
    (Ordinary World through Return with the Elixir). All 7 required elements (Maya,
    pottery, grandmother's legacy, mountain shrine journey, dried spring problem,
    theme of surrendering control, Maya's transformation) are present. Tone remains
    quiet, meditative, and transformative throughout. No deductions necessary.
