  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The output clearly
    functions as a Debate beat, showing Sarah's internal struggle and consideration
    of options before committing to a new path. All 'must not' items were successfully
    avoided. Character and continuity are strong, and the bridge to the next beat
    is seamless.
