  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Sarah contemplates recanting,
    considers going to authorities (through Marcus''s suggestion), shows clear internal
    conflict between duty and saving her sister, and a conversation with Marcus tips
    her toward committing to a third option. The scene performs the Debate beat properly
    by showing wrestling and ending in commitment without skipping the conflict. None
    of the prohibited items occur (no pre-existing resignation, no someone else deciding
    for her, no direct confrontation with Marchetti, and the decision follows a genuine
    debate rather than bypassing it).'
