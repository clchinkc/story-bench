  evidence: "The model addressed the actual flaw (lack of visible change on Return)\
    \ by having Sophie articulate a retreat lesson ('learned to sit with discomfort'),\
    \ demonstrating changed behavior (leaves phone in bag, deep breath, puts phone\
    \ in airplane mode, declines to handle work until tomorrow), and giving a visible\
    \ contrast with her old self (mother's surprise, explicit 'old Sophie' comparison,\
    \ noticing city differently). All four required elements and required phrases\
    \ are preserved; changes are moderate\u2014not a complete rewrite but more than\
    \ purely surgical edits\u2014to add the transformation beats and emotional detail."
