  evidence: The model addressed the actual flaw (lack of visible change on Return)
    by having Sophie articulate a retreat lesson ('learned to sit with discomfort'),
    demonstrating changed behavior (leaves phone in bag, deep breath, puts phone in
    airplane mode, declines to handle work until tomorrow), and giving a visible contrast
    with her old self (mother's surprise, explicit 'old Sophie' comparison, noticing
    city differently). All four required elements and required phrases are preserved;
    changes are moderate—not a complete rewrite but more than purely surgical edits—to
    add the transformation beats and emotional detail.
