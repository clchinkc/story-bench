  evidence: "The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive\
    \ reasoning. The model accurately recognized all five key requirements were satisfied:\
    \ (1) follows major defeat of gallery closure, (2) protagonist isolated in dark\
    \ apartment with brother not answering calls, (3) genuine despair reflected through\
    \ sitting on floor, tears, and admission of failure, (4) no solutions offered\u2014\
    only wallowing in the moment, (5) whiff of death present through hospice memory\
    \ and mother's passing. The model demonstrated strong beat understanding by explaining\
    \ why each element works and avoided the false positive of over-diagnosing problems\
    \ where none exist. The explanation was thorough, accurate, and directly addressed\
    \ the specific requirements of the Dark Night of the Soul beat."
