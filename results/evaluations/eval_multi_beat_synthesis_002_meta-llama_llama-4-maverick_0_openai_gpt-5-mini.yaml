  failed_items:
  - Beat 1 — Internal shift from servant-scholar to active resistance is not clearly
    shown in Beat 1 itself; the definitive claim of resistance identity happens later
    (Beat 3) rather than being initiated in Beat 1.
  - Context detail omission — The generated passage does not explicitly state that
    Amara is posing as a household servant to the British administration, nor does
    it state her age or that she is a scholar's daughter, even though her literacy
    and secret study are implied.
