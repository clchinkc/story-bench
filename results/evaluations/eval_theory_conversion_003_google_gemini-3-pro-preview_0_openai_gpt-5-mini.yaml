  evidence: "All four three-act beats are clearly present: Act I (office, letter,\
    \ departure to Kyoto), Act II-A (village acclimation, learning from Haruki, rising\
    \ stakes), Act II-B (business offer as midpoint/temptation, Yuki's rejection as\
    \ escalation/\u2019all is lost\u2019), Act III (reconciliation at the shrine,\
    \ denouement with the bamboo shop). All eight required elements are preserved.\
    \ Small structural deduction (0.1) because a couple of turning points are slightly\
    \ compressed/implicit (the precise delineation of midpoint vs. second plot point\
    \ is usable but not sharply signposted). Tone deduction (0.05) only for a few\
    \ modern phrasings; overall the quiet, Japanese aesthetic and redemptive mood\
    \ are very well maintained. Word count flag set false per provided constraint\
    \ (requested 765, which is outside the 550\u2013750 range)."
