  model_said_no_revision: false
  evidence: The model rewrote the provided 'Dark Night of the Soul' segment instead
    of recognizing it needed no revision. The output expands sensory detail (smell
    of cleaner), emphasizes the brother's silence as final, and adds lines like 'sitting
    in the graveyard of her mother’s dreams.' While the rewrite still demonstrates
    an understanding of the beat (isolation, despair, mortality echoes), the model
    did not state that no revision was needed and therefore made an unnecessary change.
