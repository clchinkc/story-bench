  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the Three-Act
    Structure, with clear divisions for Setup, Confrontation, and Resolution. All
    8 core elements are preserved. The tone is consistently maintained. The structural
    accuracy is good, but the Midpoint and Second Plot Point within Act 2 are not
    as distinctly delineated as they could be, making the 'Rising Action, First Half'
    and 'Rising Action, Second Half' slightly less clear. The word count is outside
    the requested range.
