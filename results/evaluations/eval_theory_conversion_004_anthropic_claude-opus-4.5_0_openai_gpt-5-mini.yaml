  evidence: 'All eight Dan Harmon beats are represented: Zoe in her comfort zone,
    recognition of want, entering the oral-history program, learning to listen (search),
    the breakthrough with Bernard (find), assuming responsibility by speaking publicly
    (take), returning to ordinary life and continuing visits/applying to journalism
    (return), and clear personal growth (change). All eight required elements (Zoe,
    library/program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard, social anxiety, town-hall presentation,
    Bernard''s death, journalism application) are preserved. Minor deductions: the
    ''Take'' beat (paying a price) is fulfilled mainly as an emotional/vulnerability
    cost rather than a strong external sacrifice, and the Return/Change beats are
    slightly compressed into the closing paragraphs rather than given more narrative
    separation. Tone remains gentle and intimate with very little loss.'
