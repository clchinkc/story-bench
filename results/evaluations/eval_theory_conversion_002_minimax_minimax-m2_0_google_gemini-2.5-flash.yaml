  evidence: The story successfully incorporates all 12 beats of the Hero's Journey
    and preserves all 7 core elements. The tone is perfectly maintained. The structural
    accuracy is good, but some beats feel slightly stretched or combined in a way
    that isn't perfectly crisp (e.g., 'Tests, Allies, Enemies' is a bit diffuse, and
    'Reward' feels a little less distinct from 'Ordeal' than it could be). The word
    count is outside the requested range.
