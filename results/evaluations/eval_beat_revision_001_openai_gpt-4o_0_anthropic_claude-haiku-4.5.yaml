  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated\
    \ The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis. The revision\
    \ addresses the actual flaw by: (1) Adding the dragon's exploitation of Kira's\
    \ guilt over her brother's death ('just as you failed to save your brother'),\
    \ (2) Creating a symbolic death moment ('abyss of despair' where 'all hope seemed\
    \ lost'), (3) Introducing transformation through internal realization ('newfound\
    \ clarity,' 'deeper understanding of her own resilience'), (4) Connecting victory\
    \ to insight rather than mere persistence ('fueled by newfound clarity'). PRESERVATION:\
    \ All 4 required phrases are present: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the\
    \ chasm' (exact), 'The creature was massive\u2014twenty feet of obsidian scales\
    \ and burning eyes' (exact), '\"You cannot defeat me, child,\" the dragon rumbled'\
    \ (exact with expansion), 'The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar'\
    \ (exact). All 4 story elements preserved: Shadow Dragon antagonist, Kira protagonist\
    \ with sword, brother's death reference, victorious outcome. MINIMAL CHANGES:\
    \ The revision is NOT minimally surgical\u2014approximately 60% of the original\
    \ text was rewritten or substantially expanded. The model added 2 full paragraphs\
    \ of internal reflection and psychological depth, restructured the battle description,\
    \ and added the brother's voice echo. While these changes effectively fix the\
    \ flaw, they exceed 'minimal surgical edits' and approach moderate-to-substantial\
    \ revision. QUALITY: Writing is strong with no new errors. The psychological depth\
    \ is well-executed. The brother's voice callback is effective. Minor: 'an earth-shaking\
    \ roar' should be 'a earth-shaking roar' (article error in original preserved).\
    \ The ending paragraph ('She retrieved her sword...') feels slightly rushed and\
    \ could be tighter. Overall execution of The Ordeal beat is solid\u2014fear confrontation\
    \ is clear, death moment is present, transformation is evident, and victory flows\
    \ from insight."
