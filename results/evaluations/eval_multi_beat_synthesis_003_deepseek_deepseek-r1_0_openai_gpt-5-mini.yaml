  failed_items:
  - word_count below required range (503 words; required 700-1000).
  - "Team friction / trust issues in Beat 3 are present but only lightly developed\u2014\
    limited substantive conflict shown beyond panic and terse commands."
  - Some transitions between beats feel abrupt due to the short length; additional
    connective moments would strengthen tonal escalation and character beats.
