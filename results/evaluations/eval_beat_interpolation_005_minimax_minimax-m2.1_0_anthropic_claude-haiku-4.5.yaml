  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently:
    (1) Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability through the saffron rice memory
    and his admission ''I don''t know anymore''; (2) Relationship shifts from professional
    distance (''efficient, proper, invisible'') to personal intimacy (sitting across
    table, using his name); (3) Shared moment of genuine connection when he closes
    his eyes and reveals his mother''s memory; (4) Maya makes explicit commitment
    choice (''I''m not leaving'') that transcends the contract (''no longer working
    for the salary''). The beat perfectly executes Act 2 Midpoint function—Maya moves
    from reactive (following guidelines) to proactive (choosing vulnerability), raising
    emotional stakes and creating point of no return. All must-not items avoided:
    they''re not in love yet (connection is nascent), Maya doesn''t leave, photograph
    isn''t taken here, Alejandro''s wall genuinely lowers. Character voices consistent—Maya''s
    thoughtful introspection, Alejandro''s guarded vulnerability. Seamless bridge
    from BEFORE (contract signing) through GENERATED (emotional breakthrough) to AFTER
    (photograph scandal). Setting continuity perfect (kitchen→table→study). ONLY ISSUE:
    Word count 704 exceeds 450-word maximum by 254 words (56% over limit). This is
    a significant technical violation despite narrative excellence.'
  overall_assessment: Exceptional narrative execution of the Act 2 Midpoint beat with
    perfect character work, emotional arc, and thematic resonance. However, substantial
    word count violation (704 vs. 450 max) prevents highest composite score.
