  evidence: 'All four required elements present: (1) Marcus introduced as former adventurer
    mentor with clear characterization; (2) practical wisdom provided through reframing
    librarian skills as applicable to forest navigation, plus tangible tools (satchel,
    compass); (3) Elena''s doubt shifts from ''I can''t do this'' to reluctant acceptance
    (''settling into something manageable''); (4) librarian skills explicitly validated
    as ''the only things that will keep you from losing your way.'' All must-not violations
    avoided: Elena remains doubtful and unconfident (''still felt spectacularly unqualified''),
    Marcus provides guidance but no accompaniment, setting is curiosity shop (not
    forest), no magical powers discovered. Character voice maintains Elena''s self-deprecating
    librarian perspective while showing subtle shift. Bridge seamlessly connects refusal
    beat to threshold beat through mentor''s reframing. Continuity perfect: map, grandmother''s
    ghost, Elena''s profession all consistent with prior beat. Execution exemplary—Marcus
    embodies the mentor archetype without solving problems, instead equipping Elena
    with perspective and tools she must use herself.'
