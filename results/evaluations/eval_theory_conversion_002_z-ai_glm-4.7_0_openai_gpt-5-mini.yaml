  evidence: 'All 12 Campbell beats are present and all 7 core elements are preserved.
    Deduction from perfect structural accuracy (0.9) for a minor ordering/placement
    issue: the ‘Meeting the Mentor’ (grandmother’s journal) occurs after the Crossing
    the Threshold in the narrative rather than before it in the traditional beat order;
    also there are no explicit allies introduced (tests/enemies are present). Tone
    fully matches the requested quiet, meditative, transformative quality.'
