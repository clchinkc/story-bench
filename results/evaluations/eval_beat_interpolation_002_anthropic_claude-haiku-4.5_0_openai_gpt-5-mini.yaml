  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: consideration of recanting, exploring
    official protection channels, clear internal duty-vs-sister conflict, and a tipping
    conversation/realization (with Marcus) leading to the rogue option. No prohibited
    items appear (no immediate rogue action, no one else makes the decision, she has
    not resigned here, no direct confrontation). Character behavior and setting remain
    consistent, and the scene cleanly bridges into the subsequent Break Into Two.'
