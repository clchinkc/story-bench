  evidence: The story successfully incorporates all 12 beats of the Hero's Journey
    and preserves all 7 core elements. The tone is perfectly maintained. The structural
    accuracy is good, though some beats like 'Meeting the Mentor' and 'Tests, Allies,
    Enemies' are integrated more subtly than distinct stages. The word count is significantly
    over the requested range.
