  evidence: 'All eight Dan Harmon beats are present and in clear sequence: Zoe''s
    comfort zone, recognition of a need, entering the oral-history program, learning/adapting
    through practice, the breakthrough with Bernard, taking responsibility by presenting
    at town hall, returning to ordinary life (including Bernard''s funeral), and visible
    change (applying to journalism/speaking publicly). All eight required elements
    (Zoe, library/program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard, social anxiety, town hall, Bernard''s
    death, journalism application) are preserved. Minor note: the ''Take'' beat''s
    cost is emotional/risk-based rather than physical or punitive, but that still
    satisfies the step within the story''s gentle, intimate tone.'
