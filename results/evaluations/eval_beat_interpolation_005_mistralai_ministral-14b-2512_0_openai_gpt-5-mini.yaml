  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Maya discovers Alejandro's vulnerability\
    \ (scars, ritual with wine and blood), their relationship shifts from professional\
    \ to personal, there is a clear shared connective moment (wine/blood ritual and\
    \ conversation), and Maya chooses to stay emotionally beyond the contract. The\
    \ scene clearly functions as a midpoint commitment, raising stakes and shifting\
    \ Maya to proactive emotional investment. No prohibited items appear (no pre-existing\
    \ love declaration, no contract breach, no photograph, and Alejandro softens rather\
    \ than remaining closed). Word count is outside the requested 300\u2013450 range,\
    \ so word_count_valid is false. Minor deduction in character_score for slightly\
    \ melodramatic/overly sensual detail that risks feeling excessive (hence 0.9 rather\
    \ than 1.0); bridge and continuity are strong and well-handled."
