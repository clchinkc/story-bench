  evidence: 'The model addressed the correct flaw — Sophie returns changed — by having
    her remember a breathing practice, choose not to respond immediately, and physically
    power off the phone, then look out the window and perceive the city as less overwhelming.
    These actions show an applied lesson from the retreat and a visible behavioral
    marker (changed relationship with her phone/work). Changes were minimal and surgical:
    the original lines and structure were preserved and four required phrases remained
    intact. One small omission: the revision does not explicitly show Sophie''s mother
    noticing the difference, so not every recommended element was included.'
