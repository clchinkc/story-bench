  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas (quarters,
    mess hall, labs), discovers clues (log entry, abandoned items), encounters transformed
    crew (flicker, distortion), and overcomes an obstacle (locked door). All ''must
    not'' items are avoided. The narrative clearly executes the ''Search'' beat by
    showing Yuki actively investigating and facing challenges without immediate resolution.
    Character and setting continuity are excellent, and the bridge between beats is
    smooth.'
