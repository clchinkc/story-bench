  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: direct examination, a near-recant
    moment, a decisive action by Thomas that influences Okonkwo, and a clear turning
    point where she confesses and truth prevails. None of the prohibited items occur—Okonkwo
    struggles internally before confessing, Thomas is active and decisive, the defense
    does not win, and there is no extraneous deus ex machina (Thomas''s intervention
    is an action by the protagonist, not an unexplained external miracle). Setting
    and character behavior remain consistent, and the scene cleanly bridges the provided
    before and after beats.'
