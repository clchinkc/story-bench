  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true ''All Is Lost'' moment. It addressed all aspects of the flaw: the fundraiser
    and grant failed, Denise (a support system) betrayed him, his wife left him (personal
    loss/betrayal), and he genuinely gives up hope, with the ''whiff of death'' being
    the metaphorical death of the center and his purpose. The changes were significant
    enough to fix the flaw but still retained the core elements and several required
    phrases, indicating a good balance between fixing the problem and preserving the
    original structure.'
