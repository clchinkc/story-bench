  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment lacked the internal,
    transformative aspects of The Ordeal. It introduced the dragon exploiting Kira's
    guilt over her brother's death, created a 'symbolic death' moment where guilt
    consumes her, and then a 'rebirth' where she gains self-forgiveness and new understanding.
    This directly addresses all points of the actual flaw and the required fix. The
    changes were significant enough to fix the flaw but still retained much of the
    original structure and action. One required phrase was slightly altered ('The
    Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar' became 'The Shadow Dragon collapsed
    with a earth-shaking roar. Kira stood over its body, victorious but transformed...'),
    but the core phrase is there.
