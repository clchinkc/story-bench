  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-sequenced.
    Exposition establishes Samira''s 15-year reputation and comfortable world before
    the anomaly. Rising Action spans the 72-hour investigation with escalating obstacles
    (evolving pathogen, body count, time pressure). Climax peaks at the Nexus revelation
    and confrontation moment (''The revelation slammed into her like a tidal wave'').
    Falling Action depicts the press conference showdown and immediate consequences.
    Denouement provides equilibrium shift with career sacrifice and ethical resolution.
    All 6 core elements preserved: protagonist (Samira), engineered virus discovery,
    Raj''s supporting role, Nexus antagonist, public cure release, career sacrifice.
    Tone maintains medical thriller tension throughout with ethical weight (''every
    test result now imbued with knowledge that an unseen hand had tampered''). MINOR
    DEDUCTIONS: Structural accuracy -0.05 because the climax moment could be more
    sharply defined as a single turning point rather than distributed across the Nexus
    confrontation section. Tone -0.1 because some passages lean slightly toward melodrama
    (''tidal wave,'' ''boiling cauldron'') rather than maintaining clinical thriller
    restraint consistently. Word count exactly 640 (valid). Conversion successfully
    transforms 3-act linear progression into 5-stage pyramid architecture with proper
    escalation and denouement.'
