  failed_constraints:
  - word_count outside required range (492 words; required 500-700)
  - No explicit moment where Zara must choose between escaping safely and helping
    Tomás
  - No trap/test that clearly requires Zara to use her thief skills (lockpicking,
    disabling traps, stealthful bypass, etc.)
  - No clear revelation about Tomás's true motivation for helping (only hinted as
    'vested interest')
  - Zara does not explicitly confront her fear of failure (the text shows determination
    but not confrontation of failure-related fear)
  - No symbolic death/rebirth moment during the Ordeal
  - Ordeal is underdeveloped—while an emergency occurs (Tomás nearly falls) it is
    not rendered as a full crucible, so the ending requirement is only partially satisfied
    (Zara shows some change but the new complication is not clearly presented)
