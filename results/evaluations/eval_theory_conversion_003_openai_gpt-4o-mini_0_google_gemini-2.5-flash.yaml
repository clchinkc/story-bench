  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the Three-Act
    Structure, hitting all target beats and preserving all specified elements. The
    structural accuracy is good, but the 'First Plot Point' and 'Second Plot Point'
    transitions could be slightly more distinct. The tone is well-maintained, though
    some phrasing could be slightly more subtle to fully capture the 'quiet drama'
    aspect.
