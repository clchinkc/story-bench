  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation
    and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.
    The revision fixes this precisely by: (1) demonstrating changed behavior—Sophie
    silences her phone and consciously chooses NOT to respond to work emergencies,
    directly contrasting her pre-journey self; (2) integrating a specific insight
    (''the stillness was what I really needed'') that she applies; (3) showing physical
    markers of change (silencing phone, putting it away, not quickening pulse); (4)
    providing clear contrast through the mother''s expectation of ''frantic response''
    versus Sophie''s calm choice; (5) having the mother notice something different
    (''her grip tightening slightly on the steering wheel as she braced for Sophie''s
    usual frantic response''—implying surprise at the change). All 4 required phrases
    are preserved exactly or near-exactly: ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare''
    (exact), ''How was Thailand?'' her mother asked'' (exact), ''The familiar Chicago
    skyline appeared'' (exact), ''''It''s good to be home,'' she said'' (exact). Changes
    were surgical: the original work-obsession section (lines about scrolling emails,
    typing responses) was replaced with a meditation-informed response, and introspective
    passages were added showing her new perspective. The revision maintains all preserved
    elements (Sophie, Thailand retreat, Chicago return, mother, work pressure) while
    transforming how Sophie engages with them. Writing quality is professional with
    no new errors. The beat execution is nearly perfect—the only minor gap is that
    the mother''s observation could be slightly more explicit, but it''s clearly implied
    through her braced reaction.'
