  evidence: All eight Harmon beats are clearly present and in logical sequence. All
    eight required elements (Zoe, library/program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard, Zoe's social
    anxiety, town-hall, Bernard's death, journalism application) are preserved. A
    small deduction in structural_accuracy_score because the 'Take' beat reads as
    emotional responsibility/risk rather than a clearly costly sacrifice; it still
    functions narratively but is slightly less forceful as a 'pay the price' moment.
