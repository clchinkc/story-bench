  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to execute
    'All Is Lost' by leaving Marcus with too many options and support. The revision
    systematically removes all options (fundraiser, grant, board) and support systems
    (Denise, wife), introduces personal betrayal (Denise's new job), and a 'whiff
    of death' (Jamal's photo, the center being dismantled, wife leaving). The emotional
    tone is clearly 'rock bottom.' While the changes are significant to achieve the
    beat, they are focused on addressing the specific flaw, making them as minimal
    as possible given the extent of the required fix. All required phrases and elements
    are preserved, and the writing quality is excellent.
