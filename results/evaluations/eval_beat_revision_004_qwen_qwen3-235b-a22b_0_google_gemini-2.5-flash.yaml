  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' and revised it to demonstrate Rachel's traits and relationships
    through action, dialogue, and sensory details. It shows her dedication to cold
    cases, her dynamic with James, and her home life with Sherlock. The changes were
    extensive, essentially a rewrite, rather than minimal surgical edits, which is
    why minimal_change_score is low. However, the quality of the rewrite is high and
    it effectively fixes the identified flaw.
