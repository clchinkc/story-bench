  evidence: "Deductions: Missing a clear near-recant moment\u2014Dr. Okonkwo struggles\
    \ but does not come close to recanting, so one required element is absent (hence\
    \ 3/4 => 0.75). Execution downgraded to 0.80 for being generally effective but\
    \ somewhat generic and not fully dramatized around the pivotal hesitation. Character,\
    \ bridge, and continuity scores slightly reduced for minor stylistic bluntness;\
    \ all must-not items are avoided."
