  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Marcus had too many options
    and support systems intact, preventing a true ''All Is Lost'' beat. The revision
    systematically eliminates all escape routes: fundraiser failed (half the goal),
    grant denied, board dissolved, Denise leaves for another job, and wife files for
    divorce. The ''whiff of death'' is multi-layered—loss of identity (15 years of
    work), loss of support system (Denise, wife), and metaphorical death of his life''s
    purpose. DeShawn''s arrival crystallizes the hopelessness: Marcus has no answers
    for the kids he''s failed. All four required phrases preserved: ''Marcus stared
    at the eviction notice in his hands'' (exact), ''Thirty days to vacate the community
    center'' (exact), ''"There has to be something we can do," said Denise'' (exact),
    ''He rubbed his temples'' (exact). Denise remains in scene (preserved). Eviction
    notice and community center setting unchanged (preserved). Changes were not minimal—approximately
    50% of original text was replaced with new material (Denise''s job offer, divorce
    papers, DeShawn scene, internal monologue). However, the structural skeleton and
    key dialogue anchors remained, making this a moderate surgical revision rather
    than a complete rewrite. Writing quality is professional with strong emotional
    resonance, no grammatical errors, and effective use of sensory details (''hands
    went numb,'' ''voices echo,'' ''nothing came out''). The beat now fully satisfies
    Save the Cat requirements for All Is Lost.'
