  evidence: All four required elements are clearly present (multiple areas explored;
    clues discovered; mysterious transformed crew encountered; obstacles overcome).
    None of the forbidden items appear (no immediate discovery of the core or full
    explanation, no direct exposition from the transformed crew, no quitting, and
    Yuki did not already know about the transformation). Tone, behavior, and setting
    remain consistent and the excerpt cleanly bridges into the subsequent 'Find' beat.
