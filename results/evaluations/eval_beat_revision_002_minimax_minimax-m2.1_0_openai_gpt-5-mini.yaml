  evidence: The model addressed the correct problem (All Is Lost beat too mild) by
    introducing betrayal (Denise accepts Crawford's offer and leaves), personal loss/isolation
    (Marcus's wife leaves), and explicit exhaustion of options (fundraiser ‘would
    take weeks they didn't have,’ grant won’t come through in time, ‘every door...
    locked’). This creates the necessary 'whiff of death' (the family he built is
    gone) and leaves Marcus shattered. All four required elements and required phrases
    are preserved verbatim or as clear substrings. Changes are significant emotionally
    but structurally conservative—key lines and the scene remain intact—so edits are
    more than cosmetic but not a full rewrite.
