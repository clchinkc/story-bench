  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified the core flaw\u2014Sophie showed\
    \ no transformation and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns. The revision\
    \ demonstrates clear understanding that the Return beat requires behavioral change,\
    \ not just physical return. FLAW CORRECTION: Excellent execution. The revision\
    \ shows: (1) Sophie resisting work impulse ('fingers no longer twitching toward\
    \ her phone'), (2) Specific insight applied ('Linda's emergencies aren't real\
    \ emergencies'), (3) Physical markers of change (not checking emails, not pulling\
    \ out phone, lingering at airport), (4) Strong contrast (old Sophie vs. new Sophie's\
    \ priorities), (5) Mother noticing difference ('glanced at her'). All 5 required\
    \ elements present. PRESERVATION: All 4 required phrases preserved: 'Sophie's\
    \ flight landed at O'Hare' (exact), 'How was Thailand?' her mother asked' (exact),\
    \ 'The familiar Chicago skyline appeared' (exact), 'It's good to be home,' she\
    \ said' (exact). All 4 story elements maintained (Sophie, Thailand retreat, Chicago\
    \ return, work pressure). MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is a MODERATE-TO-SUBSTANTIAL\
    \ rewrite, not minimal surgical edits. Original was ~180 words; revision is 298\
    \ words. Approximately 60% new material added (airport lingering scene, meditation\
    \ insight dialogue, internal reflection). However, the additions are JUSTIFIED\
    \ because the original was fundamentally broken\u2014minimal edits couldn't fix\
    \ the flaw. The model chose expansion over constraint, which was the right call\
    \ for beat execution but violates the 'minimal modification' instruction. QUALITY:\
    \ Writing is strong\u2014vivid sensory details ('hum of the airport'), psychological\
    \ depth, natural dialogue. No errors. Tone shift from rushed to contemplative\
    \ is well-executed. Minor: The ending feels slightly over-written ('And life,\
    \ just maybe, could be too') but maintains thematic coherence."
