  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed all aspects of the 'All Is
    Lost' flaw. It eliminated all previous options (fundraiser canceled, grant rejected),
    introduced a personal loss/betrayal (Denise resigning), showed Marcus genuinely
    giving up hope, and included a 'whiff of death' (loss of identity/purpose, threat
    to family home). The changes were surgical and built upon the original text, maintaining
    the core structure and character elements. All required phrases were present,
    and the forbidden changes were avoided. The quality of writing is excellent, effectively
    conveying the intended emotional state.
