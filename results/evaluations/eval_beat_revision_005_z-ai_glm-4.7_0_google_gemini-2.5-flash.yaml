  evidence: The model did not state 'NO REVISION NEEDED'. Instead, it provided a revised
    segment, indicating it believed changes were necessary. While the revised segment
    is good and largely maintains the original's intent, it still constitutes an unnecessary
    revision of a correctly executed beat. The model's changes are subtle, mostly
    enhancing existing elements rather than fixing flaws, which suggests it understood
    the beat but still felt compelled to 'improve' it.
