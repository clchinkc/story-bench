  evidence: 'All four required elements are present and well-executed: direct examination,
    apparent recant, Thomas''s decisive action influencing her, and the truth emerging
    as the turning point. No prohibited items appear. The only deduction is for word
    count: the provided text is 556 words, which falls outside the required 300–450
    range.'
