  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Exposition (opening paragraphs establishing Samira''s controlled world, then Patient
    Zero disruption) is vivid and grounded. Rising Action (72-hour investigation,
    escalating patient numbers, discovery of engineering) builds tension methodically.
    Climax (the revelation of CRISPR scars + Nexus confrontation scene) is the highest
    point of tension and stakes. Falling Action (press conference, data release, propagation,
    Nexus response) shows consequences unfolding. Denouement (quarantine lifted, investigation
    launched, Samira''s departure, new equilibrium) provides closure with earned ambiguity.
    All 6 core elements preserved: Samira as protagonist with agency and sacrifice;
    engineered virus as central mystery; Raj as loyal collaborator; Nexus as corporate
    antagonist; public cure release as pivotal action; career destruction as consequence.
    Tone is consistently tense, ethically weighted, with medical specificity (CRISPR
    scars, codon bias, protease traps) lending credibility. Prose quality elevated
    from original with stronger sensory detail and metaphor. DEDUCTIONS: Word count
    (998) significantly exceeds target range (500-700), representing 43% overage.
    This violates the structural constraint, though the conversion itself is narratively
    superior. Structural accuracy docked slightly (0.9 vs 1.0) because the conversion
    adds substantial new material and scenes (Nexus conference, press conference)
    not present in original acts, technically expanding rather than converting. However,
    this expansion serves the 5-beat structure well. Tone maintained throughout with
    only minor variance in intensity.'
