  evidence: "All 12 Campbell beats are clearly present and ordered: Ordinary World\
    \ (teaching in village), Call (spring dries/dreams), Refusal (offers other potters/denial),\
    \ Meeting the Mentor (Sura and grandmother\u2019s journal), Crossing (leaves for\
    \ mountain), Tests/Allies/Enemies (weather, shepherd, doubts, cracked cup), Approach\
    \ to Inmost Cave (ruined shrine/kiln), Ordeal (struggle to surrender/control while\
    \ throwing), Reward (the finished vessel), Road Back (descent with vessel), Resurrection\
    \ (inner transformation as water returns), Return with Elixir (teaches differently,\
    \ spring restored). All 7 required elements are preserved (Maya, pottery, grandmother\u2019\
    s legacy, mountain shrine journey, dried spring, theme of surrendering control,\
    \ Maya\u2019s transformation). Tone is quiet and meditative throughout. The only\
    \ deduction is word_count_valid=false: the provided converted text exceeds the\
    \ specified 600\u2013800 word range (not within required limits). Minor note:\
    \ the Mentor role is distributed between Sura and the journal, but this still\
    \ satisfies the Meeting-the-Mentor stage."
