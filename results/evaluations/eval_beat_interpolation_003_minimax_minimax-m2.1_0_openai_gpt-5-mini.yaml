  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas
    (quarters, common area, office, med bay, corridors), discovers clues (Reyes''s
    notes on phase transitions, emergency reports, nurse''s cut-off entry), encounters
    transformed crew as mysterious shimmer/voices and life-signs in vents, and overcomes
    obstacles (pursuit, sealing blast doors) to reach Lab Seven. None of the forbidden
    items appear—the data core isn''t immediately obtained, the crew don''t directly
    explain events, she doesn''t choose to leave, and she didn''t already know about
    the dimensional transformation. Character behavior and setting continuity are
    consistent and the scene effectively bridges arrival to the subsequent data-core
    discovery.'
