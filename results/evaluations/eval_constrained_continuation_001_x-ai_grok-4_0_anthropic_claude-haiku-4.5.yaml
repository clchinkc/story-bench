  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'Approach to the Inmost Cave: Clearly marked (''Deeper they went, the Approach
      yielding to the Inmost Cave''s threshold'') with the sealed door and riddle
      mechanism'

      emergence into new complications'

      \ side vent escape opportunity"
    - "\u2713 Thief skills test: Bridge crossing with pressure plates requiring her\
      \ expertise to navigate"
    - "\u2713 Tom\xE1s's true motivation revealed: Confession about seeking the forbidden\
      \ text for family honor"
    - "\u2713 Fear of failure confrontation: Explicit internal monologue about failing\
      \ her mother and self-doubt"
    - "\u2713 Symbolic death/rebirth: Sand burial sequence with panic, thrashing,\
      \ and emergence as changed person"
    - "\u2713 Zara emerges changed: 'Zara emerged changed\u2014harder, her fear of\
      \ failure tempered into resolve'"
    must_not_detail:
    - "\u2713 No cure found: Library not yet accessed, quest incomplete"
    - "\u2713 No romantic subplot: Relationship remains pragmatic alliance with tension"
    - "\u2713 Tom\xE1s survives: Wounded but alive after bridge escape"
    - "\u2713 No supernatural abilities: All actions grounded in thief skills, cunning,\
      \ and physical capability"
    tone_assessment: Tense atmosphere maintained throughout with escalating danger.
      Morally complex choices presented (helping vs. escaping, trusting a deceiver).
      Desperate hope evident in mother's memory and determination. Minor deduction
      only for occasional exposition-heavy phrasing that slightly reduces tension.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect execution: Ordeal survived with symbolic transformation
      complete, but new complication introduced (Guild enforcers blocking the Library).
      Leaves reader with forward momentum and unresolved stakes.'
    critical_issue: Word count violation is the only constraint failure. At 914 words,
      the piece exceeds the 700-word maximum by 214 words (30% over). This is a hard
      constraint violation that cannot be overlooked despite otherwise exceptional
      execution.
  overall_score: 0.75
  score_justification: 'Exceptional narrative quality with perfect execution on all
    content requirements (beats, must-includes, must-nots, tone, ending). However,
    the word count violation (914 vs. 700 max) is a hard constraint that significantly
    impacts the final score. The story demonstrates masterful storytelling but fails
    to meet technical specifications. Score reflects: content excellence (1.0) weighted
    against constraint violation penalty (0.25 deduction for 30% overage).'
