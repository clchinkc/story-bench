  evidence: The scene includes consideration of official channels, internal duty-vs-family
    conflict, and a tipping moment that leads to commitment, but it does not explicitly
    show Sarah considering recanting her testimony (missing one required element).
    The beat otherwise functions as a Debate—she weighs options and commits—so execution
    is strong but slightly reduced by that omission. All four 'must not' items are
    avoided. Character behavior is consistent with prior setup, and the scene cleanly
    bridges to the subsequent Break Into Two with no continuity problems.
error: null
