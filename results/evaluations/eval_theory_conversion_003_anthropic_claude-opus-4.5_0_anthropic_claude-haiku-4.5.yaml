  evidence: 'All four target beats present and clearly delineated: Act 1 (office departure
    through train journey) establishes ordinary world and inciting incident; Act 2A
    (village arrival through harvest festival) develops obstacles and midpoint revelation;
    Act 2B (investor temptation through Yuki''s confrontation) escalates complications
    and second plot point; Act 3 (apology through bamboo shop) delivers climax and
    denouement. All 8 core elements preserved: Kenji protagonist, corporate loss,
    Yuki estrangement, Kyoto wedding, Haruki craftsman, business temptation, thematic
    choice, bamboo shop ending. Structure follows Aristotelian three-act theory with
    clear rising action, turning points, and resolution. Tone maintains quiet, contemplative
    Japanese aesthetic throughout with restrained emotional beats and sensory detail
    (cedar forests, woodsmoke, maple trees). Minor deduction from structural accuracy
    (0.05) due to slight ambiguity in exact midpoint placement—could argue it occurs
    at harvest festival or at investor arrival. Minor tone deduction (0.05) for occasional
    slightly more explicit emotional language than pure Japanese aesthetic might warrant,
    though overall restraint is excellent.'
