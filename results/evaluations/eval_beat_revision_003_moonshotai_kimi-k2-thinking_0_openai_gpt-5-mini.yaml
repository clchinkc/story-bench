  evidence: 'The revision directly targets the Return (Having Changed) flaw by showing
    Sophie behaving differently: she pauses before checking urgent work messages,
    explicitly references a lesson from the retreat (''respond, don''t react'' / ''the
    breath before action''), and physically slips the phone into her bag—clear behavioral
    and physical markers of change. Her mother notices (''That''s new.''). The text
    preserves all four required elements and phrases (airport arrival, mother asking
    ''How was Thailand?'', ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'', and ''"It''s
    good to be home," she said'') and retains the work-pressure plot point (Linda
    / Pearson account) while altering Sophie''s response. Changes are more than surgical
    but restrained—structure and beats are preserved with added lines to demonstrate
    transformation, so minimal_change_score is set at 0.8. Writing quality is high
    with smooth integration of the new beat, hence quality_score 0.9.'
