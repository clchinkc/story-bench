  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - ''Things going according to plan (mostly)'': The plan begins smoothly
    but Elena''s intervention happens too quickly; there''s insufficient runway showing
    the crew executing successfully before complications emerge. The complication
    (Elena''s presence) arrives before we see enough of the heist working.'
  - 'Beat 1 - ''Introduction of an unexpected complication (minor)'': While Elena''s
    appearance is a complication, it''s not minor—it''s catastrophic and belongs more
    to Beat 2/3. A minor complication would be a guard patrol, a sensor malfunction,
    or a guest interference. This skips the escalation structure.'
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional Chekhov''s Gun execution: The nitrogen cooling lines mentioned casually
    in dialogue become the critical solution in the climax. Setup-to-payoff is seamless
    and satisfying.'
  - 'Strong tonal escalation: Beat 1 opens with playful confidence (''wonderfully
    distracting,'' dry wit), Beat 2 shifts to shock and betrayal (''ruin,'' ''curated
    execution''), Beat 3 becomes gallows humor and survival (''Next time, we steal
    something less flammable'').'
  - 'Mentor presence perfectly calibrated: Elena is unknown in Beat 1 (only mentioned
    as security consultant), revealed with devastating impact in Beat 2 (the camera
    reveal), and becomes active antagonist in Beat 3 (forcing Miri''s impossible choice).'
  - 'Jax''s arc is consistent and consequential: Introduced as capable tech specialist,
    becomes trapped/vulnerable in Beat 2, forces Miri''s moral choice in Beat 3. His
    presence drives the plot, not just accompanies it.'
  - 'Context maintenance is excellent: Miri''s characterization (dry wit, meticulous,
    wrongfully accused but now actually stealing), Monaco setting, Ocean''s Eleven
    tone, and the moral complexity of stealing stolen art all shine through.'
  - 'The false victory in Beat 2 is well-executed: Vault opens, painting secured—then
    Elena appears and the entire situation inverts.'
  - 'Coherence is strong: Each beat flows logically into the next; the yacht setting
    allows for escalating physical danger (sealed doors, flooding, fire) that mirrors
    emotional stakes.'
  weaknesses:
  - 'Word count exceeds limit (1016 vs. 700-1000 max): 16 words over, minor but fails
    the constraint.'
  - 'Beat 1 pacing issue: The transition from ''plan humming'' to ''vault door hissed
    open'' compresses the Fun and Games beat. More moments of crew banter, problem-solving,
    or near-misses would strengthen the ''things going according to plan'' requirement
    before Elena''s reveal.'
  - 'Minor complication missing: The story jumps from smooth execution to catastrophic
    threat. A smaller obstacle (a guest blocking a corridor, a sensor glitch, a timing
    issue) in Beat 1 would better establish the escalation pattern.'
  - 'Elena''s motivation could be slightly clearer: Why does she want Miri caught
    specifically? Is it professional, personal, or contractual? The ''cover her own
    tracks'' reference hints at it but could be more explicit.'
  calibration_notes: 'This is a strong execution that satisfies 13/15 beat requirements
    and all 4 cross-beat constraints. The two missing requirements are both in Beat
    1 and relate to pacing/escalation structure rather than fundamental storytelling
    failure. The Chekhov''s Gun work is exemplary, tonal shifts are precise, and character
    arcs are meaningful. The word count violation is technical but noted. Overall,
    this lands in the 0.8-0.85 range (Good: fully satisfies requirements with only
    minor issues).'
