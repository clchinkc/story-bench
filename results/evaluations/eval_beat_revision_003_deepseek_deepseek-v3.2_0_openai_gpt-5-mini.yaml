  evidence: "The model addressed the actual flaw (lack of Return/Change) by showing\
    \ Sophie behaving differently: leaving her phone in her purse, articulating an\
    \ insight from the retreat ('urgency was often a choice' / 'learned to sit with\
    \ the quiet'), and explicitly choosing to delay work (contrasted with 'the old\
    \ Sophie would already be typing'). Her mother notices ('No work emails? That's\
    \ a first.'). All four required elements and four required phrases are preserved\
    \ with mostly surgical edits\u2014the structure and key beats remain while adding\
    \ just enough behavior and internalization to demonstrate change."
