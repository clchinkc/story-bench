  evidence: "The model addressed the actual flaw (exposition that was 'telling' rather\
    \ than 'showing') by converting the info-dump into a lived scene: sensory details\
    \ (muted trumpet, kettle, chipped mug, precinct lobby sounds) ground the Queens\
    \ apartment and precinct; Rachel's detective instincts are shown (spotting a staged\
    \ detail, circling it); her devotion is implied through the spread of case printouts,\
    \ the ring box in the junk drawer, and her practiced sequence with badge and holster;\
    \ the partnership with Detective James Oyelaran is revealed in action and dialogue\
    \ (two coffees, banter, passing the folder). The cat appears naturally (Sherlock,\
    \ the gray cat) and the time/frame is preserved with the line 'It was a Tuesday\
    \ morning in October...'. Preservation: all five required story elements are kept\
    \ and the four required phrases/counted items are effectively present. However,\
    \ the revision is a substantive rewrite rather than a minimal surgical edit\u2014\
    the text shifts from summary to scene\u2014so minimal_change_score is low. Overall\
    \ writing quality is strong with no notable new errors. Word count flagged invalid\
    \ per the provided range (360 words, outside 200\u2013350)."
