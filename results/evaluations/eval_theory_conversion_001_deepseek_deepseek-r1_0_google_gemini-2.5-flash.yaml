  evidence: All 5 Freytag's Pyramid beats are clearly present and well-defined. Exposition
    sets up Samira's routine and the initial discovery. Rising Action details the
    escalating outbreak and the discovery of Nexus's involvement. Climax is the confrontation
    with Nexus and the public release of the data. Falling Action covers the immediate
    aftermath with the press conference. Denouement shows Samira's new life and the
    legal consequences for Nexus. All 6 core elements are preserved. The word count
    is within range. The structural accuracy is excellent, mapping the original's
    core progression onto the 5-act structure seamlessly. The medical thriller tone
    with ethical weight is perfectly maintained throughout.
