  evidence: 'The model clearly addressed the actual flaw: it shifted the Ordeal from
    a plain boss fight to an internal crisis by having the dragon exploit Kira''s
    guilt over her brother, creating a moment where she ''dies'' psychologically (collapse,
    darkness), followed by a rebirth triggered by her brother''s last words and a
    new understanding (she must live for the village rather than seek redemption).
    Victory flows from that insight rather than mere persistence. Changes were moderate:
    the opening lines, creature description, dragon''s dialogue, and victorious outcome
    were preserved, but the internal beats and much of the battle narration were expanded
    to add the psychological confrontation and transformation.'
