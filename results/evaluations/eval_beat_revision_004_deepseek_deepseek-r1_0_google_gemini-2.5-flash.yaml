  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' and revised it to demonstrate Rachel's traits and relationships
    through action and dialogue. It fully fixed the info-dump style and introduced
    sensory details. The changes were extensive, essentially a rewrite of the segment,
    hence the low minimal_change_score, but this was necessary to address the core
    flaw effectively.
