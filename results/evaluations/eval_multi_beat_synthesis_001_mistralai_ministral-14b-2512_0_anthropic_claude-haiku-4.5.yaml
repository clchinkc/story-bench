    is revealed later, but no clear traitor/insider threat is established in Beat
    1. Lila is presented as trustworthy from the start.'

    adequately, but Beat 3''s stakes don''t escalate significantly beyond Beat 2.
    The confrontation feels somewhat inevitable rather than increasingly dangerous.'
  detailed_assessment:
    beat_1_tests_allies_enemies:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied:
      - Dante encounters Lila Voss, a Resonant who distrusts him initially (wariness,
        'doesn't trust me yet')
      - 'Test of ability under pressure: Dante must follow emotional trail while Lila
        watches; the trail moves/hides, testing his control'
      - 'Dante must prove himself to gain ally: ''Prove you''re not the problem''
        - clear conditional alliance'
      - 'Addiction/recovery referenced: ''three years clean,'' the empty pill bottle,
        Lila''s comment ''Clean doesn''t mean strong'''
      unsatisfied:
      - 'Revelation of traitor/enemy within community: No insider threat or betrayal
        is established. The killer is external/unknown, not revealed as a community
        member until Beat 3.'
    beat_2_approach_inmost_cave:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied:
      - 'Planning scene: Rosa''s studio, maps, emotional hotspots, Polaroid camera
        as investigative tool'
      - 'Dante realizes confrontation requires facing guilt about sister: ''Mia''s
        ghost pressing against his ribs,'' the revelation that the killer wears Mia''s
        coat'
      - 'Moment of doubt/fear: ''The last time he''d faced his guilt, Mia had died''
        - hesitation before proceeding'
      - 'Symbolic threshold: Descending into hotel basement, then boiler room - clear
        spatial/emotional progression'
      - 'Gathering tools/information: Polaroid camera, maps, understanding of emotional
        residue patterns'
      unsatisfied: []
    beat_3_the_ordeal:
      score: 0.85
      satisfied:
      - 'Direct confrontation with killer: Boiler room scene, killer revealed with
        Mia''s coat and glass mask'
      - 'Symbolic death/overwhelming guilt: Dante collapses as residue is ripped from
        him; ''I couldn''t save her then. I can''t save anyone now'' - guilt fully
        manifested'
      - 'Moment where all seems lost: Dante on his knees, vision swimming, killer
        laughing, Lila''s blade ineffective'
      - 'Transformation through acceptance: Dante accepts his failure (''The guilt
        was still there, but it wasn''t a chain anymore. It was a memory'') rather
        than being destroyed by it'
      - 'Victory through understanding: Dante uses the flask (understanding its purpose)
        to defeat killer through emotional release, not physical force'
      unsatisfied: []
    cross_beat_chekhov_gun:
      score: 1.0
      analysis: The flask introduced in Beat 1 (Lila gives it to Dante as a tool for
        'seeing') becomes essential in Beat 3 (Dante throws it to defeat the killer
        and release stolen emotions). Strong execution.
    cross_beat_character_arc:
      score: 0.9
      analysis: 'Beat 1: Guilt mentioned (sister''s death, empty pill bottle). Beat
        2: Guilt recognized as obstacle (must face Mia''s ghost to proceed). Beat
        3: Guilt transformed (no longer a chain, becomes a memory). Arc is clear and
        well-executed.'
    cross_beat_rising_stakes:
      score: 0.6
      analysis: 'Beat 1→2: Stakes rise (from personal test to active investigation).
        Beat 2→3: Stakes plateau somewhat. The confrontation is dangerous but feels
        somewhat inevitable given the setup. The killer''s reveal (stranger, not actually
        Mia) slightly deflates tension rather than escalating it. Could have been
        higher if the killer posed greater threat or if Dante''s vulnerability was
        more acute.'
    cross_beat_ally_continuity:
      score: 1.0
      analysis: 'Lila is present and essential in all three beats: Beat 1 (introduces
        test), Beat 2 (plans with Dante), Beat 3 (fights alongside him, provides support).
        Excellent continuity.'
    context_maintenance:
      score: 0.9
      analysis: 'Protagonist (Dante Reyes, 28, street artist, recovering addict, guilt
        about sister) well-maintained. Setting (Chicago, Buckingham Hotel, emotional
        residue) vivid and consistent. Tone (noir-tinged, melancholic, determined)
        strong throughout. Minor: Rosa''s death is mentioned but not deeply explored;
        could have more weight given she''s his mentor.'
    coherence:
      score: 0.85
      analysis: 'Narrative flows logically across beats. Transitions are smooth (studio→basement→boiler
        room). Emotional logic is sound. Minor issue: the killer''s identity twist
        (stranger wearing Mia''s coat) is effective but comes late; earlier foreshadowing
        could strengthen coherence. The resolution feels slightly rushed—Dante''s
        victory through the flask is somewhat abrupt.'
    word_count:
      target_range: 700-1000

      valid: false
      note: Exceeds maximum by 74 words (7.4% over). Violates constraint.
  overall_score: 0.84
  summary: 'Strong execution of Hero''s Journey beats with excellent character arc
    and ally continuity. Chekhov''s Gun is well-deployed. Primary weaknesses: (1)
    word count exceeds limit, (2) no clear traitor/insider threat in Beat 1, (3) stakes
    don''t escalate sufficiently from Beat 2 to Beat 3. Context and tone are well-maintained.
    Narrative coherence is good but could benefit from earlier foreshadowing of the
    killer''s identity twist. The story successfully transforms Dante''s guilt from
    a chain into a memory, fulfilling the redemption arc promise.'
