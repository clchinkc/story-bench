  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: the original segment lacked
    true devastation and maintained multiple viable options and support systems. The
    revision systematically eliminates all escape routes: (1) Denise''s betrayal removes
    his closest ally and reveals the fundraiser is now impossible without her leadership;
    (2) his wife''s abandonment strips away personal support; (3) the grant is implicitly
    rejected (''wouldn''t come through in time''); (4) Marcus is isolated and hopeless.
    The ''whiff of death'' is powerfully executed through the metaphorical death of
    his identity (15 years of community building, the ''family'' he created) and the
    literal loss of relationships. All four required phrases are preserved verbatim
    or near-verbatim: ''Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands'' (exact),
    ''Thirty days to vacate the community center'' (exact), ''"There has to be something
    we can do," said Denise'' (exact), ''He rubbed his temples'' (exact). The revision
    maintains the setting, Denise''s presence (though transformed), and the eviction
    premise. Changes were surgical: the model inserted the betrayal revelation, the
    wife''s text, and Marcus''s emotional breakdown—approximately 100 words added/modified
    out of 256, making this ~60% original text preserved. The writing quality is strong
    with no new errors; the emotional arc is devastating and appropriate to the beat.
    Minor deduction from minimal_change_score reflects the substantial insertion of
    new plot points, though these were necessary and well-integrated.'
