  evidence: 'The model addressed the correct problem: the All Is Lost beat being insufficiently
    devastating. It introduces the fundraiser collapse, the grant rejection, Denise''s
    betrayal (joining the developer), and Marcus''s wife removing the children—creating
    isolation and a ''whiff of death'' (the center as a corpse, lights snapping off).
    These changes exhaust his options and support and push him to genuine hopelessness,
    so the diagnosis and fix are correct and complete. Preservation requirements were
    met exactly—the four required phrases and all four elements (Marcus, community
    center/youth program, eviction catalyst, Denise) remain. Changes are substantive
    but not a full rewrite: core lines are preserved and new scenes were added to
    deepen the beat, so I rated minimal_change as moderate (0.6). Writing quality
    is strong with evocative imagery and no major errors.'
