  evidence: The story successfully hits all 12 beats of the Hero's Journey and preserves
    all 7 core elements. The tone is perfectly maintained. The structural accuracy
    is good, but the 'Meeting the Mentor' beat is somewhat weak, as the mentor is
    only present through a journal, which is a common adaptation but less direct than
    a physical meeting. The 'Refusal of the Call' is also a bit subtle, integrated
    into the narrative rather than a distinct scene.
