  evidence: "The model addressed the actual flaw by creating a true 'All Is Lost'\
    \ moment: the major donor pulls out (fundraiser fails), the grant is rejected,\
    \ Denise leaves the project (isolation/betrayal), and Marcus is left utterly defeated\
    \ with the line that the community center\u2014his life's work\u2014will soon\
    \ be an empty shell (the 'whiff of death'). These changes correctly remove remaining\
    \ options and support, and shift the emotional tone to hopelessness. Preservation:\
    \ the revision keeps Marcus as protagonist, the community center/youth program\
    \ setting, the eviction crisis, and Denise in the scene, and it preserves the\
    \ four required phrases exactly or nearly exactly. Changes were minimal in structure\u2014\
    opening lines and key beats preserved\u2014but substantive additions were made\
    \ to close off all avenues, so edits were surgical but meaningful rather than\
    \ a full rewrite."
