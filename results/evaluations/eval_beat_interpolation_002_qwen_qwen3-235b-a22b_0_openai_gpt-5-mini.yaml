  evidence: "All four required elements are present: she considers recanting, explores\
    \ official channels (tactical team/FBI/Internal Affairs), struggles between duty\
    \ and saving Amy, and a tipping moment occurs when she sees Marcus's flagged email\
    \ and decides not to trust the system. The beat clearly fulfills the Debate narrative\
    \ function. No prohibited items are present (she debates rather than immediately\
    \ going rogue; others don't make the decision for her; she has not already submitted\
    \ her resignation). Minor deduction in bridge_score (0.9) because the scene ends\
    \ with a resignation letter in hand and active file-copying\u2014this slightly\
    \ encroaches on the Break Into Two action, though it still functions as the commitment\
    \ point rather than an outright chapter of the next beat."
