    crew members—there is tension but no explicit friction or trust breakdown.'

    requirement that a crew member be compromised/dangered is unmet.'
  - 'Cross-beat (Chekhov''s Gun): A specific detail established in Fun and Games (e.g.,
    a security measure, exit route, or crew skill) is not paid off as a critical element
    during Bad Guys Close In—the setup-to-payoff linkage is weak.'
