  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified the core flaw\u2014the original\
    \ was pure exposition through telling (info-dump style) rather than showing character\
    \ through action and scene. The revision transforms this into a lived scene with\
    \ sensory grounding and behavioral revelation. FLAW CORRECTION: Fully addressed.\
    \ The revision shows Rachel's detective instincts through her cold case work and\
    \ pattern recognition ('Nobody followed up,' 'Wrong brother confessed'). Her relationship\
    \ with James is revealed through natural dialogue and his knowing behavior (bringing\
    \ black coffee, understanding her obsession). Her devotion to work is demonstrated\
    \ through action (spreading files, Tuesday morning preference) rather than stated.\
    \ Setting is grounded in sensory detail ('October morning light filtered through\
    \ the precinct windows, illuminating the dust motes'). The cat appears naturally\
    \ in conversation. BEAT SATISFACTION: Exposition executed excellently\u2014establishes\
    \ baseline, shows ordinary world before disruption, creates investment through\
    \ character behavior and partnership dynamic. The final two sentences ('She didn't\
    \ know this particular Tuesday would be different...') effectively signal the\
    \ approaching inciting incident. PRESERVATION: All 5 required elements present:\
    \ Detective Rachel Torres (name/role intact), Detective James Oyelaran (name/role\
    \ intact), cat named Sherlock (referenced naturally), Queens apartment (mentioned),\
    \ October Tuesday timing (explicitly stated). All 4 required phrases present:\
    \ 'Detective Rachel Torres' (opening), 'Detective James Oyelaran' (dialogue),\
    \ 'cat named Sherlock' (exact phrase), 'Tuesday morning' + October context (present).\
    \ MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is a SUBSTANTIAL REWRITE, not minimal surgical\
    \ edits. The original 298-word info-dump was completely restructured into a scene-based\
    \ narrative. However, this level of revision was necessary to fix the fundamental\
    \ flaw (telling vs. showing). The constraint to preserve 5 elements and 4 phrases\
    \ was met, but the execution required wholesale reconstruction rather than targeted\
    \ edits. QUALITY: Writing is professional, dialogue feels natural, sensory details\
    \ are well-integrated, no new errors introduced. Pacing is strong with effective\
    \ foreshadowing."
