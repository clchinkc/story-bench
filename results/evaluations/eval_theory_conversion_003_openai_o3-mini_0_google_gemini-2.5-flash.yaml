  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the Three-Act
    Structure. Act 1 (Setup) covers Kenji's ordinary world, the inciting incident
    (Yuki's letter), and the first plot point (deciding to go to Kyoto and meeting
    Haruki). Act 2A (Rising Action, First Half) includes obstacles in reconnecting
    with Yuki and the midpoint (village festival, false victory). Act 2B (Rising Action,
    Second Half) introduces complications (business rivals, Yuki's betrayal) and the
    second plot point (rejecting the deal). Act 3 (Resolution) covers the climax (confrontation
    with Yuki, apology) and denouement (bamboo craft shop). All 8 core elements are
    preserved, and the tone is consistently maintained. The structural accuracy is
    good, but the 'Second Plot Point' feels a little less defined as a distinct 'point'
    compared to the 'First Plot Point' and 'Midpoint', blending slightly into the
    'Complications' leading to the climax. However, it's still clearly present as
    the turning point before the final act.
