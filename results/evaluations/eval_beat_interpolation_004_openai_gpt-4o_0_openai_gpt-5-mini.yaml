  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Thomas conducts a direct examination;
    there is a clear moment where Dr. Okonkwo appears likely to recant; Thomas takes
    decisive, influential action (appealing to her daughter and leaning in) that changes
    the moment; and Dr. Okonkwo ultimately confesses, producing the turning point.
    None of the forbidden items appear (no passive Thomas, no deus ex machina, no
    straightforward untroubled confession, no defense victory). Character behavior
    and setting remain consistent and the scene transitions cleanly toward the falling
    action.'
