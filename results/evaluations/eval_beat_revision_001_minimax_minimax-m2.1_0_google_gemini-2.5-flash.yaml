  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The
    Ordeal as a mere boss battle and not a transformative crisis. It addressed all
    four points of the actual flaw: (1) The dragon exploits Kira''s guilt over her
    brother''s death, (2) Kira has a symbolic ''death'' moment where she gives up
    due to guilt, (3) She experiences a rebirth/transformation by understanding her
    brother''s life rather than his death, and (4) Her victory comes from this new
    understanding and acceptance, not just persistence. The changes were significant
    enough to fix the flaw but still retained much of the original structure and dialogue,
    making them moderately minimal. One required phrase was slightly altered (''earth-shaking
    roar'' vs ''a earth-shaking roar'').'
