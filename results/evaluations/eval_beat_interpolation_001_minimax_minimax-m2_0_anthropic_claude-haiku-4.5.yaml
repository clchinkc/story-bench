  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Marcus\
    \ introduced as wise mentor figure with mysterious shop and credible authority;\
    \ (2) Practical wisdom delivered ('The Thornwood tests intentions, not sword arms')\
    \ and tangible tools provided (compass, satchel); (3) Elena's doubt shifts convincingly\
    \ from refusal ('I don't trek through enchanted forests') to reluctant acceptance\
    \ ('It would have to be enough'); (4) Librarian skills reframed as assets ('You\
    \ notice things others miss\u2014marks, patterns'). The beat executes the mentor\
    \ function perfectly\u2014Marcus provides guidance and gifts without solving problems\
    \ or accompanying Elena. All must-not violations avoided: Elena remains doubtful\
    \ and reluctant (not confident/eager), Marcus explicitly refuses to accompany\
    \ her, setting remains in the shop/street (not forest), no magical powers discovered.\
    \ Character voice consistent throughout\u2014Elena's self-deprecating, analytical\
    \ tone maintained; Marcus's cryptic wisdom appropriate to mentor archetype. Bridge\
    \ between beats seamless: BEFORE ends with Elena refusing the call; GENERATED\
    \ shows her encountering mentor and reluctantly accepting; AFTER shows her at\
    \ forest threshold ready to cross. Continuity perfect\u2014compass and satchel\
    \ from Generated appear in After; Elena's emotional state progresses logically.\
    \ DEDUCTION: Word count (566) significantly exceeds 350-word maximum by 216 words\
    \ (61% over limit). This is a substantial structural violation despite excellent\
    \ narrative quality."
