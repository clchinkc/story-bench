  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The 'must not' items
    were successfully avoided. The character's internal conflict and external interactions
    perfectly capture the essence of the Debate beat, leading to the 'third option'
    that sets up the Break into Two. The bridge to the next beat is seamless, showing
    Sarah's decision to resign and go rogue.
