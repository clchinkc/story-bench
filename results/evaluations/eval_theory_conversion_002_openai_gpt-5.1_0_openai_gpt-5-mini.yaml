  evidence: "All 12 Campbell beats are present and clearly mapped: Ordinary World\
    \ (workshop life), Call to Adventure (spring dries), Refusal (Maya hesitates),\
    \ Meeting the Mentor (grandmother's journal/ancestral guidance), Crossing the\
    \ Threshold (journey to shrine), Tests/Allies/Enemies (climb, scarce water, ravens,\
    \ struggle with clay), Approach to the Inmost Cave (ruined shrine, preparing kiln),\
    \ Ordeal (surrendering control to shape the vessel), Reward (completed vessel),\
    \ The Road Back (descent carrying the vessel, temptation to abandon), Resurrection\
    \ (setting the vessel and water returning; Maya reborn), Return with Elixir (water\
    \ restored; her changed role). All 7 required elements are preserved (Maya protagonist;\
    \ pottery central; grandmother's legacy; mountain shrine journey; dried spring\
    \ problem; theme of surrender; Maya's transformation). Deduction from perfect\
    \ structural accuracy (scored 0.9) because the 'Meeting the Mentor' functions\
    \ as a journal/ancestral voice rather than a distinct living mentor and 'Tests/Allies/Enemies'\
    \ lacks clearly delineated allies or antagonists\u2014these are present but not\
    \ strongly personified. Word count is invalid (provided text = 2174 words, outside\
    \ requested 600\u2013800), so word_count_valid is false. Tone remains quiet, meditative,\
    \ and transformative throughout."
