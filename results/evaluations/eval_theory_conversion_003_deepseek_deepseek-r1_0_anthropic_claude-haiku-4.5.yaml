  evidence: 'All 4 three-act beats present: Act 1 Setup (office loss + letter arrival
    establishing ordinary world and inciting incident through paragraph 1-2); Act
    2A (Kyoto arrival, Haruki mentorship, village integration, midpoint realization
    of Yuki''s completeness); Act 2B (business offer temptation, Yuki''s rejection,
    dark moment of isolation and self-reckoning); Act 3 (climactic choice to refuse
    investors, modest reconciliation at wedding venue, denouement in bamboo shop).
    All 8 elements preserved: Kenji protagonist, corporate career loss, estranged
    Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki craftsman, business temptation, theme of people over
    ambition, bamboo shop ending. Structure follows Aristotelian three-act with clear
    setup-confrontation-resolution arc. Tone masterfully maintained throughout: quiet,
    contemplative, Japanese aesthetic (bamboo, maple, rice paper screens, crickets
    vs. sirens), redemptive without sentimentality. Minor deduction (0.05) for structural_accuracy:
    First Plot Point could be more explicitly marked as distinct from inciting incident
    (letter arrival serves both functions, slightly blurring the beat). Minor tone
    deduction (0.05): one phrase ''hummed in his veins'' slightly more dramatic than
    the restrained aesthetic elsewhere.'
error: null
