  evidence: 'BEATS PRESENT: Act 1 Setup (Ordinary World + Inciting Incident) is clearly
    established through Kenji''s job loss and letter arrival. First Plot Point is
    implied but underdeveloped. Act 2A/2B and Act 3 are completely absent—the conversion
    cuts off mid-sentence. PRESERVED ELEMENTS: Kenji (✓), lost corporate career (✓),
    estranged daughter Yuki (✓), wedding in Kyoto (✓), business deal temptation (✓),
    theme of choosing people over ambition (✓). MISSING: Haruki the bamboo craftsman
    (0), ending with bamboo craft shop (0). STRUCTURAL ISSUES: Only ~40% of required
    three-act structure present; conversion is incomplete and truncated. TONE STRENGTHS:
    Excellent quiet drama, strong Japanese aesthetic (rain-streaked glass, Shinkansen,
    careful hand, bamboo references), contemplative pacing, sensory details. CRITICAL
    FLAW: Word count is 219/750 (71% under target) and text ends mid-sentence (''He''),
    indicating incomplete conversion. Conversion requires full three-act arc with
    all 8 elements and 550-750 words to meet requirements.'
