  evidence: The output perfectly captures the Debate beat. Sarah considers recanting,
    then going through official channels, and the internal conflict is palpable. The
    conversation with Webb serves as the tipping point, leading her to the 'third
    option' of going rogue. All 'must not' items are avoided, and the character and
    continuity are strong, setting up the next beat effectively.
