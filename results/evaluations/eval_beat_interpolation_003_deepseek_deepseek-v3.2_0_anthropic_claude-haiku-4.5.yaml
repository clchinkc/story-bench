  evidence: 'All 4 required elements present and excellently executed: (1) Multiple
    station areas explored (quarters, medical bay, corridor, hydroponics bay, approaching
    Lab Seven); (2) Clues discovered progressively (chess game, coffee, bio-signs,
    corrupted logs, ''boundary is thinner'' phrase, energy spike); (3) Transformed
    crew encountered mysteriously (translucent figure, shimmer effects, flickering
    forms, voices—deliberately ambiguous); (4) Significant obstacle overcome (hydroponics
    bay with high CO2, cognitive impairment risk, physical challenge). All must-not
    items avoided: data core not found yet (only located at end), crew doesn''t explain
    everything (only cryptic hints), mission continues, Yuki doesn''t know about dimensional
    transformation beforehand. Character voice remains consistent—scientific, observant,
    adaptive. Bridge is seamless: BEFORE ends with arrival and mystery; GENERATED
    shows active search and discovery; AFTER begins with core location and revelation.
    Setting continuity perfect: same station, logical progression through areas, environmental
    details consistent. The Search beat is authentically executed with struggle, adaptation,
    and incremental progress rather than immediate answers.'
