  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are clearly present: Exposition (Samira''s established
    career and world), Rising Action (quarantine, escalating cases, investigation,
    Nexus reveal), Climax (Nexus confrontation and her refusal to capitulate), Falling
    Action (chaotic press conference and release of cure), Denouement (outbreak contained,
    Nexus investigated, Samira unemployable but at peace). All six required elements
    appear explicitly: Samira, engineered virus discovery, Raj, Nexus Biotech antagonist,
    public release of the cure, and Samira''s career sacrifice. The piece maintains
    a medical-thriller tension and ethical weight throughout and maps cleanly onto
    Freytag''s five stages, so scores are full marks.'
