  analysis:
    beats_analysis: 'All three required beats are present and well-executed. Search:
      Jin spends weeks sifting through Collective archives, driven by desperate hope.
      Find: He discovers the modified carbon capture technology and realizes the conspiracy
      extends beyond Earth. Take: He accepts the consortium''s platform but compromises
      his integrity by agreeing to frame the truth as propaganda.'
    must_include_analysis: 'All 6 elements successfully integrated: (1) Jin navigates
      Collective culture/politics through disorientation, menial tasks, and learning
      the credit/favor system; (2) Lyra serves as mentor, teaching him marketplace
      dynamics and guiding him through factional politics; (3) Unexpected discovery:
      the tech was modified, not suppressed, and the Collective unknowingly adopted
      a compromised version; (4) Jin finds his platform and voice through the consortium;
      (5) He takes action by accepting their offer; (6) Clear moral compromise: he
      must weaponize truth and omit nuance for political gain.'
    must_not_analysis: "All forbidden elements successfully avoided: (1) No easy integration\u2014\
      Jin struggles with dismissal, scorn, and irrelevance; (2) No contact with Earth\
      \ family (Yuna and parents are only mentioned in reflection, not contacted);\
      \ (3) No violence or weapons present; (4) Conspiracy plot remains unresolved\u2014\
      the full truth hasn't been released, and larger implications remain open."
    tone_analysis: Contemplative and politically charged tone maintained throughout.
      Personal stakes are evident in Jin's internal conflict. The prose balances philosophical
      reflection ('simple good-versus-evil narrative') with immediate tension. Minor
      deduction only for occasional moments where political complexity could be slightly
      deeper, but overall execution is strong.
    ending_analysis: "Perfectly ends at 'Take' beat. Jin has gained a platform and\
      \ renewed purpose but paid the price of compromising his integrity. The final\
      \ image\u2014looking at Earth while accepting the consortium's terms\u2014crystallizes\
      \ the moral cost. The ending leaves him transformed but morally diminished,\
      \ exactly as required."
