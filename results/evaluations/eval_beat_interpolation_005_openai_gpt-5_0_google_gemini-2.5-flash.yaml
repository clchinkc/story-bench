  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. Maya discovers Alejandro's
    vulnerability regarding his taste post-surgery. Their relationship shifts from
    purely professional as they share a meal and a moment of connection. Maya's commitment
    deepens beyond the contract, as evidenced by her 'I'm not here to perform. I'm
    here to feed you' and her internal thoughts about six months feeling like a beginning.
    All 'must not' items were successfully avoided. Character voices are consistent,
    and the scene bridges the previous and subsequent beats effectively while maintaining
    setting continuity.
