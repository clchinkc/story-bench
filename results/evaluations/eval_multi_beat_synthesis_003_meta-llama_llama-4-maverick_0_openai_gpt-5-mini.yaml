  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1: Lack of clear moments of humor/dry wit—tone is stylish but not playful/confidently
    humorous as required.'
  - 'Beat 2: No false victory or clear midpoint ''win'' is shown; the narrative skips
    a distinct false victory beat.'
  - 'Beat 3: Security does not actually close in on the crew—no escalating security
    pressure described.'
  - 'Beat 3: No team friction or trust issues surface; crew remains cohesive without
    conflict.'
  - 'Beat 3: No crew member is shown compromised or in explicit danger.'
  - 'Beat 3: Miri is not forced to choose between the painting and saving/revenge
    for someone—no decisive dilemma.'
  - 'Beat 3: The walls do not literally/figuratively close in—the sense of entrapment/genuine
    danger is underdeveloped.'
  - 'Cross-beat (Chekhov''s Gun): A setup (e.g., Lena hacking or a planned exit route)
    established in Fun & Games is not paid off or used critically in Bad Guys Close
    In.'
  - 'Cross-beat (Tonal Escalation): Tone does not clearly shift across the three beats
    from playful confidence to shaken stakes to gallows humor; Beat 3 lacks the required
    tonal gallows-humor escalation.'
  - 'Cross-beat (Mentor Presence): Mentor is revealed late but is not shown as background
    in Beat 1 and does not exhibit a clear, increasing presence across all three beats.'
  - 'Cross-beat (Team Dynamics): No crew member has a clear, consistent arc that affects
    the plot across all three beats.'
  - 'Context omission: Miri''s full backstory (wrongful accusation, blacklisting,
    moral rationale for stealing) is not referenced—context is present but incomplete.'
  - 'Word count: Generated output is ~444 words, outside requested 700-1000 range.'
