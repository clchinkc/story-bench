  failed_items:
  - Team friction exists (Jules' plea to ditch the painting) but is relatively underdeveloped—conflict
    surfaces briefly rather than being explored in depth.
  - Mentor Eleonora's connection to Miri is revealed at the midpoint with strong impact,
    but there is minimal foreshadowing of her presence in Beat 1 (she is effectively
    absent until the reveal).
  - Miri's internal calculus between saving people and completing the mission is clear
    in action but could use a touch more internal deliberation to heighten emotional
    stakes.
