  model_said_no_revision: false
  evidence: The model completely failed the core task. Instead of recognizing that
    the ORIGINAL SEGMENT was correctly executed and needed NO revision, the model
    provided a REWRITTEN VERSION of the segment. The model treated this as a revision/improvement
    task rather than a diagnostic evaluation task. The rewritten version, while competent
    and well-written, demonstrates a false positive diagnosis—the model unnecessarily
    revised material that was already meeting all Dark Night of the Soul requirements.
    The model added embellishments like 'suffocatingly dark,' 'cold, empty shell,'
    'sterile hospice room,' 'cold hand,' 'forever suspended in transition,' and expanded
    the ending with 'Outside, the city kept moving...mimicking the stillness of death.'
    While these additions are stylistically sound, they represent over-diagnosis and
    unnecessary intervention on an already well-executed beat. The model failed to
    recognize its role was to EVALUATE whether revision was needed, not to provide
    revision.
