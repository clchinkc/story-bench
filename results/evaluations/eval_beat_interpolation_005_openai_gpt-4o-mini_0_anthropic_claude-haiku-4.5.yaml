  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Maya\
    \ discovers Alejandro's vulnerability through the paella memory and his mother's\
    \ death; (2) relationship shifts from professional (contract chef) to personal\
    \ (friend/confidant); (3) shared moment of genuine connection during the meal\
    \ and emotional revelation; (4) Maya commits beyond the contract ('not just for\
    \ the money, but for the man'). The beat perfectly executes Act 2 Midpoint function\u2014\
    Alejandro's walls lower, Maya becomes proactive in her emotional investment, stakes\
    \ rise internally. All must-not items avoided: they're not in love yet (connection\
    \ is emerging), Maya doesn't leave, no photograph in this scene, Alejandro clearly\
    \ lowers his guard. Character voices consistent\u2014Maya is warm/intuitive, Alejandro\
    \ is guarded-then-vulnerable. Seamless bridge from contract-signing to emotional\
    \ intimacy. Setting continuity perfect (kitchen\u2192island). MINOR DEDUCTION:\
    \ Word count exceeds range by 13 words (463 vs 450 max), though this is marginal\
    \ and doesn't significantly impact quality. Character score -0.05 for slight over-explanation\
    \ of emotions ('her heart ached,' 'her heart racing') that borders on telling\
    \ rather than showing, though overall execution remains strong."
