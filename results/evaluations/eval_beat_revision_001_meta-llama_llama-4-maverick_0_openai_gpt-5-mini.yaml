  evidence: 'The model clearly targeted the actual flaw: it made the dragon exploit
    Kira''s guilt over her brother, inserted a moment where she collapses and her
    world goes dark (a symbolic ''death''), and showed a rebirth where she recalls
    her brother''s final moments and fights with renewed ferocity—so victory stems
    from regained resolve/insight rather than mere persistence. All four required
    elements/phrases were preserved verbatim or nearly so. Changes were mostly surgical
    (added internal reflection and the symbolic death/rebirth) rather than a full
    rewrite. Weaknesses: the ''death'' and transformation are somewhat cursory and
    rapid—more emotional depth or a clearer psychological shift would make the Ordeal
    more fully realized. Minor grammatical awkwardness ("a earth-shaking roar") was
    retained from the original.'
