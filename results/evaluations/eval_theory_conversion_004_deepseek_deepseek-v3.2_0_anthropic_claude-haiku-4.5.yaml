  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated: (1) You—opening
    establishes Zoe''s library sanctuary and emotional isolation; (2) Need—explicitly
    stated ''to connect'' and the loneliness humming beneath safety; (3) Go—Ms. Okafor''s
    push and Zoe crossing into unfamiliar territory; (4) Search—the iterative interview
    process, fumbling, persistence, learning that listening is excavation; (5) Find—Bernard''s
    breakthrough moment (''You''re the first person who ever asked the right questions'')
    and Zoe''s realization about courage; (6) Take—town hall presentation where she
    publicly shares Bernard''s story despite anxiety; (7) Return—autumn, Bernard''s
    death, library feels different, funeral speaking; (8) Change—journalism applications,
    essay about forgotten voices, demonstrated capability. All 8 core elements preserved:
    Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history program, Ms. Okafor (initiating
    figure), Bernard Park (key relationship), social anxiety (woven throughout), town
    hall presentation (climactic moment), Bernard''s death and journalism ending (resolution).
    Tone is consistently gentle, intimate, and emotionally true—intimate second-person-adjacent
    narration (''The quiet was a blanket,'' ''his truth''), metaphorical language
    (''excavation,'' ''repository''), and earned emotional beats. Minor deduction
    (0.05) for structural_accuracy: the ''Take'' beat could be slightly more explicit
    about the ''price'' Zoe pays beyond anxiety—though the vulnerability is clear.
    Tone deduction (0.05) minimal—maintains warmth throughout, though final paragraph
    slightly shifts toward inspirational rather than purely intimate.'
