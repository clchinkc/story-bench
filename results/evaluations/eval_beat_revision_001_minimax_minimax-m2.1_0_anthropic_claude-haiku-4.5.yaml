  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: The original segment treated
    The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative psychological crisis.
    The revision perfectly addresses all four required fixes: (1) The dragon exploits
    Kira''s deepest fear by weaponizing her guilt over her brother''s death, (2) A
    clear ''death'' moment occurs when Kira collapses psychologically, accepting her
    guilt and hopelessness, (3) Transformation is explicit—she shifts from guilt-driven
    to purpose-driven, from self-blame to self-forgiveness, (4) Victory comes from
    new understanding (accepting she couldn''t control her brother''s death) rather
    than mere persistence. All 4 required phrases are preserved: ''Kira faced the
    Shadow Dragon across the chasm,'' ''The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian
    scales and burning eyes,'' ''"You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled,''
    and ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar.'' The changes are
    surgical rather than wholesale—the model inserted psychological depth and internal
    conflict into the existing battle structure without removing or fundamentally
    restructuring the original framework. The revision maintains the external action
    while layering in the internal transformation. Minor deduction from minimal_change_score
    (0.7 vs 1.0) because approximately 40% of the text is new material (the guilt
    dialogue, the internal reflection, the rebirth moment), though this is justified
    by the flaw requiring substantial psychological content. Writing quality is professional
    with no new errors; the prose is emotionally resonant and thematically coherent.'
