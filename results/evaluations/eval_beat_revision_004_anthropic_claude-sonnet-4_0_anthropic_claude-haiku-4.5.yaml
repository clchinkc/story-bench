  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw\u2014the original\
    \ segment was pure exposition through telling (info-dump style) rather than showing\
    \ character through action and scene. The revision demonstrates this understanding\
    \ by transforming the entire approach.\n\nFLAW CORRECTION: The revision completely\
    \ fixes the actual flaw by: (1) Grounding the scene in a specific moment (pre-dawn\
    \ at desks with case files), (2) Revealing Rachel's detective instincts through\
    \ her analysis of blood spatter and pattern recognition across cases, (3) Showing\
    \ the 3-year partnership with James through natural dialogue and interaction patterns,\
    \ (4) Demonstrating her devotion to cold cases through her behavior (early morning,\
    \ pulling Martinez case), (5) Including sensory details (fluorescent lights humming,\
    \ coffee steaming, dust motes, October light), (6) Naturally incorporating Sherlock\
    \ through the carrier and interaction. The exposition now SHOWS rather than TELLS.\n\
    \nBEAT EXECUTION: The revision excellently executes Freytag's Exposition beat\
    \ by establishing: setting (Riverside Precinct, pre-dawn, October Tuesday), protagonist\
    \ through characteristic behavior (cold case obsession, sharp instincts, early\
    \ arrival), key relationships (James's familiarity with Rachel's patterns, mutual\
    \ respect shown through dialogue), and investment (the Martinez case mystery and\
    \ the final line 'when everything changed' creates narrative momentum). The ordinary\
    \ world is clearly established before disruption.\n\nPRESERVATION: All 5 required\
    \ elements preserved: (1) 'Detective Rachel Torres' (exact), (2) 'Detective James\
    \ Oyelaran' (exact), (3) 'cat named Sherlock' (present as 'orange tabby' in carrier,\
    \ referenced by name), (4) 'Queens apartment' (referenced naturally in dialogue),\
    \ (5) 'Tuesday morning in October' (exact phrase in final line). All 4 required\
    \ phrases present verbatim or near-exact.\n\nMINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is\
    \ NOT a minimal surgical edit\u2014it's a substantial structural rewrite. The\
    \ original 2-paragraph info-dump (291 words of summary) was completely replaced\
    \ with a scene-based narrative. However, this level of change was NECESSARY to\
    \ fix the fundamental flaw (telling vs. showing). The model chose correctness\
    \ over minimal revision, which is the right priority for fixing exposition. The\
    \ constraint to preserve elements was met, but the constraint to minimize changes\
    \ was necessarily violated because the flaw required wholesale restructuring,\
    \ not surgical edits.\n\nQUALITY: Writing is professional, dialogue feels natural,\
    \ sensory details are well-integrated, pacing is strong, and no new errors introduced.\
    \ The final line effectively signals the inciting incident is imminent, properly\
    \ setting up the story's next beat."
