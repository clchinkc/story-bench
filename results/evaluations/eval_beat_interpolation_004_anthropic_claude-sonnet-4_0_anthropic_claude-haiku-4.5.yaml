  evidence: "All four required elements present and executed excellently: (1) Direct\
    \ examination occurs with Thomas asking about her position and Cardiozine data;\
    \ (2) Clear near-recant moment where she hesitates, gives evasive answers ('within\
    \ acceptable parameters'), and the case appears to slip away; (3) Thomas takes\
    \ decisive action by revealing knowledge of Maya's condition and offering Johns\
    \ Hopkins trial access, directly influencing her decision; (4) Turning point clearly\
    \ marked when she closes/opens her eyes and becomes 'the scientist again,' then\
    \ delivers full testimony with specific details. All must-not items avoided: she\
    \ struggles internally before testifying, Thomas actively influences outcome rather\
    \ than remaining passive, defense loses (objections come too late), no external\
    \ deus ex machina (Thomas's offer is his own action, not new evidence). Character\
    \ voice remains consistent\u2014Thomas shows both prosecutorial skill and moral\
    \ complexity. Bridge between beats seamless: climax ends with truth revealed and\
    \ defense objecting; falling action begins with verdict and explores consequences.\
    \ Setting continuity perfect: courtroom \u2192 hallway \u2192 verdict timeline\
    \ flows logically. The narrative executes the climax beat's core function: highest\
    \ tension, protagonist's decisive choice, irrevocable turning point determining\
    \ outcome."
