  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Alejandro reveals vulnerability
    (grandmother/melancholy), the relationship shifts from professional to personal,
    a shared meal creates genuine connection, and Maya explicitly commits to staying
    for more than money. None of the forbidden items appear (no pre-existing love
    declaration or overtly sexual intimacy, no decision to leave or contract breach,
    no photograph in this scene, and Alejandro does lower his guard). Character behavior
    and setting remain consistent with the before/after beats, and the scene effectively
    functions as the Midpoint commitment.'
