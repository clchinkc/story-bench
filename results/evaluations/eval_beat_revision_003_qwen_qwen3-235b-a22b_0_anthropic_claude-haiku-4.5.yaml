  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified the actual flaw—Sophie showed no
    transformation and immediately reverted to workaholic patterns, making the journey
    meaningless. The revision directly addresses this by demonstrating behavioral
    change through: (1) Sophie consciously choosing NOT to check work emails immediately
    (''fingers hovering over her phone''s screen before sliding it into her coat pocket''),
    (2) A specific insight from the retreat (''made me realize how loud my head used
    to be''), (3) Physical markers of change (phone placed face-down on dash, measured
    breathing, deliberate pause before responding), (4) Clear contrast between old
    self (would have called Linda immediately) and new self (choosing to wait), (5)
    Mother noticing the difference (''Can''t it wait until morning?'' becomes a moment
    where Sophie makes a different choice). REQUIRED PHRASES: All 4 preserved exactly:
    ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare'' (present), ''How was Thailand? her mother
    asked'' (present), ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'' (present), ''It''s
    good to be home, she said'' (present). MINIMAL CHANGES: The revision is surgical—it
    keeps the original structure, dialogue beats, and setting intact while inserting
    transformation markers. Approximately 60% of original text remains verbatim or
    near-verbatim; changes are additive (internal monologue, behavioral choices) rather
    than structural rewrites. The mother, airport, work pressure elements all preserved
    and functional. QUALITY: Writing is polished with strong sensory details (''city
    lights blur past,'' ''ache in her chest felt new—quieter''), natural dialogue,
    and thematic coherence. No errors introduced. The revision elevates the segment
    from flat to meaningful while respecting all constraints.'
