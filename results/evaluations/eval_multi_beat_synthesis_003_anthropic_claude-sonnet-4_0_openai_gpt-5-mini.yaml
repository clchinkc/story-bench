  failed_items:
  - 'Word count outside required range: 515 words (required 700-1000).'
  - "Chekhov's Gun payoff is weak: a setup detail from Fun and Games (pressure-sensitive\
    \ floor / camera loop) is not clearly used as the critical solution during Bad\
    \ Guys Close In \u2014 the tech skills are reused but the earlier specific detail\
    \ isn't paid off as a traceable payoff."
  - 'Team friction is present but muted: conflict between crew members (beyond panic/hesitation)
    is not strongly developed, reducing emotional stakes in Beat 3.'
  - Tonal shift to explicit gallows humor in Beat 3 is subtle rather than pronounced.
