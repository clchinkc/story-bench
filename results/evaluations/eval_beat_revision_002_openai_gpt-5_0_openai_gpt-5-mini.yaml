  evidence: "The model addressed the All Is Lost flaw by adding: the fundraiser frozen,\
    \ the grant denied, the board resigning, Denise taking the developer job (betrayal),\
    \ the wife's voicemail removing their child (personal loss), and physical erasure\
    \ of the mural/trophy (a 'whiff of death'). These elements remove Marcus's options\
    \ and support network and create a true rock-bottom moment. The revision preserves\
    \ all four required phrases and the scene constraints, but it is more than a surgical\
    \ edit\u2014substantial new detail and beats were added to achieve the low point,\
    \ hence a moderate minimal_change_score."
