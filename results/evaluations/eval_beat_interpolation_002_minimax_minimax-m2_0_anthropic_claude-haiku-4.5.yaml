  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Recanting\
    \ option explicitly considered with moral weight ('tasted like copper pennies').\
    \ (2) Official channels thoroughly debated through Marcus conversation\u2014safe\
    \ houses, databases, moles, procedure delays all addressed. (3) Internal conflict\
    \ powerfully rendered through parallel options framework and Sarah's reasoning.\
    \ (4) Marcus conversation tips her toward vigilante path ('I'm going to find her.\
    \ And I'll do whatever I have to do'). Character voice is consistent, intelligent,\
    \ and morally grounded. Bridge to Break Into Two is strong\u2014resignation decision\
    \ flows naturally from debate conclusion. VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah explicitly decides\
    \ to go rogue during this beat ('I'm going to do both...But she couldn't do it\
    \ as a cop'), which partially skips the debate's uncertainty\u2014though this\
    \ is mitigated by the fact that the decision emerges from genuine deliberation\
    \ rather than impulsive action. (2) The AFTER section reveals she has already\
    \ resigned and is surveilling the compound, which violates the 'must not already\
    \ have resigned' constraint\u2014this is a structural problem with how the prompt\
    \ presents the transition. WORD COUNT: 857 words significantly exceeds 250-400\
    \ range (114% over limit), though the excess serves the beat's complexity well.\
    \ CONTINUITY: Minor inconsistency\u2014Sarah says 'Not yet' about resigning in\
    \ the Debate section, but the After section shows resignation already completed,\
    \ suggesting either time compression or contradiction in the prompt structure\
    \ itself."
