  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: The Ordeal was executed
    as a mere boss battle rather than a transformative psychological crisis. The revision
    precisely addresses all four required elements: (1) The dragon exploits Kira''s
    deepest fear by weaponizing her guilt over her brother''s death (''You let him
    die. You stood there while your brother burned''), (2) A clear death moment occurs
    when pinned by the dragon''s claws—''This was the moment of death—not just of
    her body, but of her spirit''—where Kira accepts her unworthiness, (3) Transformation
    is explicit: ''The girl who sought redemption was gone; a warrior who understood
    sacrifice remained'', (4) Victory comes from new understanding (''Acceptance washed
    over her'') rather than mere persistence. All four required phrases are preserved
    verbatim: opening line, creature description, dragon''s dialogue, and final collapse.
    The changes are surgical: the original battle sequence is retained but recontextualized
    through internal monologue and psychological depth. Approximately 60% of original
    phrasing remains intact, with insertions of introspective passages rather than
    wholesale rewrites. The revision maintains setting, outcome, and protagonist agency
    while fundamentally transforming the beat''s meaning. Minor: the phrase ''an earth-shaking
    roar'' appears as ''a earth-shaking roar'' (article error in original, preserved
    as-is). Writing quality is professional with strong emotional resonance and thematic
    coherence.'
