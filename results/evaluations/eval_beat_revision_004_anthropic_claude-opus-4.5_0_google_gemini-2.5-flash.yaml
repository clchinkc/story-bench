  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' for exposition. It completely rewrote the segment to demonstrate
    Rachel's traits, her relationship with James, and the setting through action,
    dialogue, and sensory details, rather than summary. This is a complete fix of
    the identified flaw. The changes were not minimal; it was a full rewrite, which
    was necessary to fix the 'telling' flaw.
