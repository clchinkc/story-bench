  evidence: 'All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-delineated: (1) Exposition
    establishes Samira''s 15-year reputation and the impossible virus discovery; (2)
    Rising Action depicts the 72-hour containment chaos and adaptive pathogen; (3)
    Climax peaks with Nexus confrontation and Samira''s decision to leak data; (4)
    Falling Action shows press conference, public cure release, and legal fallout;
    (5) Denouement resolves with Samira at peace on park bench, career sacrificed
    but equilibrium found. All 6 core elements preserved: protagonist (Samira), engineered
    virus, Raj (assistant), Nexus Biotech (antagonist), public cure release, career
    sacrifice. Structural accuracy is exceptional—the conversion successfully transforms
    3-act linearity into 5-act pyramid with clear escalation to climax and measured
    descent. Tone maintains medical thriller tension throughout with ethical weight
    particularly strong in climax and denouement. Minor deduction (0.05) for structural
    accuracy: the transition between Rising Action and Climax could be slightly more
    gradual, though the current sharp pivot effectively heightens tension. Minor deduction
    (0.05) for tone: denouement slightly softens thriller tension in favor of philosophical
    reflection, though this is appropriate for resolution phase.'
