  evidence: 'MODEL CORRECTLY DIAGNOSED THE FLAW: The revision precisely identified
    that the original segment lacked true ''All Is Lost'' devastation—it had too many
    remaining options and support systems. The model understood that the beat requires
    complete failure, isolation, and loss of identity/purpose. FLAW CORRECTION—FULLY
    EXECUTED: (1) Fundraiser destroyed: Daniels Foundation pulled pledge, competitors
    switched sides. (2) Grant rejected: Email arrives with rejection. (3) Personal
    betrayal/isolation: Wife leaves with children, citing missed recital and emotional
    abandonment; Denise resigns and accepts position elsewhere. (4) Genuine hopelessness:
    Marcus sits alone with no options—board already voted to suspend, locks changing
    Friday. (5) ''Whiff of death'': Metaphorical death of identity (15-year program
    ended, gym noise stops ''as if someone had shut a door inside his chest''). PRESERVATION:
    All 4 required phrases present verbatim: ''Marcus stared at the eviction notice
    in his hands,'' ''Thirty days to vacate the community center,'' ''"There has to
    be something we can do," said Denise,'' ''He rubbed his temples.'' All 4 story
    elements preserved: Marcus (protagonist), community center/youth program (setting),
    eviction (crisis), Denise (character). MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: While the revision
    is substantially expanded (365 vs 200-350 word limit), the changes are SURGICAL
    rather than wholesale rewrite. Original structure maintained: opening image →
    Denise dialogue → Marcus''s initial hope → cascading failures. New content inserted
    strategically: Denise''s revelation about foundation, grant rejection email, wife''s
    text, board decision, Denise''s resignation. Original text blocks preserved and
    integrated. QUALITY: Prose is professional, emotionally resonant, no new errors.
    Pacing accelerates appropriately for beat climax. Sensory details (''metal clink,''
    ''room tilted,'' ''flyer mockups looked obscene'') enhance devastation. CONSTRAINT
    VIOLATION: Word count exceeds maximum (365 vs 350 limit)—this is the only technical
    failure, though narratively justified by the complexity of multiple simultaneous
    failures required to fix the flaw.'
error: null
