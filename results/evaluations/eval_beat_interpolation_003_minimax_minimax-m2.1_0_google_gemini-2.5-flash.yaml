  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. Yuki explores multiple
    areas, discovers clues, encounters transformed crew, and overcomes an obstacle
    (running from them). The beat clearly functions as a 'Search' with struggle and
    incremental progress. All 'must not' items are avoided. Character and continuity
    are consistent, and the bridge to the next beat is strong.
