  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Alejandro reveals a vulnerable
    backstory, the relationship shifts from professional to personal, a shared intimate
    moment (storm, candles, meal, brief touch) creates genuine connection, and Maya
    explicitly chooses to stay for him rather than the money. None of the forbidden
    items appear (no pre-existing love, no decision to leave, no photograph, and Alejandro
    lowers his guard). The only deduction is that the scene exceeds the specified
    word-count range (632 words vs. required 300–450), so word_count_valid is false.'
