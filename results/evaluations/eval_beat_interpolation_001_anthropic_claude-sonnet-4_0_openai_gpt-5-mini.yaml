  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he provides practical wisdom and tangible tools (compass, satchel, vials); Marcus
    reframes Elena''s librarian skills as useful, and Elena''s doubt shifts toward
    reluctant acceptance (she still hesitates). None of the forbidden items appear:
    Elena does not become immediately confident, Marcus does not solve her problems
    or offer to accompany her, the scene is set in Holloway''s Curiosities not the
    forest, and Elena does not discover magical powers. Setting and character voices
    remain consistent, and the mentor scene cleanly bridges the earlier refusal and
    the later crossing of the threshold.'
