  evidence: 'All four target act-beats are clearly present (Setup with inciting letter
    and first plot point of going to Kyoto; Act 2A midpoint/temptation and Act 2B
    complications/uninviting leading to the second plot point; Act 3 apology/climax
    and denouement with the shop). All eight required elements are preserved. Minor
    deductions: the piece compresses some Act 2A/2B transitions (the midpoint and
    second plot point are close together, reducing some structural distinctness),
    and a few lines are slightly more explicit than the requested quietly restrained
    Japanese aesthetic, so tone and structural scores are slightly under perfect.
    Word count requirement is not met (document flagged as invalid per provided range).'
