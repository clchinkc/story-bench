  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Thomas conducts direct examination,\
    \ there is a clear moment where Dr. Okonkwo nearly recants (fear for her daughter),\
    \ Thomas takes decisive emotional/actionable steps to influence her decision,\
    \ and she ultimately chooses to testify\u2014providing the turning point where\
    \ truth prevails. No must-not conditions are violated. Character behavior and\
    \ courtroom continuity remain consistent with the before and after beats, so no\
    \ deductions were necessary."
