  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All four required elements present and well-executed. (1)\
    \ Maya discovers Alejandro's vulnerability through the paella memory\u2014his\
    \ father, mother's cooking, yearning for connection. (2) Relationship shifts from\
    \ professional to personal as he opens up emotionally and she responds with genuine\
    \ care. (3) Shared moment is the paella preparation and tasting, creating authentic\
    \ connection through food and memory. (4) Maya's internal commitment deepens beyond\
    \ contract motivation ('not just for the financial gain, but because she genuinely\
    \ cared'). The beat perfectly executes the Act 2 Midpoint function: raises emotional\
    \ stakes, shifts Maya from reactive (hired to cook) to proactive (choosing to\
    \ stay for him), and represents point of no return in emotional journey. All must-not\
    \ items avoided: they don't declare love or become overly intimate, Maya doesn't\
    \ decide to leave, the photograph isn't taken during this scene, and Alejandro's\
    \ walls genuinely lower. Seamless bridge between BEFORE (contract signing, financial\
    \ motivation) and AFTER (photograph scandal, forced separation). Setting continuity\
    \ maintained (kitchen, sunset, balcony mentioned in AFTER). MINOR DEDUCTION: Character\
    \ voice slightly shifts toward telling rather than showing in final paragraph\
    \ ('This was her point of no return'), though this is minimal and doesn't undermine\
    \ execution. Dialogue feels natural, pacing allows vulnerability to build organically."
