  evidence: "BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World\u2014Maya's coastal village\
    \ pottery teaching; (2) Call to Adventure\u2014dry spring, elders' request; (3)\
    \ Refusal of Call\u2014Maya offers other potters' names, doubts her capability;\
    \ (4) Meeting the Mentor\u2014Sura arrives with grandmother's walking stick and\
    \ story; (5) Crossing the Threshold\u2014Maya departs before dawn; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies\u2014\
    rain, shepherd (ally), heron, fear, cracked cup, doubts; (7) Approach to Inmost\
    \ Cave\u2014shrine discovery, finding grandmother's journal; (8) The Ordeal\u2014\
    kiln fire, learning to surrender control, vessel creation through the night; (9)\
    \ Reward\u2014completed vessel with unexpected form; (10) Road Back\u2014descent\
    \ with doubts, caravan encounter; (11) Resurrection\u2014spring ceremony, water\
    \ returns, old self washes away. MISSING: (12) Return with Elixir is implied but\
    \ underdeveloped\u2014the final paragraphs show teaching students and changed\
    \ practice, but lack explicit demonstration of how the elixir (surrender/listening)\
    \ transforms the community or creates lasting change beyond the spring's return.\
    \ PRESERVATION: All 7 elements fully intact\u2014Maya (protagonist), pottery (central),\
    \ grandmother's legacy (journal, walking stick, portraits), mountain shrine (detailed\
    \ journey), dried spring (catalyst and resolution), surrender theme (explicit\
    \ throughout), transformation (clear arc). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Strong adherence\
    \ to monomyth structure with clear progression, though the final beat feels compressed.\
    \ TONE: Exceptional\u2014meditative, lyrical language ('tide,' 'ghost-still vessels,'\
    \ 'clay speak') maintains quiet contemplation throughout. DEDUCTION: Word count\
    \ exceeds range by 208 words (26% over limit), which violates constraint. Missing\
    \ explicit final beat diminishes structural completeness slightly."
