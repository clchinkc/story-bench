  evidence: The model correctly identified the 'telling' vs 'showing' flaw and revised
    the segment to demonstrate Rachel's traits through action, dialogue, and sensory
    details. It shows her detective skills (observing James, cold case files), her
    relationship with James (wordless nod), her devotion to work (cold cases, ritual),
    and setting (precinct buzz, coffee taste). The changes were extensive, essentially
    a rewrite, rather than minimal surgical edits, hence the lower minimal_change_score.
    However, the quality of the revision is good, and it successfully addresses the
    core flaw. The 'unaware that this ordinary Tuesday held the spark that would soon
    unravel everything she knew' is a bit too on-the-nose for exposition, hinting
    at future plot rather than establishing the status quo, which slightly lowers
    the beat satisfaction score.
