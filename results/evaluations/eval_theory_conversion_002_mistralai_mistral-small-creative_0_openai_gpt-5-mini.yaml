  evidence: All 12 monomyth beats are present and appear in the correct sequence (Ordinary
    World through Return with Elixir). Minor deductions in structural_accuracy_score
    because the Refusal of the Call is conveyed as brief hesitation rather than an
    extended refusal, the Mentor is an indirect/inherited mentor (grandmother's journal)
    rather than a living guide, and the Tests/Allies/Enemies beat compresses allies/enemies
    into simple hardships rather than distinct figures. Tone is largely quiet, meditative,
    and transformative throughout; small deduction only because a few moments (e.g.,
    village cheering) introduce a slightly brighter note that lightly shifts mood.
    Word count is invalid per requirement (596; required 600–800).
