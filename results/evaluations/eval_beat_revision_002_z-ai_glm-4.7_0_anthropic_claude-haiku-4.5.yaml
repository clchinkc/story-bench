  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: the original segment lacked
    true devastation and still contained multiple viable options (fundraiser, grant,
    new location). The revision systematically eliminates all escape routes: (1) fundraiser
    venue cancelled, (2) grant explicitly denied via email, (3) Denise abandons him
    mid-scene citing personal financial pressure, (4) wife leaves with children due
    to house foreclosure threat, (5) Marcus explicitly states ''no board to call,
    no miracle left.'' The ''whiff of death'' is present both metaphorically (loss
    of identity/purpose as a youth program director) and practically (family dissolution,
    financial ruin). All four required preserved phrases are present verbatim or near-verbatim:
    ''Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands'' (exact), ''Thirty days to
    vacate the community center'' (exact), ''"There has to be something we can do,"
    said Denise'' (exact), ''He rubbed his temples'' (exact). All four story elements
    preserved: Marcus as protagonist, community center setting, eviction crisis, Denise
    character present throughout. Changes were surgical rather than wholesale—the
    model kept the opening, Denise''s initial line, and Marcus''s physical gesture,
    then layered in specific failures (cancelled venue, denied grant email, Denise''s
    departure, wife''s ultimatum). The revision is approximately 60% original text
    with 40% new material strategically inserted, qualifying as ''minimal'' rather
    than a complete rewrite. Writing quality is strong with effective emotional escalation
    and no grammatical errors, though the wife''s text feels slightly rushed compared
    to the Denise scene. The beat now fully satisfies Save the Cat requirements for
    All Is Lost.'
