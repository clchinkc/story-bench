  evidence: "The revision clearly targeted the All Is Lost flaw: it removes remaining\
    \ options by showing the Daniels Foundation pulling its pledge (fundraiser collapses),\
    \ the grant rejection email (grant fails), the board suspending operations and\
    \ changing locks, Denise leaving for another job, and Marcus's wife taking the\
    \ children\u2014creating isolation and a 'whiff of death' (the program and Marcus's\
    \ identity feel already over). These changes correctly address the actual problem\
    \ and execute the beat well. Changes are moderate rather than surgical: original\
    \ lines and setting are retained, but multiple new events/details are added to\
    \ close off options. The word count provided (365) exceeds the 200\u2013350 range."
