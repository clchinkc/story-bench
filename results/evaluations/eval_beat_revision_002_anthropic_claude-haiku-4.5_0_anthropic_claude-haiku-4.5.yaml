  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: the original segment lacked\
    \ true 'All Is Lost' devastation because Marcus retained multiple viable options\
    \ (fundraiser, grant, new location) and intact support systems. The revision systematically\
    \ eliminates all five required elements: (1) Grant rejected, (2) Fundraiser cancelled\
    \ with sponsor abandonment, (3) Denise's departure isolates Marcus professionally,\
    \ (4) Wife leaves, daughter unreachable\u2014family disintegration, (5) The at-risk\
    \ youth arrested\u2014metaphorical death of his life's purpose. The final image\
    \ of Marcus alone at a bare desk with 'no options, no team, no family, no program'\
    \ achieves the required emotional devastation and 'whiff of death.' All four required\
    \ phrases preserved verbatim: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands,'\
    \ 'Thirty days to vacate the community center,' '\"There has to be something we\
    \ can do,\" said Denise,' and 'He rubbed his temples.' All four story elements\
    \ preserved: Marcus as protagonist, community center setting, eviction crisis,\
    \ Denise's presence. Changes were surgical rather than wholesale\u2014the model\
    \ expanded the segment by adding specific rejections and losses rather than restructuring.\
    \ The writing quality is strong with no new errors; the emotional arc is now properly\
    \ calibrated to the beat definition. Minor deduction from minimal_change_score\
    \ (0.75 vs 1.0) because the revision added substantial new content (family conflict,\
    \ youth arrest, Denise's departure) rather than purely editing existing material,\
    \ though this was necessary to fix the flaw."
