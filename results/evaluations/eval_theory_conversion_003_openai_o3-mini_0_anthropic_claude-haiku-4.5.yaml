  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All four target beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Act 1 establishes Kenji''s hollow corporate world and the inciting incident (Yuki''s
    letter). Act 2A depicts obstacles in reconnecting with Yuki and introduces Haruki
    as sanctuary/guide. Act 2B escalates with the business deal temptation and confrontation
    with Yuki. Act 3 delivers climax (rejection of deal, apology) and denouement (bamboo
    shop transformation). All 8 core elements preserved: protagonist Kenji, lost career,
    estranged Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki craftsman, business temptation, theme of
    people over ambition, bamboo shop ending. Tone is consistently quiet, reflective,
    with Japanese aesthetic (shinkansen, bamboo, seasons, traditions). MINOR DEDUCTIONS:
    Structural accuracy slightly reduced (0.9 vs 1.0) because Act 2B''s second plot
    point could be more sharply defined—the confrontation with Yuki is powerful but
    the decision to reject the deal happens somewhat implicitly rather than as a crystalline
    turning point. Tone score near-perfect (0.95) with only minor note that some passages
    lean slightly philosophical rather than purely dramatic, though this fits the
    material well.'
