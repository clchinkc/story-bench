  evidence: 'All four required elements present: (1) Marcus Thorne introduced as mentor
    character with clear wisdom-keeper attributes; (2) practical wisdom delivered
    through compass gift and reframing Elena''s librarian skills as navigation/pattern-recognition;
    (3) Elena''s doubt shifts from ''I''m nobody'' to ''Maybe it hadn''t been entirely
    wrong'' showing reluctant acceptance; (4) explicit connection between cataloging/cross-referencing
    and forest survival. All must-not violations avoided: Elena remains doubtful and
    hesitant (not confident/eager), Marcus provides guidance but explicitly doesn''t
    accompany her or solve problems, setting is market district/shop (not forest),
    no magical powers discovered. Character voice maintains Elena''s self-doubt while
    showing subtle openness. Bridge between beats is seamless—Elena enters shop running
    from guilt, exits with compass and reframed perspective, leading naturally to
    threshold crossing. Continuity perfect: compass from GENERATED beat appears in
    AFTER beat, Marcus''s words echo in Elena''s mind, satchel described identically,
    location progression logical (market→forest edge).'
