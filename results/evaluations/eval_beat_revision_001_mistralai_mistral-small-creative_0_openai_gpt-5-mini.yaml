  evidence: 'The revision explicitly targets Kira''s deepest fear—guilt over her brother—by
    having the dragon taunt her with it and forcing an internal crisis. It introduces
    a psychological ''death'' (nearly breaking, confronting the identity that failed
    her) and a rebirth when she reframes her motive (fighting to stop being the girl
    who failed him), making victory stem from new understanding rather than sheer
    persistence. Changes are moderate: key sentences and outcome are preserved verbatim
    or nearly so, with added interiority and a few new lines to achieve the Ordeal.'
