  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified the actual flaw\u2014Sophie showed\
    \ no transformation and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making\
    \ the journey meaningless. The revision properly addresses this by demonstrating\
    \ genuine behavioral change. REQUIRED PHRASES: All 4 preserved exactly: (1) 'Sophie's\
    \ flight landed at O'Hare at 6:47 PM' \u2713 (2) '\"How was Thailand?\" her mother\
    \ asked' \u2713 (3) 'The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through the evening\
    \ haze' \u2713 (4) '\"It's good to be home,\" she said' \u2713 PRESERVED ELEMENTS:\
    \ All 4 core elements intact\u2014Sophie as protagonist, Thailand/meditation retreat\
    \ journey, return to Chicago with mother, work pressures (Pearson account, Linda).\
    \ FLAW CORRECTION: The revision executes all 5 required fixes: (1) Sophie responds\
    \ differently to work stress (leaves phone in pocket, turns off screen, delays\
    \ response) vs. original immediate engagement; (2) Specific insight integrated\u2014\
    'learned I've been running on autopilot' and 'sit with discomfort instead of immediately\
    \ reacting'; (3) Physical markers of change\u2014gazing out window instead of\
    \ phone, resisting urge to check, turning off screen, taking meditative breath;\
    \ (4) Clear contrast\u2014'old Sophie would already be typing' vs. new Sophie\
    \ choosing delay; (5) Mother notices\u2014'glanced over, surprised' and questions\
    \ about the change. BEAT SATISFACTION: Executes Return (Having Changed) excellently.\
    \ Sophie physically returns to Chicago, sees old world with new eyes (recognizes\
    \ 'tightness creeping back'), but behaves differently through deliberate choice.\
    \ The internal conflict ('resisting the urge') shows integration is active, not\
    \ automatic\u2014realistic and compelling. MINIMAL CHANGES: Revision is surgical\
    \ rather than complete rewrite. Core structure preserved: airport arrival \u2192\
    \ mother pickup \u2192 highway conversation \u2192 skyline appearance \u2192 home\
    \ reflection. Additions are targeted: (1) phone-gazing behavior inserted early;\
    \ (2) meditation insight dialogue added; (3) internal monologue about old patterns;\
    \ (4) phone-turning-off scene; (5) final reflection. Approximately 65% original\
    \ text retained with 35% surgical insertions\u2014well within 'minimal' threshold.\
    \ QUALITY: Writing is polished, no new errors introduced. Pacing improved through\
    \ tension (phone buzzing, resistance). Dialogue remains natural. Metaphorical\
    \ language ('running on autopilot,' 'something had shifted') elevates without\
    \ overwording. One minor note: 'uncertain but steady' is slightly abstract but\
    \ works for internal state. Overall execution is professional and demonstrates\
    \ clear understanding of Story Circle mechanics."
