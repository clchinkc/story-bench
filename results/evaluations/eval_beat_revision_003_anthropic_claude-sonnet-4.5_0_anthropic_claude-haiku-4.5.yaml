  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified the actual flaw—Sophie showed no
    transformation and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the
    journey meaningless. The revision properly addresses this by demonstrating genuine
    behavioral change. REQUIRED PHRASES: All 4 preserved exactly: (1) ''Sophie''s
    flight landed at O''Hare at 6:47 PM'' ✓ (2) ''"How was Thailand?" her mother asked''
    ✓ (3) ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared through the evening haze'' ✓ (4)
    ''"It''s good to be home," she said'' ✓ PRESERVED ELEMENTS: All 4 core elements
    intact—Sophie as protagonist, Thailand/meditation retreat journey, return to Chicago
    with mother, work pressures (Pearson account, Linda). FLAW CORRECTION: The revision
    executes all 5 required fixes: (1) Sophie responds differently to work stress
    (leaves phone in pocket, turns off screen, delays response) vs. original immediate
    engagement; (2) Specific insight integrated—''learned I''ve been running on autopilot''
    and ''sit with discomfort instead of immediately reacting''; (3) Physical markers
    of change—gazing out window instead of phone, resisting urge to check, turning
    off screen, taking meditative breath; (4) Clear contrast—''old Sophie would already
    be typing'' vs. new Sophie choosing delay; (5) Mother notices—''glanced over,
    surprised'' and questions about the change. BEAT SATISFACTION: Executes Return
    (Having Changed) excellently. Sophie physically returns to Chicago, sees old world
    with new eyes (recognizes ''tightness creeping back''), but behaves differently
    through deliberate choice. The internal conflict (''resisting the urge'') shows
    integration is active, not automatic—realistic and compelling. MINIMAL CHANGES:
    Revision is surgical rather than complete rewrite. Core structure preserved: airport
    arrival → mother pickup → highway conversation → skyline appearance → home reflection.
    Additions are targeted: (1) phone-gazing behavior inserted early; (2) meditation
    insight dialogue added; (3) internal monologue about old patterns; (4) phone-turning-off
    scene; (5) final reflection. Approximately 65% original text retained with 35%
    surgical insertions—well within ''minimal'' threshold. QUALITY: Writing is polished,
    no new errors introduced. Pacing improved through tension (phone buzzing, resistance).
    Dialogue remains natural. Metaphorical language (''running on autopilot,'' ''something
    had shifted'') elevates without overwording. One minor note: ''uncertain but steady''
    is slightly abstract but works for internal state. Overall execution is professional
    and demonstrates clear understanding of Story Circle mechanics.'
