  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Marcus
    introduced as mentor with clear characterization (''once-adventurer turned keeper''),
    (2) practical wisdom provided through both verbal guidance (''path chooses us'')
    and tangible tools (worn leather notebook, compass), (3) Elena''s doubt shifts
    convincingly toward reluctant acceptance (''hesitant spark of resolve''), (4)
    librarian skills reframed as valuable (''catalogue not just pages but wisdom of
    ages''). Beat function clearly executed—mentor provides preparation without solving
    problems or accompanying. All must-not items avoided: Elena remains doubtful (''doubts
    stirring beneath surface''), mentor doesn''t accompany her, setting is curiosity
    shop (not forest), no magical powers discovered. MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Character voice
    slightly generic in places (''warm amber eyes seemed to know more than he let
    on'' is somewhat clichéd mentor trope language, -0.05 character score). Bridge
    between beats is strong but could more explicitly reference the map/grandmother''s
    ghost for tighter continuity (-0.1 bridge score). Setting continuity excellent—shop
    location makes sense as transition point before forest threshold. Word count 279
    is well within 200-350 range.'
