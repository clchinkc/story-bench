  evidence: 'ELEMENTS FOUND: (1) Sarah considers recanting testimony implicitly through
    the weight of her decision; (2) Sarah explicitly considers going to Marcus/official
    channels and consciously rejects this path; (3) Strong internal conflict between
    duty (badge/system) vs. sister (Amy''s safety). MISSING ELEMENT: No moment or
    conversation that tips her toward the third option (going rogue)—the decision
    appears to crystallize internally without a clear catalyst within the Debate beat
    itself. VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah has already decided to go rogue by mid-passage (''she
    would take matters into her own hands''), which skips the debate''s function of
    wrestling with the decision; (2) The AFTER section reveals she HAS already resigned
    and is acting as a vigilante, suggesting the Debate beat failed to maintain the
    protagonist still being undecided. CHARACTER: Sarah''s voice is consistent—methodical,
    conflicted, determined. However, her rapid pivot from ''making up her mind'' to
    already being a vigilante feels rushed. BRIDGE: The transition from Debate to
    Break Into Two is awkward because Sarah''s decision point is muddled—she decides
    mid-Debate rather than at its conclusion, weakening the beat''s narrative function.
    CONTINUITY: Setting remains consistent (kitchen to outside captain''s office),
    but the timeline compression is jarring. The Debate should show her wrestling;
    instead it shows her deciding and then acting.'
