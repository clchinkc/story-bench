  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie not showing
    any change upon her return. It introduced specific behavioral changes (responding
    differently to work, putting phone on DND), internal reflection (noticing surroundings,
    feeling her heartbeat), and her mother's implicit observation of her new calm.
    The changes were surgical and integrated well into the existing narrative structure,
    maintaining the original flow while significantly altering the character's response
    to her environment. The required phrases were all present, and the forbidden changes
    were avoided.
