  evidence: The 'Climax' section feels a bit stretched, encompassing both the revelation
    of Nexus's involvement and the confrontation with them. While both are high-tension
    points, a true Freytag climax is usually a single turning point. Here, it's more
    of a sequence of climactic events. However, all beats are present and the story
    flows well through them. The word count is significantly over the requested range.
