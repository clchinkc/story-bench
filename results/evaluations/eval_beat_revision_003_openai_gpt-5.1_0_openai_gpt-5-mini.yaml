  evidence: 'The model appears to have addressed the missing ''Return (Having Changed)''
    beat by giving Sophie a clear, applied insight from the retreat (the teacher''s
    line: ''Notice the urge. Breathe. Choose.''), showing changed behavior (locks
    the screen, slips the phone into her bag, lets notifications buzz), and including
    an external acknowledgment of change (mother: ''That''s new''). This creates a
    visible contrast between pre- and post-journey Sophie and integrates the retreat
    into her choices. All four required elements and required phrases are preserved.
    Changes were more than surgical but still moderate and targeted—several new sentences
    and internal beats were added to demonstrate transformation, while overall structure
    and key lines remain intact.'
