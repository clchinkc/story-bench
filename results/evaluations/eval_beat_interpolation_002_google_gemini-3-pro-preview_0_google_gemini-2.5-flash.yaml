  evidence: The generated text perfectly captures the Debate beat. Sarah considers
    recanting, then going to the authorities, and finally, through internal conflict
    and a conversation with Marcus, commits to a third, 'rogue' option. All required
    elements are present, and all 'must not' conditions are avoided. The character's
    internal struggle and the progression of her decision-making are well-executed,
    leading directly into the 'Break into Two' beat.
