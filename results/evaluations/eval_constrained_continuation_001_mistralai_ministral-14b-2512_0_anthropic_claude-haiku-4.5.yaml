  failed_constraints:
  - 'CRITICAL: Word count 1661 exceeds maximum of 700 by 961 words (137% over limit)'
  - 'MISSING: Zara confronting her fear of failure (not just physical danger) - while
    she has internal doubt moments, there''s no clear confrontation with the core
    fear of inadequacy; the narrative focuses more on physical challenges and external
    threats than psychological reckoning'
  strengths:
  - Both required beats (Approach to Inmost Cave, The Ordeal) are clearly present
    and well-executed
  - Excellent tension and pacing throughout with desperate hope woven in
  - "Strong choice moment: Zara choosing to help Tom\xE1s despite danger (constraint\
    \ met)"
  - 'Trap/test requiring thief skills: Guardian encounter and net mechanics (constraint
    met)'
  - "Tom\xE1s's revelation about being a scribe/historian with hidden knowledge (constraint\
    \ met)"
  - 'Symbolic death/rebirth: Guardian defeat and transformation of understanding (constraint
    met)'
  - 'Zara emerges changed: shifts from physical strength to intellectual/perceptive
    power (constraint met)'
  - "All forbidden elements successfully avoided - no cure found, no romance, Tom\xE1\
    s survives, no supernatural abilities for Zara"
  - Tone is consistently tense with moral complexity and desperate hope
  - 'Ending delivers complication: symbols/riddle ahead suggests new challenge beyond
    the Ordeal'
  - Excellent character voice and visceral action sequences
  weaknesses:
  - Severely exceeds word count constraint - nearly 2.4x the maximum allowed
  - Fear of failure confrontation is implicit rather than explicit - Zara doubts herself
    but doesn't directly confront the core psychological fear
  - The narrative could be tightened significantly without losing impact
  - Some redundancy in action sequences that could be condensed
  overall_assessment: Exceptional storytelling with professional-quality prose, complete
    beat coverage, and all required elements present except one. However, the critical
    word count violation (1661 vs 700 max) is a major constraint failure that cannot
    be overlooked. The missing explicit fear-of-failure confrontation is a secondary
    issue. If word count were within range, this would score 0.9+; the violation drops
    it significantly.
