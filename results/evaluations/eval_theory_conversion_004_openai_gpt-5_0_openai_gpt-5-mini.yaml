  evidence: 'All eight target beats are present and clearly mapped. Seven of eight
    required elements are fully preserved: Zoe, the library/oral-history program,
    Ms. Okafor, Bernard Park, Zoe''s social anxiety, the town-hall presentation, and
    Bernard''s death. The journalism-school element is only implied (applications
    started) rather than shown as a concluded outcome, so it was marked partial. The
    ''Take/pay price'' beat is implemented as Zoe accepting public responsibility
    (town hall) but lacks a clear cost or sacrifice beyond emotional exposure, so
    that reduced structural accuracy slightly. The provided conversion also exceeds
    the requested word-count range.'
