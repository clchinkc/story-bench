  evidence: "REQUIRED ELEMENTS (4/4 present): (1) Multiple station areas explored\u2014\
    crew quarters, medical bay, mess hall, corridors, core location\u2014showing systematic\
    \ search pattern. (2) Clues discovered progressively: sealed biometric locks,\
    \ erratic energy signatures, medical logs mentioning 'dimensional integration,'\
    \ oxygen mix anomalies, sabotaged generators, altered machinery. (3) Transformed\
    \ crew encountered mysteriously\u2014formless shadow coalescing into human-like\
    \ shimmer, overlapping whispers, dissolving into smoke, edges shimmering like\
    \ water. Identity unclear until final beat. (4) Obstacles overcome: sealed doors,\
    \ failing systems, sabotaged generators, the station itself 'guiding' her, the\
    \ transformed entity blocking her path. MUST-NOT ITEMS (0/4 violations): Yuki\
    \ does NOT immediately find the core (it appears only in AFTER beat). Transformed\
    \ crew does NOT explain everything\u2014only cryptic warning 'You shouldn't be\
    \ here.' Yuki does NOT decide to leave; she persists despite obstacles. Yuki does\
    \ NOT know about dimensional transformation beforehand; she discovers it through\
    \ environmental clues and the mysterious encounter. BEAT EXECUTION: Perfectly\
    \ executes the Search beat\u2014active navigation, trial-and-error adaptation,\
    \ incremental discovery, mounting tension, protagonist struggling to understand\
    \ while progressing toward goal. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Yuki maintains scientific\
    \ rigor (diagnostics, protocols, data analysis) while showing appropriate fear\
    \ and determination. Voice remains consistent with BEFORE beat. BRIDGE QUALITY:\
    \ Seamless transition from 'Go' (arrival) to 'Search' (exploration) to 'Find'\
    \ (core discovery). Each beat flows naturally. CONTINUITY: Setting details align\
    \ perfectly\u2014red emergency lighting, Jupiter viewport, station systems, crew\
    \ count. No contradictions. WORD COUNT ISSUE: 557 words exceeds 400-word maximum\
    \ by 157 words (39% over), representing the only quantifiable deficiency."
