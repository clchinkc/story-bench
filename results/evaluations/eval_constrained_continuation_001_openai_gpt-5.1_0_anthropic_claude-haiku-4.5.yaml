  failed_constraints:
  - 'CRITICAL: Word count 1340 exceeds maximum of 700 by 640 words (91% over limit)'
  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - '✓ Approach to the Inmost Cave: Service tunnel descent, Gate of Teeth mechanism,
      escalating pursuit'
    - '✓ The Ordeal: The Maw pit with shifting sand, physical and psychological death/rebirth,
      emergence transformed'
    must_include_detail:
    - '✓ Choice between escape and helping Tomás: Grate scene where Zara could slip
      through alone but instead grabs his cloak'
    - '✓ Trap requiring thief skills: Gate of Teeth lock mechanism solved through
      tactile reading; Maw sand currents mapped through observation and weight distribution'
    - '✓ Tomás''s true motivation revealed: Guilt over broken oath, desire for redemption,
      parallel to Zara''s fear of failure'
    - '✓ Zara confronting fear of failure: Extended internal monologue about becoming
      the story told about her, mother''s trust, proving herself real'
    - '✓ Symbolic death/rebirth: Drowning in sand, stillness as survival technique,
      emergence as ''harder, more deliberate'' version of self'
    - '✓ Zara changed by Ordeal: Explicitly stated—''the part of her that waited for
      others to rescue her...had drowned back there'''
    must_not_detail:
    - ✓ No cure found (saved for later narrative)
    - ✓ No romantic subplot (relationship remains mentor/ally with emotional depth
      but no romance)
    - ✓ Tomás survives (both characters reach the balcony alive)
    - ✓ No magic/supernatural abilities (all solutions use thief skills, physics,
      psychology)
    tone_assessment: Excellent execution of tense, morally complex tone. Desperation
      balanced with agency. Moments of hope (Tomás's vulnerability, Zara's determination)
      interspersed with genuine danger. Internal conflict matches external stakes.
      Minor deduction only for occasional slight melodrama in mother-memory sequences.
    ending_assessment: Perfect execution. Zara has demonstrably passed the Ordeal
      (emerged transformed, survived the Maw). New complication introduced (Scorpion
      Guild blocking exit on balcony). Sets up next beat (Resurrection/confrontation).
      Maintains tension and forward momentum.
    strengths:
    - Masterful integration of all 6 required elements without feeling forced
    - Psychological depth matches action sequences
    - Zara's character arc within this section is complete and earned
    - Excellent use of sensory detail (sand, dust, metal, cold)
    - Tomás's revelation reframes both characters' motivations
    - Ending complication is organic, not arbitrary
    critical_issue: Word count violation is severe. At 1340 words, the piece is 91%
      over the 700-word maximum. This is a hard constraint failure that cannot be
      overlooked despite exceptional quality. The story would need substantial cutting
      (approximately 640 words removed) to meet requirements. Quality does not override
      quantitative constraints.
  overall_score: 0.4
  score_justification: Despite exceptional narrative quality, thematic integration,
    and complete fulfillment of all qualitative requirements, the word count violation
    is a critical hard constraint failure. The piece exceeds the maximum by 640 words
    (91% over). In constraint-based evaluation, hard limits cannot be waived by quality.
    The story would score 0.95+ if word count were valid, but the violation forces
    a weak score. This demonstrates the importance of editing to specification before
    submission.
