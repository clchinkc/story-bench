  failed_items:
  - 'Fun and Games: Introduction of an unexpected complication (minor) - The complication
    introduced (painting is the alarm) is major, not minor, and immediately derails
    the plan, making it feel more like a Midpoint complication than a minor Fun and
    Games one.'
  - 'Midpoint: False victory: a key objective achieved - While Miri *thinks* she has
    the painting, the immediate revelation that it''s a tracking device undermines
    the ''false victory'' feeling. It''s more of an immediate failure than a moment
    of perceived success.'
  - 'Midpoint: Miri discovers her mentor is involved (or the full extent) - The mentor
    is spotted at the end of the Midpoint, but the *full extent* of her involvement
    isn''t really explored or revealed here beyond her presence.'
  - 'Bad Guys Close In: Team friction or trust issues surface - While Luca questions
    Miri''s priorities, it doesn''t quite escalate to ''friction or trust issues''
    in a way that significantly impacts the plot or their immediate actions.'
  - 'Bad Guys Close In: The walls literally and figuratively closing in - While there''s
    danger, the ''walls closing in'' isn''t as palpable. They manage to escape relatively
    quickly, and the sense of being trapped isn''t fully realized.'
  - 'Cross-beat constraint: Chekhov''s Gun - While Oscar''s tech and Luca''s skills
    are used, there isn''t a clear ''Chekhov''s Gun'' moment where a specific, seemingly
    minor detail from Fun and Games becomes critical in Bad Guys Close In. The Taser
    is used, but it''s a primary tool, not a subtle setup. The ''borrowed'' boat is
    a new element, not a setup from earlier.'
