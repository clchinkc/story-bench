  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The beat's narrative
    function is clearly met, showing a pivotal shift in their relationship and Maya's
    commitment. No 'must not' items were violated. Character voices are consistent,
    and the scene seamlessly bridges the 'BEFORE' and 'AFTER' beats while maintaining
    setting continuity.
