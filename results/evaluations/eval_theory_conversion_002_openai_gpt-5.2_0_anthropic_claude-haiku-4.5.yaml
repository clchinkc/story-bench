  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS (12/12 present): 1) Ordinary World—coastal village pottery
    life, quiet contentment; 2) Call to Adventure—elders request ceremonial vessel
    for dried spring; 3) Refusal—Maya''s self-doubt, ''I am not her,'' resolution
    to stay; 4) Meeting the Mentor—grandmother''s journal, pendant, remembered guidance
    (''Clay remembers''); 5) Crossing Threshold—departure from village, dunes to inland
    air, point of no return; 6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—rain/slipping (tests), herder
    sharing path (ally), loneliness/doubt (enemies), mountain indifference; 7) Approach
    to Inmost Cave—reaching ruins, finding journal, reading final entry; 8) Ordeal—clay
    work at shrine, surrender struggle, vessel creation through night; 9) Reward—finished
    vessel warm in arms, understanding of new way; 10) Road Back—descent with vessel,
    rain, near-slip, temptation to abandon it; 11) Resurrection—spring flows, moment
    of transformation, elders witness; 12) Return with Elixir—Maya returns changed,
    village drinks transformed water, new understanding of making and being made.
    PRESERVATION (7/7): Maya protagonist ✓, pottery central ✓, grandmother''s legacy
    ✓, mountain shrine ✓, dried spring problem ✓, surrender theme ✓, transformation
    ✓. DEDUCTIONS: Word count 1769 exceeds target range 600-800 by 121% (major structural
    constraint violation, though content quality is exceptional). Structural accuracy
    slightly reduced (0.95 not 1.0) because the conversion prioritizes literary depth
    over strict beat economy—some beats blend or extend beyond typical monomyth pacing.
    Tone maintained throughout with meditative, quiet voice and transformative arc.
    Conversion successfully translates Story Circle''s circular 8-step structure into
    Hero''s Journey''s linear 12-stage progression while preserving thematic integrity
    and emotional resonance.'
