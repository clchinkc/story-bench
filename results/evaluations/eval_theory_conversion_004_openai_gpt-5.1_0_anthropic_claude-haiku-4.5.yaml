  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated.
    (1) You: Opening establishes Zoe''s comfort zone in library stacks, her anxiety,
    her hiding. (2) Need: Ms. Okafor identifies what''s missing—Zoe''s voice, her
    courage to connect. (3) Go: Zoe accepts the recorder and enters the oral history
    program. (4) Search: Multiple interviews show her learning to listen, adapt, notice
    silence and emotion. (5) Find: Bernard''s breakthrough moment—''You ask questions
    like you''re afraid to, but you still ask''—and his war story reveal the power
    of listening. (6) Take: Town hall presentation is the price paid—public vulnerability,
    speaking Bernard''s story aloud. (7) Return: Post-summer life resumes; Zoe back
    at library but changed. (8) Change: Final scenes demonstrate transformation—college
    essays, café interaction, auditorium speech show she''s now capable of her own
    voice. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral
    history program, Ms. Okafor (initiator), Bernard Park (key relationship), social
    anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic moment), Bernard''s
    death (emotional anchor), journalism school ending (future trajectory). Tone is
    consistently gentle, intimate, emotionally true—internal monologue, sensory detail
    (''shoes on wrong feet,'' ''red button a single insistent eye''), and earned emotional
    beats. DEDUCTIONS: Word count (1353) significantly exceeds target range (500-700),
    representing 93% overage. This violates the constraint but doesn''t diminish narrative
    quality. Structural accuracy near-perfect; minor deduction only for length violation
    affecting pacing expectations. Tone maintained throughout with no lapses.'
