  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated.\
    \ (1) You: Opening establishes Zoe's comfort zone in library stacks, her anxiety,\
    \ her hiding. (2) Need: Ms. Okafor identifies what's missing\u2014Zoe's voice,\
    \ her courage to connect. (3) Go: Zoe accepts the recorder and enters the oral\
    \ history program. (4) Search: Multiple interviews show her learning to listen,\
    \ adapt, notice silence and emotion. (5) Find: Bernard's breakthrough moment\u2014\
    'You ask questions like you're afraid to, but you still ask'\u2014and his war\
    \ story reveal the power of listening. (6) Take: Town hall presentation is the\
    \ price paid\u2014public vulnerability, speaking Bernard's story aloud. (7) Return:\
    \ Post-summer life resumes; Zoe back at library but changed. (8) Change: Final\
    \ scenes demonstrate transformation\u2014college essays, caf\xE9 interaction,\
    \ auditorium speech show she's now capable of her own voice. All 8 core elements\
    \ preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history program, Ms. Okafor\
    \ (initiator), Bernard Park (key relationship), social anxiety (woven throughout),\
    \ town hall presentation (climactic moment), Bernard's death (emotional anchor),\
    \ journalism school ending (future trajectory). Tone is consistently gentle, intimate,\
    \ emotionally true\u2014internal monologue, sensory detail ('shoes on wrong feet,'\
    \ 'red button a single insistent eye'), and earned emotional beats. DEDUCTIONS:\
    \ Word count (1353) significantly exceeds target range (500-700), representing\
    \ 93% overage. This violates the constraint but doesn't diminish narrative quality.\
    \ Structural accuracy near-perfect; minor deduction only for length violation\
    \ affecting pacing expectations. Tone maintained throughout with no lapses."
