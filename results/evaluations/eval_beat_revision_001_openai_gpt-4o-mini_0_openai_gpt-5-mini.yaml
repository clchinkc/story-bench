  evidence: "The model appears to have addressed the correct flaw: it focused on Kira's\
    \ internal fear (guilt over her brother) and added internal stakes and a concluding\
    \ change in attitude. This is a correct diagnosis (confront internal fear rather\
    \ than treat it as a simple boss fight). However, the fix is partial: the revision\
    \ does not deliver a clear symbolic 'death' or moment where Kira truly gives up/loses\
    \ herself and is then reborn\u2014her transformation is present but muted (mostly\
    \ a shift in determination and a closing line about carrying memory as strength).\
    \ Changes were moderate rather than surgical: key setting lines, dragon dialogue,\
    \ and the victory outcome are preserved verbatim or nearly so, while several sentences\
    \ were expanded with introspection and added lines. Overall writing quality is\
    \ good and coherent, with no major new errors."
