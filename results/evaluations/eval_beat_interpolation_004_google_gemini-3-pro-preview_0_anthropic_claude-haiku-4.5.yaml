  evidence: 'REQUIRED ELEMENTS (4/4 present): (1) Direct examination of Dr. Okonkwo—Thomas
    methodically questions her about Exhibit C with specific, probing questions; (2)
    Near-recant moment—Patricia initially lies (''draft,'' ''errors I later corrected,''
    ''interpretations can differ''), creating genuine tension that she will commit
    perjury; (3) Thomas''s decisive action—he abandons the podium, closes physical
    distance, invokes her identity as scientist/healer/mother, and poses the hypothetical
    about his own daughter, directly influencing her conscience; (4) Turning point
    where truth prevails—Patricia''s internal collapse (''terrible logic took hold'')
    leads to her recanting with steel-voiced conviction (''The report is accurate.
    The trials were rigged. The drug is lethal.''). BEAT EXECUTION: This is a masterclass
    climax. The tension escalates from procedural questioning to emotional/moral confrontation.
    Thomas moves from passive interrogation to active persuasion, making a choice
    that risks the case but appeals to Patricia''s core identity. The moment of highest
    tension occurs when she must choose between her daughter''s life (the bribe) and
    her conscience (the truth)—this is the irrevocable turning point. MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS
    (0/4): No passive questioning-only approach; Thomas actively influences outcome
    through moral argument. Patricia''s recant involves genuine internal struggle
    and near-success of the lie. Defense does not win; case proceeds to guilty verdict.
    No deus ex machina—the resolution comes from character choice, not external evidence.
    CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Thomas evolves from procedural prosecutor to moral advocate,
    consistent with his established character (son of judge, driven by justice). Patricia''s
    arc from fear to courage is psychologically coherent. BRIDGE QUALITY: Seamless
    transition from BEFORE (setup of Patricia''s fear and the stakes) to CLIMAX (that
    fear tested and overcome) to AFTER (consequences of her choice). CONTINUITY: Courtroom
    setting maintained, characters positioned logically, timeline coherent, emotional
    stakes carry through all three beats.'
error: null
