  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Act 1 establishes Kenji''s loss and introduces the inciting incident (Yuki''s
    letter) with strong emotional weight. Act 2A develops obstacles through clumsy
    reconnection attempts and introduces Haruki as a transformative figure. Act 2B
    escalates with the business deal temptation and Yuki''s confrontation. Act 3 delivers
    climax (standing outside the wedding) and denouement (bamboo shop). All 8 core
    elements preserved: protagonist, career loss, estranged daughter, Kyoto wedding,
    Haruki, business temptation, theme of people over ambition, bamboo shop ending.
    Tone is consistently quiet, contemplative, with strong Japanese aesthetic (bamboo
    imagery, tea ceremony, lanterns, futon, garden). Redemptive arc is earned and
    subtle. DEDUCTIONS: Word count exceeds target range by 118 words (868 vs. 550-750
    max), which violates the constraint. Structural accuracy slightly reduced because
    the conversion could more explicitly label transitions between acts. Tone is nearly
    perfect but could be marginally more restrained in a few passages (e.g., ''the
    paper trembling faintly'' is slightly more dramatic than the quiet aesthetic demands).'
