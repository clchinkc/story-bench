  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Marcus\
    \ introduced as mentor with clear characterization (curio shop owner, knowing\
    \ demeanor, twinkling eyes); (2) Practical wisdom provided ('forest tests intentions,\
    \ not abilities,' 'trust what you know') plus tangible gifts (satchel, compass,\
    \ tea); (3) Elena's doubt shifts convincingly from skepticism to curiosity ('initial\
    \ skepticism slowly giving way to curiosity'); (4) Librarian skills implicitly\
    \ validated through Marcus's comment about 'noticing fraying edges' and seeing\
    \ 'threads.' All must-not violations avoided: Elena remains uncertain/reluctant,\
    \ Marcus doesn't accompany her or solve problems, setting is shop (not forest),\
    \ no magical powers discovered. Character voice consistent\u2014Elena remains\
    \ vulnerable and questioning. Bridge between beats is strong: BEFORE shows refusal,\
    \ GENERATED shows acceptance beginning, AFTER shows her at threshold ready to\
    \ cross. Minor deductions: (1) Character score -0.05 for Marcus feeling slightly\
    \ archetypal/generic in delivery, though this is appropriate for mentor role;\
    \ (2) Bridge score -0.1 because the transition between GENERATED and AFTER skips\
    \ the actual decision moment (though this may be intentional narrative pacing);\
    \ (3) Continuity score -0.05 for minor temporal ambiguity ('previous day's events'\
    \ not explicitly connected to grandmother scene, though context is clear). Overall\
    \ execution is professional and meets all calibration standards for 'Exceptional'\
    \ range."
