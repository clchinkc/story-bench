  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive
    reasoning. The model accurately recognized all five key requirements were satisfied:
    (1) follows major defeat (gallery closure), (2) protagonist isolated (dark apartment,
    unanswered calls), (3) genuine despair and reflection (sitting on floor, tears,
    failed promises), (4) no solutions presented (only wallowing), and (5) whiff of
    death element (mother''s hospice memory). The model demonstrated strong beat understanding
    by explaining why each requirement was met and avoided the false positive of over-diagnosing
    problems. The explanation was thorough, specific to the text, and correctly calibrated
    to the Dark Night of the Soul beat definition.'
