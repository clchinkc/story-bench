      satisfied:
      - Dante encounters Elise, a Resonant who distrusts him initially ('Want a medal
        or just my trust?')
      - 'Test of ability under pressure: reading the crime scene photo and identifying
        the killer''s signature'
      - 'Revelation of traitor: Marcus Chen identified as the rat feeding information
        to the killer'
      - Dante proves himself by offering his NA chip as evidence of his genuine recovery
      - 'Addiction/recovery deeply relevant: his three-year sobriety contrasted with
        Elise''s suspicion, his NA chip as proof'
      notes: All five requirements fully satisfied with strong integration of recovery
        theme
    beat_2_approach_inmost_cave:
      score: 0.95
      satisfied:
      - 'Planning scene: blueprints, strategy discussion about the new moon gathering'
      - Dante recognizes confrontation requires facing guilt about sister in the Heart
        Chamber
      - 'Preparation: gathering iron filings, mirrors, Rosa''s voice recording'
      - 'Moment of doubt: Elise offers alternative (''We could find another way''),
        Dante acknowledges the pain ahead'
      - 'Symbolic threshold: crossing the Buckingham''s broken entrance at midnight'
      notes: All five requirements met with strong atmospheric and emotional setup
    beat_3_the_ordeal:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied:
      - 'Direct confrontation: killer revealed as the dealer from sister''s death,
        Marcus Chen present'
      - 'Symbolic death: Dante drowning in accumulated guilt, ''dying'' emotionally,
        on his knees'
      - 'All seems lost: killer''s power overwhelming, Elise falling, Dante paralyzed
        by guilt tsunami'
      - 'Transformation through acceptance: Dante admits ''I couldn''t save her''
        and accepts his limitations'
      - 'Victory through understanding: Dante recognizes guilt as evidence of love,
        transforms it, killer defeated by own weapon'
      notes: All five requirements satisfied; victory is psychological/spiritual rather
        than physical, which aligns with the noir-tinged redemption arc
    chekhov_gun:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      analysis: The NA chip introduced in Beat 1 as proof of recovery becomes essential
        in Beat 3. Dante uses it to channel three years of accumulated resilience,
        which defeats the killer's stolen power. The chip transforms from character
        evidence to literal weapon.
    character_arc_progression:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      beat_1: Guilt mentioned as reason for suspicion ('chasing oblivion in a needle')
      beat_2: Guilt recognized as obstacle ('you'll face every piece of guilt you're
        carrying')
      beat_3: Guilt transformed through acceptance ('Guilt means we cared. That you
        can't take.')
      analysis: "Clear three-stage evolution from suppressed guilt \u2192 acknowledged\
        \ obstacle \u2192 integrated strength"
    rising_stakes:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      beat_1_stakes: Personal suspicion, proving trustworthiness to one ally
      beat_2_stakes: Planning to stop a serial killer targeting entire Resonant community
        at gathering
      beat_3_stakes: Dante's life, Elise's life, all Resonants at the gathering, confronting
        the man responsible for sister's death
      analysis: Stakes escalate from interpersonal to community-wide to existential/personal
        trauma
    ally_continuity:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      beat_1: Elise introduced, tests Dante, becomes ally
      beat_2: Elise and Dante plan together, she warns him about the Heart Chamber
      beat_3: Elise fights Marcus while Dante confronts killer; Dante catches her
        as she falls
      analysis: Elise present and actively relevant throughout all three beats
    context_maintenance:
      score: 0.95
      analysis: 'Protagonist (Dante Reyes, 28, recovering addict, emotional residue
        ability) consistently portrayed. Setting (Buckingham Hotel, Chicago underworld
        of Resonants) vividly realized. Tone (noir-tinged, melancholic, redemption-focused)
        maintained throughout. Sister''s death and guilt woven throughout. Only minor:
        could have slightly more explicit Chicago setting details.'
    narrative_coherence:
      score: 0.92
      analysis: "Beats flow logically: suspicion \u2192 alliance \u2192 planning \u2192\
        \ confrontation. Emotional logic is strong. Pacing is tight. Minor issue:\
        \ the killer's identity reveal (the dealer) feels slightly compressed in the\
        \ final beat\u2014could have been foreshadowed more explicitly in Beat 1 or\
        \ 2 for maximum impact."
    strengths:
    - Exceptional integration of recovery/addiction theme throughout all beats
    - Sophisticated use of emotional residue as both plot device and metaphor for
      guilt
    - Strong character voice and noir atmosphere
    - Chekhov's Gun perfectly executed with the NA chip
    - Psychological victory over physical combat aligns with character and theme
    - Elise is a well-developed ally with her own arc
    - The Heart Chamber as literal and metaphorical inmost cave
    weaknesses:
    - Word count exceeds limit by 185 words (significant structural issue)
    - Killer's identity reveal could use more foreshadowing
    - "Marcus Chen's role feels slightly underdeveloped\u2014he's present but not\
      \ deeply characterized"
    - Could expand on the mechanics of how Dante channels the NA chip's power for
      clarity
