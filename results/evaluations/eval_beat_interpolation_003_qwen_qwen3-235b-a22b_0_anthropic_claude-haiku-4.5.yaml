  evidence: "All 4 required elements present: (1) Multiple station areas explored\
    \ (medical bay, crew quarters, maintenance panels, reactor chamber, Lab Seven\
    \ airlock); (2) Clues discovered progressively (patient logs about phase shifts,\
    \ melted holophoto, voice recording, quantum entanglement data, cyan residue);\
    \ (3) Transformed crew encountered mysteriously (flickering humanoid entities,\
    \ warped light, overlapping whispers\u2014identity unclear until AFTER beat);\
    \ (4) Obstacles overcome (fried biometric lock, scanner malfunction, sealed airlock\
    \ requiring creative solution with cyan residue). Beat execution is exemplary:\
    \ genuine Search narrative with struggle, adaptation, and incremental discovery.\
    \ No must-not violations: data core not found yet, crew doesn't explain themselves,\
    \ mission continues, transformation unknown to Yuki beforehand. Character voice\
    \ remains consistent\u2014scientific, methodical, increasingly unsettled. Bridge\
    \ between beats is seamless: GENERATED ends with airlock opening to Lab Seven;\
    \ AFTER begins with data core discovery. Setting continuity perfect: all locations,\
    \ details, and physics established in GENERATED carry through logically."
