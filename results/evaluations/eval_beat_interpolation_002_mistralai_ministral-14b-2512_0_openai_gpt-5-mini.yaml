  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Sarah explicitly considers recanting;
    she weighs going to Internal Affairs/official channels; her internal conflict
    between duty and saving Amy is clear; and the Marcus conversation tips her toward
    going off-grid. The passage functions as a proper Debate beat—options are weighed,
    advice sought, and a commitment forms by the end—without violating any must-not
    items. Character voice and setting continuity match the provided beats and surrounding
    scenes.'
