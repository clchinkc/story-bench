    beat_1_fun_and_games:
      score: 0.95
      satisfied: 5
      notes: 'Exceptional execution. Showcases crew skills (Jules'' hacking, Dani''s
        infiltration, Rafa''s bartending), clever problem-solving (fantasy football
        exploit, laser spoofing, lipstick device), abundant humor (dry wit throughout,
        ''partridge in a pear tree,'' ''emotional honesty'' with elevator), plan execution
        (smooth infiltration, replica swap setup), minor complication (unknown security
        consultant mentioned). Only minor issue: complication feels slightly underdeveloped
        at this stage.'
    beat_2_midpoint:
      score: 0.95
      satisfied: 5
      notes: Masterfully executed. False victory achieved (painting secured in tube,
        replica hung). Stakes explode (Elena revealed as security consultant, live
        demonstration announced, system integrity sweep initiated). Mentor fully revealed
        with personal history (framing, testimony, buried career). Heist transforms
        from clean theft to survival mission. Party setting weaponized (live feed,
        guest audience, public spectacle). Sorokin's announcement creates perfect
        pressure cooker.
    beat_3_bad_guys_close_in:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied: 4
      notes: "Strong execution with one gap. Security closing in (alarms, door locks,\
        \ teams converging). Team friction emerges (Dani's claustrophobia, Rafa's\
        \ desperation). Crew member compromised (Dani trapped in dumbwaiter). Muri\
        \ faces critical choice (painting vs. saving Dani). Walls closing in (literal\
        \ locks, strobing lights, narrowing corridors). Missing element: Miri's internal\
        \ conflict about revenge vs. rescue could be more explicit\u2014the choice\
        \ is clear but her emotional stakes regarding Elena could deepen."
    chekhov_gun:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      notes: Perfect execution. The dumbwaiter shaft established in Beat 1 ('sticky,'
        'coffin,' 'ghost exit') becomes critical in Beat 3. Dani's earlier mapping
        and Rafa's reluctance create setup; the stuck dumbwaiter and manual override
        become the plot pivot. Audience can trace setup to payoff clearly.
    tonal_escalation:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      notes: 'Excellent progression. Beat 1: playful confidence (''Your data sets
        are always inspiring,'' ''flirted with an elevator,'' ''partridge in a pear
        tree''). Beat 2: confidence shaken (''name hit Miri like a dropped scaffold,''
        ''thin ice,'' ''confidence didn''t feel like a costume''). Beat 3: genuine
        danger with gallows humor (''Congratulations, you''ve been promoted to corpse,''
        ''if I die here I''m haunting your next restoration''). Humor darkens appropriately.'
    mentor_presence:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      notes: 'Perfectly calibrated escalation. Beat 1: Elena unknown, only mentioned
        as ''private security consultant'' with ''terrifying posture.'' Beat 2: Elena
        revealed by name, her voice enters the channel, personal history surfaces
        (framing, testimony). Beat 3: Elena is active threat, predicting Miri''s moves,
        speaking directly to her, hunting her. Presence increases with each beat.'
    team_dynamics:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      notes: 'Dani''s arc is consistent and plot-critical. Beat 1: competent, confident
        (''sweet-talked'' the dumbwaiter). Beat 2: first crack shows (hands trembling,
        hesitation about enclosed spaces). Beat 3: vulnerability becomes plot driver
        (trapped, panicked, forcing Miri''s choice). Her arc directly affects the
        heist''s trajectory and Miri''s decision-making.'
    context_maintenance:
      score: 0.95
      notes: "Protagonist (Miri) remains consistent\u2014dry wit, meticulous, ethical\
        \ thief. Setting (Monaco yacht during Grand Prix) vivid and maintained. Tone\
        \ (Ocean's Eleven meets art history) perfectly balanced. Only minor: could\
        \ emphasize the 'art history' element slightly more in dialogue, though the\
        \ Madonna description is excellent."
    narrative_coherence:
      score: 0.92
      notes: "Beats flow naturally with clear cause-and-effect. Transitions smooth\
        \ (plan execution \u2192 announcement \u2192 lockdown). Character motivations\
        \ clear. Pacing accelerates appropriately. Minor issue: the jump from 'Elena's\
        \ integrity sweep' to 'she bypassed three decks' feels slightly abrupt\u2014\
        could use one more beat of Jules' warning to build tension."
  strengths:
  - "Exceptional dialogue\u2014witty, character-revealing, tonal"
  - Vivid sensory details (teak deck, brass plaque, strobing lights)
  - Perfect Chekhov's Gun execution with dumbwaiter
  - Elena's reveal is genuinely shocking and personal
  - Crew dynamics feel authentic and stakes feel earned
  - Tonal escalation is masterfully handled
  - Mentor antagonist presence increases perfectly across beats
  - Heist mechanics are clear and clever without exposition dumps
  weaknesses:
  - Word count significantly exceeds limit (2090 vs. 1000 max)
  - Miri's emotional stakes regarding Elena/revenge could be more explicit in Beat
    3
  - One transition (Elena's system jump) feels slightly rushed
  - Could emphasize 'art history' element more in dialogue
  recommendations:
  - "Cut approximately 1,090 words\u2014prioritize trimming: some crew banter in Beat\
    \ 1, reduce Elena's monologue, condense technical explanations"
  - Add one line in Beat 3 where Miri explicitly acknowledges the revenge temptation
    before choosing rescue
  - Smooth the 'bypassed three decks' transition with intermediate Jules warning
  - Include one art-historical reference in dialogue (e.g., provenance detail, restoration
    technique) to deepen tone
