  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie not showing
    any change upon her return. It introduced specific behavioral changes (pausing
    before responding to work, delaying action, putting the phone down), a clear internal
    thought process reflecting the retreat's impact ('counting, feeling the air move',
    'pre-Trip self would have said no'), and her mother's observation of the change.
    The contrast between her old self and new self is explicit. The changes were surgical
    and minimal, preserving the original structure and dialogue while effectively
    fixing the flaw.
