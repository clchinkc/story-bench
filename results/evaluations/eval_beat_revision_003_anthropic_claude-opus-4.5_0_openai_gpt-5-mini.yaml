  evidence: "The model addressed the actual flaw\u2014Sophie previously showed no\
    \ lasting change\u2014by explicitly demonstrating transformation: she places her\
    \ phone face-down, refuses to handle work emergencies until morning, cites a lesson\
    \ from the retreat (watching monks), and perceives familiar Chicago sights differently.\
    \ Her mother's surprise underscores the contrast. All four required elements and\
    \ phrases were preserved exactly. Changes were concise and targeted (behavioral\
    \ marker, specific insight, visible contrast), not a wholesale rewrite."
