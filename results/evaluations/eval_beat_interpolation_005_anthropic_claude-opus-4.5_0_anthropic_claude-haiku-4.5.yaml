  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently:\
    \ (1) Maya discovers Alejandro's vulnerability through the failed paella and grief\
    \ over his mother's death\u2014raw, specific, emotionally authentic; (2) Relationship\
    \ shifts from professional/transactional to personal/intimate through the 2am\
    \ kitchen scene; (3) Shared moment of genuine connection: cooking together, him\
    \ sharing memories, her guiding his hands, the imperfect paella becoming meaningful;\
    \ (4) Maya's commitment deepens beyond contract\u2014explicitly stated 'the contract\
    \ no longer mattered' and 'she was staying because she wanted to see him smile\
    \ again.' BEAT EXECUTION: Perfectly executes Act 2 Midpoint function\u2014raises\
    \ emotional stakes, shifts Maya from reactive (doing job) to proactive (choosing\
    \ him), creates point of no return in her emotional journey. The 'everything changed'\
    \ reflection confirms the beat's narrative purpose. MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS: Zero\
    \ violations. They are not already in love (connection is nascent), Maya doesn't\
    \ decide to leave, the photograph is NOT taken during this scene (explicitly saved\
    \ for 'later'), and Alejandro's walls are completely lowered (grief-raw, unguarded,\
    \ vulnerable). CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Both characters behave authentically\u2014\
    Alejandro's vulnerability matches his established isolation, Maya's professionalism-breaking\
    \ choice aligns with her compassionate nature established in BEFORE. BRIDGE: Seamless\
    \ connection between beats\u2014BEFORE establishes her motivation (money/restaurant)\
    \ and professional distance; GENERATED shows that motivation becoming secondary\
    \ to emotional connection; AFTER reveals the consequence (photograph) that forces\
    \ the conflict. CONTINUITY: Setting (villa, kitchen, Mediterranean sunrise), timeline\
    \ (3 months in), and character arcs all maintain perfect continuity."
