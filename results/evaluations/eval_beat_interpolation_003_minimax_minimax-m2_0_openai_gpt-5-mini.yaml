  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas
    (quarters, mess, corridors, lab), discovers medical logs indicating dimensional
    phase-locking, encounters translucent transformed crew, and overcomes obstacles
    (locked bulkhead, rerouting power, finding Reyes'' shutdown code). Deduction:
    one must-not was violated — the Search section ends with Yuki finding the data
    core (prematurely moving into the ''Find'' beat), so must_not_score is reduced
    to 0.75 (1 of 4 must-not items violated). Word count is invalid (538, outside
    250–400). Character behavior and setting continuity are consistent. The passage
    executes the Search beat well (trials, adaptation, progress) but bleeds into the
    next beat, so execution and bridge scores are slightly reduced.'
