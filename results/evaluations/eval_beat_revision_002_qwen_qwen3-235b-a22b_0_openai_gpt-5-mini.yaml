  evidence: 'The model addressed the All Is Lost problem: it made the fundraiser impossible
    (still two months short), the grant explicitly rejected (final denial), stripped
    Marcus of support (Denise is revealed to have been job-hunting and then leaves
    after a confrontation), and added a ''whiff of death'' (the loss of his son and
    the empty center). These changes correctly target the original flaw and create
    a genuine rock-bottom moment. The revision preserves all four required elements/phrases
    exactly, but is more than a surgical edit—expanding scenes and adding emotional/betrayal
    detail—hence a moderate minimal_change score.'
