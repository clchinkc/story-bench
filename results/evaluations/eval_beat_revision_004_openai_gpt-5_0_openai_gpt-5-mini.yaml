  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw (info-dump/telling rather than showing)
    by converting summary into a lived scene: Rachel demonstrates detective instincts
    (tracing the printout, noting the mismatched shadow), the apartment and precinct
    are rendered with sensory detail (jazz on the radio, lukewarm coffee, fluorescents
    buzzing), and her partnership with Detective James Oyelaran is shown through natural
    dialogue and shared actions (handing coffee, trading jabs, pointing at the board).
    Her devotion to work and cold cases is implied via the ''Cold—Photocopies'' box,
    the crime board, and the drawer she keeps opening. The required phrases (''Detective
    Rachel Torres'', ''Detective James Oyelaran'', ''cat named Sherlock'', ''Tuesday
    morning in October'') are all preserved exactly; however, an explicit reference
    to ''Queens apartment'' was not retained, so 4 of 5 preservation elements remain.
    The revision is high-quality prose with no notable errors, but it is more than
    a surgical edit—effectively a scene rewrite—so the minimal_change_score reflects
    a moderate rather than minimal change.'
