  evidence: The word count is significantly over the requested range, which is a minor
    issue. Character voice is mostly consistent, but Alejandro's quick shift from
    'difficult man' to sharing deep trauma and accepting comfort feels a little fast,
    though the storm and shared meal help to justify it. The bridge is good, but the
    'Point of No Return' from Act 1 felt a bit more about Maya's financial desperation,
    and this Midpoint shifts the focus heavily to Alejandro's emotional state, which
    is a good development but the connection to the initial 'Point of No Return' could
    be slightly stronger.
