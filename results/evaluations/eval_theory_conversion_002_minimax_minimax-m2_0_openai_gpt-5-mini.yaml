  evidence: 'All 12 Campbell beats appear and occur in proper sequence (Ordinary World
    through Return with Elixir). All 7 required elements are preserved: Maya protagonist,
    pottery as central skill, grandmother''s legacy (journal), mountain shrine journey,
    dried spring problem, theme of surrendering control, and Maya''s transformation.
    The only notable issue is word count: the converted text is 922 words, outside
    the requested 600–800 range. Minor stylistic note: the ''mentor'' is a journal
    rather than a living mentor, but it effectively fulfills the role.'
