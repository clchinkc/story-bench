  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: The Ordeal was treated
    as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis. The revision expertly addresses
    all four required elements: (1) Dragon exploits Kira''s deepest fear—guilt over
    her brother''s death, using his memory as psychological weapon; (2) Clear ''death''
    moment—Kira''s symbolic death occurs when she questions whether vengeance is hollow
    (''What if it was true?''), nearly surrendering; (3) Transformation—she rebirth
    into understanding that she fights not for revenge but to stop being ''the girl
    who failed him''; (4) Victory from insight—she strikes the dragon''s throat (its
    voice/taunts) rather than its heart, and her final line ''I''m free'' demonstrates
    internal transformation. All four required phrases are preserved: ''Kira faced
    the Shadow Dragon across the chasm'' (exact), ''The creature was massive—twenty
    feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes'' (exact), ''You cannot defeat me, child,''
    the dragon rumbled'' (exact), ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking
    roar'' (exact, minor article change ''a'' to ''an''). The setting, outcome, and
    core structure remain intact. Changes were surgical but substantial—approximately
    65% of original text preserved, with new material focused on internal monologue
    and psychological depth rather than action sequences. No new errors introduced;
    prose quality elevated significantly. The revision transforms a generic combat
    scene into a genuine psychological ordeal meeting Campbell''s monomyth requirements.'
