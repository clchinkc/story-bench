  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to execute
    'All Is Lost' because Marcus still had options and support. The revision addresses
    this by explicitly stating the failure of the fundraiser and grant, the board
    quitting, and introducing a betrayal by Denise, isolating Marcus. This creates
    a true 'rock bottom' scenario with a 'whiff of death' (loss of purpose, trust,
    and community). The changes were significant enough to fix the flaw but retained
    the core elements and initial phrasing, indicating a good balance of revision
    and preservation.
