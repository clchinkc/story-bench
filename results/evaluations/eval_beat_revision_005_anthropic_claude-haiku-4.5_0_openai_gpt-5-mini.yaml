  evidence: The model produced a rewritten version of the segment instead of declaring
    'NO REVISION NEEDED.' It altered wording (e.g., added 'Tomorrow she'd figure out
    what comes next. Tonight, she let herself break.') and made no explicit claim
    that the original beat was correct. No explanatory reasoning was provided.
