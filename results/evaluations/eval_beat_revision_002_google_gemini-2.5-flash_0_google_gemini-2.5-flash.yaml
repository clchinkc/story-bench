  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true 'All Is Lost' moment. It addressed the flaw by eliminating Marcus's options
    (fundraiser failed, grant rejected), isolating him (Denise leaves), and showing
    him genuinely giving up hope. The 'whiff of death' is present in the metaphorical
    loss of his life's work and purpose. The changes were surgical and effective,
    preserving the core elements while transforming the emotional impact. All required
    phrases and preserved elements are present.
