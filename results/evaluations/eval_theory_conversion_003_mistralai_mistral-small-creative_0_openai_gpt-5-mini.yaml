  evidence: 'All four three-act beats are clearly present: Act 1 sets up Kenji''s
    ordinary world and inciting incident (the letter) and his decision to go to Kyoto
    (first plot point); Act 2A contains rising action and a clear midpoint (festival
    realization); Act 2B escalates with the investor temptation and the fallout (complications
    leading to the second plot point); Act 3 resolves with Kenji''s rejection of the
    deal, apology, and quiet rebuilding. All eight required elements are preserved
    exactly. Minor deduction on structural_accuracy_score because the climax is rendered
    as a quiet, internal turning point (deleting the offer and apology at the shrine)
    rather than a single, sharply staged external confrontation — it slightly diffuses
    the Act 3 peak though this choice fits the story''s quiet aesthetic.'
