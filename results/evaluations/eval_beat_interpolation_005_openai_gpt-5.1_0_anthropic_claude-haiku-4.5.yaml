  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently:
    (1) Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability—the hand tremor, his fear of public
    perception, his isolation rooted in trauma; (2) Relationship shifts from professional
    to personal—moves from rejected plates to intimate kitchen conversation; (3) Shared
    moment creates genuine connection—the cocido scene with softened defenses, physical
    proximity, emotional honesty; (4) Maya commits beyond contract—she actively chooses
    to help (''we adapt''), moves from transactional to relational motivation. The
    beat perfectly executes the narrative function: Alejandro lowers his walls, Maya
    shifts from reactive (cooking what''s on menu) to proactive (cooking what heals),
    and both characters cross an emotional point of no return. All must-not items
    avoided: they''re not in love yet (connection is genuine but nascent), Maya doesn''t
    leave or breach contract, photo isn''t taken during scene, Alejandro does lower
    his walls. Character voices remain consistent—Maya''s directness, Alejandro''s
    guarded-then-vulnerable arc. Bridge is seamless: BEFORE shows contract signing/stakes;
    GENERATED shows the emotional breakthrough that makes those stakes personal; AFTER
    shows the external consequence that tests that commitment. Setting continuity
    perfect: kitchen established, staff sent home, intimate space maintained. DEDUCTION:
    Word count exceeds range by 136 words (586 vs 300-450 max), which is a technical
    requirement violation but doesn''t affect narrative quality.'
