  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Marcus
    introduced as mentor with clear credentials (former cartographer, thief, rune-reader);
    (2) Practical wisdom provided (''forest tests intentions, not abilities'') and
    tangible tools (compass, satchel, supplies, parchment map); (3) Elena''s doubt
    shifts convincingly from ''I can''t do this'' to ''wrong''s better than never
    trying'' - reluctant acceptance achieved; (4) Librarian skills reframed as asset
    (''you know how to find things''). All 4 must-not items avoided: Elena remains
    doubtful/hesitant (not confident/eager), Marcus explicitly does not accompany
    her, setting is The Curious Compass shop (not forest), no magical powers discovered.
    Character voice consistent throughout - Elena''s internal conflict and librarian
    perspective maintained. Bridge between beats seamless: BEFORE ends with refusal
    and walking away; GENERATED shows her returning to seek guidance; AFTER shows
    her at forest threshold ready to cross. Continuity perfect: Marcus''s gifts (compass,
    satchel, supplies) referenced in AFTER; mentor''s wisdom echoed in Elena''s thoughts.
    DEDUCTION: Word count (495) exceeds requirement (200-350) by 41%, which is significant
    but does not affect narrative quality or beat execution. This is a technical violation
    only.'
  overall_assessment: Exceptional execution of the Meeting the Mentor beat. The generated
    content masterfully introduces Marcus as a credible, mysterious mentor figure
    who provides both practical tools and psychological reframing. Elena's character
    arc within this beat is particularly strong—her doubt doesn't vanish but transforms
    into cautious willingness. The dialogue feels natural and reveals character through
    interaction. The only issue is word count excess, which appears to reflect the
    writer's commitment to rich detail rather than carelessness. This would score
    1.0 for narrative quality despite the technical word count violation.
