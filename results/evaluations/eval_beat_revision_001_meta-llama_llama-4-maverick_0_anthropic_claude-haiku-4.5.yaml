  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: The Ordeal was executed\
    \ as a mere difficult fight rather than a transformative crisis involving confrontation\
    \ with internal fear. The revision successfully addresses all four actual flaw\
    \ components: (1) The dragon now explicitly exploits Kira's deepest fear\u2014\
    guilt over her brother's death\u2014with targeted dialogue ('Your brother's fate\
    \ awaits you. You failed him once'); (2) A clear 'death' moment is introduced\
    \ where Kira falls to her knees, her vision blurs, and 'her world go[es] dark,'\
    \ representing psychological/symbolic death; (3) Transformation occurs through\
    \ the darkness moment where 'something shifted' and she recalls her brother's\
    \ determination, emerging with 'newfound ferocity'; (4) Victory now stems from\
    \ this internal rebirth and new understanding rather than mere persistence. All\
    \ four required phrases are preserved exactly or near-exactly: 'Kira faced the\
    \ Shadow Dragon across the chasm,' 'The creature was massive\u2014twenty feet\
    \ of obsidian scales and burning eyes,' the dragon's dialogue, and 'The Shadow\
    \ Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar.' The changes were surgical rather\
    \ than wholesale\u2014the model inserted psychological depth into existing battle\
    \ structure, added the guilt-exploitation dialogue, and wove in the symbolic death/rebirth\
    \ sequence without dismantling the original framework. Minor weakness: The transformation\
    \ could be slightly more explicit in showing how Kira's approach fundamentally\
    \ changes post-rebirth (the 'newfound ferocity' is stated but could be shown more\
    \ vividly). The phrase 'a earth-shaking roar' contains a minor grammatical error\
    \ (should be 'an') but this was preserved from the original, so not a new error.\
    \ Overall, this is a strong, minimally-invasive fix that correctly identifies\
    \ and resolves the actual structural flaw."
