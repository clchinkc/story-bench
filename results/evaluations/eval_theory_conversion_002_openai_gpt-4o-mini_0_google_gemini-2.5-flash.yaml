  evidence: The 'Meeting the Mentor' beat is not explicitly present. While the grandmother's
    journal acts as a mentor, there isn't a direct 'meeting' with a living mentor
    figure. The tone is mostly maintained, but some sentences feel a bit overly descriptive
    or slightly break the 'quiet' aspect. Structural accuracy is good, but the 'Refusal
    of the Call' and 'Crossing the Threshold' feel a bit blended and less distinct
    than they could be.
