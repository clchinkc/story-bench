  evidence: 'All 12 Campbell beats are represented: Ordinary World (village life),
    Call to Adventure (dry spring, dreams), Refusal (hesitation, ''I am not my grandmother''),
    Meeting the Mentor (spiritual memory from elders and later grandmother''s journal),
    Crossing the Threshold (leaving village/climb), Tests/Allies/Enemies (ascent trials—no
    explicit allies/enemies but tests are present), Approach to Inmost Cave (ruined
    shrine), Ordeal (internal surrender during making), Reward (unique vessel), Road
    Back (difficult descent, temptation to abandon), Resurrection (final ceremony
    at spring), Return with Elixir (village restored, Maya transformed). All seven
    required elements are preserved. Deductions: minor structural accuracy reduction
    because the ''Meeting the Mentor'' is portrayed more as a memory/late journal
    discovery rather than a clear pre-threshold mentor figure, and the Tests/Allies/Enemies
    beat lacks explicit allies or antagonists (only personal trials). Tone is well
    maintained (quiet, meditative, transformative). Word count is outside the required
    600–800 range (converted text is 857 words), so word_count_valid is false.'
