  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats appear: Exposition (Samira, her world, expertise),
    Rising Action (quarantine, mounting cases, evolving pathogen), Climax (Nexus confrontation
    and Samira’s decision to release data), Falling Action (immediate aftermath—cure
    distribution, epidemic curve bending), Denouement (career fallout and new equilibrium).
    All six core elements are present (Samira, engineered virus, Raj, Nexus, public
    release of cure, Samira’s sacrifice). Structural accuracy docked slightly (0.9)
    because the narrative compresses the Nexus meeting and the public release so the
    line between climax and falling action is a bit blurred. Word count is invalid:
    the converted piece is ~1065 words, outside the required 500–700 range.'
