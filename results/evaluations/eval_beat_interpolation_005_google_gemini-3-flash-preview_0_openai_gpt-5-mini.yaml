  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Alejandro reveals vulnerability
    (loss and silence), the relationship shifts from professional to personal (distance
    evaporates; shared spoon), there is a clear shared moment creating genuine connection
    (custard, spoon, tactile detail), and Maya explicitly chooses to stay emotionally
    beyond the contract. None of the forbidden items occur (no pre-existing love,
    no contract breach/decision to leave, no photo in this scene, Alejandro opens
    up rather than remaining closed). Character behavior and setting remain consistent
    with the setup, so no deductions were necessary.'
