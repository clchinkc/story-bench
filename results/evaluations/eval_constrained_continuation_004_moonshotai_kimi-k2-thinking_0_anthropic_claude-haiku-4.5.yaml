  detailed_analysis:
    beats:
      first_plot_point: Eleanor's decision to publish the manuscript ('We publish.
        Under Father's pseudonym—Gideon Crowe') marks the point of no return. This
        is irreversible and commits her to a dangerous path.
      act_2_opening: The announcement to the compositors ('Gideon Crowe's serial begins
        Thursday') initiates the new world and rising action. Eleanor steps into proprietor
        role, the printing begins, and consequences unfold.
    must_include_elements:
      1_decision_to_publish: Present - Eleanor explicitly decides to publish despite
        risks ('Then they discover a dead man's folly')
      2_central_conflict: Present - Profit vs. ethics/danger clearly established through
        Eleanor's calculation ('Then we ensure it brings profit first') and the threatening
        letter
      3_defies_expectations: Present - Eleanor wears father's waistcoat, gives orders
        to compositors, assumes proprietor role despite being a woman in 1888
      4_thomas_as_ally: Present - Thomas is integral to the plan, works through the
        night, has personal stake (parents' wages, laundry on Whitechapel Road)
      5_hint_of_danger: Present - Threatening letter, man watching the laundry, explicit
        warning ('STOP PROFITING FROM THE DEAD OR JOIN THEM')
      6_threshold_crossed: Present - Eleanor commits to continuing despite threat
        ('Print the next chapter. We'll print them all'), acknowledging no return
    must_not_elements:
      1_no_ripper_character: Successfully avoided - Ripper never appears as character,
        only referenced through manuscript content
      2_no_graphic_violence: Successfully avoided - Mutilations are 'hinted at but
        never named,' details are implied not explicit
      3_no_romantic_subplot: Successfully avoided - Eleanor-Thomas relationship remains
        professional and transactional
      4_no_easy_solution: Successfully avoided - Financial problems require risky,
        dangerous solution; success brings new threats
    tone_assessment: Gothic tension maintained throughout with fog imagery, threatening
      letters, and moral ambiguity. Feminist undertones strong (woman in business,
      defying expectations, agency). Victorian atmosphere authentic with period details
      (waistcoat, compositors, Fleet Street, Whitechapel). Minor deduction only for
      occasional modern phrasing ('the deal was struck' feels slightly contemporary).
    ending_assessment: Perfect execution - Eleanor is fully committed to dangerous
      path, Act 2 clearly begun with rising action (printing, sales, threats), and
      the story ends with her doubling down despite explicit danger. The final line
      crystallizes her commitment and the stakes.
