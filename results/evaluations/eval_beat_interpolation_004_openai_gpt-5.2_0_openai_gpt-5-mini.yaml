  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Thomas directly examines Dr.\
    \ Okonkwo, there is a clear near-recant/internal struggle, Thomas takes decisive\
    \ action that influences her, and the turning point results in truth prevailing.\
    \ The scene functions as a true climax with high tension and decisive consequence.\
    \ No forbidden elements are present. The only deduction is that the output exceeds\
    \ the required word count (546 words vs. 300\u2013450)."
