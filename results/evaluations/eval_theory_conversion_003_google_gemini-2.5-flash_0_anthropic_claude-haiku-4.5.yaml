  evidence: 'Conversion excellently maps Save the Cat beats to three-act structure.
    Act 1 (Setup): Opening Image + Theme Stated + Set-Up + Catalyst establish Kenji''s
    hollow corporate life and Yuki''s wedding invitation as inciting incident. Act
    2A (Rising Action, First Half): Debate + Break into Two + B Story + Fun and Games
    show Kenji''s journey to Kyoto, meeting Haruki, initial connection with Yuki,
    and false sense of progress at midpoint. Act 2B (Rising Action, Second Half):
    Bad Guys Close In + All Is Lost + Dark Night of the Soul depict business rivals''
    temptation, Yuki''s rejection, and his nadir of despair. Act 3 (Resolution): Break
    into Three + Finale + Final Image show his refusal of the deal, unconditional
    apology, attending wedding from afar, and opening the bamboo shop. All 8 core
    elements preserved: Kenji (protagonist), lost corporate career, estranged Yuki,
    Kyoto wedding, Haruki the craftsman, business temptation, theme of people over
    ambition, bamboo shop ending. Tone is consistently quiet, contemplative, with
    Japanese aesthetic (mist-shrouded mountains, bamboo weaving, village festivals).
    Minor deduction (0.05) for structural_accuracy: the transition between Act 2A
    and 2B could be slightly sharper in demarcating the midpoint. Minor deduction
    (0.05) for tone: one phrase (''knife twist'') slightly more dramatic than the
    restrained aesthetic elsewhere.'
