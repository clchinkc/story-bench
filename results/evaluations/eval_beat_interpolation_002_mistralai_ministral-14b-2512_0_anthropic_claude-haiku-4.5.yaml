  evidence: 'ELEMENTS FOUND: (1) Recanting testimony considered as easy option (''she
    could still call the number, agree to recant''), (2) Going to authorities explored
    (''go to Internal Affairs, blow the whistle''), (3) Internal conflict present
    throughout (''Easy. Coward''s way'' vs. duty to Amy). MISSING: (4) A clear moment/conversation
    that tips her toward the third option (going rogue). Marcus suggests press/DA/leaks,
    but Sarah dismisses these—the tipping point toward vigilantism is implied rather
    than dramatized. VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah explicitly decides to ''become...a ghost''
    and go ''off-grid'' during the Debate beat itself, which skips the debate and
    commits to action prematurely. (2) The AFTER section reveals she has already resigned
    and is surveilling the Marchetti compound, meaning the decision to go rogue was
    already made before this beat ends—this violates the narrative function of Debate
    as the decision point. The beat should end with commitment, not with her already
    acting on it. CHARACTER: Strong voice, consistent emotional stakes, believable
    internal logic. BRIDGE: Good connection between BEFORE''s inciting incident and
    GENERATED''s wrestling, though the AFTER section undermines the beat''s purpose.
    CONTINUITY: Apartment setting maintained, timeline (72 hours) consistent, character
    relationships intact.'
