  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Recanting
    option explicitly considered with consequences mapped (''Amy dies anyway because
    living witnesses are liabilities''). (2) Official channels thoroughly debated
    through Marcus conversation, with specific leak vulnerabilities identified (Garcia
    raid, compartmentalization failures). (3) Internal conflict powerfully rendered
    through visceral language (''lands like a brick in her gut'') and duty vs. sister
    tension. (4) Third option emerges organically from clue-spotting (green paint)
    and Marcus''s failed reassurance. Beat function executed perfectly—Sarah wrestles
    with genuine alternatives, seeks counsel, and commits to action through internal
    reasoning rather than external force. Character voice is consistent, sharp, and
    detective-specific. Bridge to Break Into Two is seamless—resignation letter directly
    follows debate resolution. VIOLATION: Word count is 474, exceeding 400-word maximum
    by 74 words (18.5% over). This is a material constraint violation. MINOR ISSUE:
    One must-not item partially violated—Sarah''s decision to ''step where the badge
    can''t go'' foreshadows going rogue, though she hasn''t formally resigned yet
    during this beat. The AFTER section shows resignation, but the GENERATED section
    ends before that point, so violation is minimal (foreshadowing vs. action). Deducted
    0.25 from must_not_score for this anticipatory language.'
