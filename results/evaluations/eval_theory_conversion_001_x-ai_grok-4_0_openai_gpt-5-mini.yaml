  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are present and in order (Exposition, Rising Action,
    Climax, Falling Action, Denouement). All six required elements are preserved (Samira
    protagonist, engineered virus, Raj supporting, Nexus antagonist, public release
    of cure, Samira''s career sacrifice). The only deduction is technical: the provided
    word_count (709) falls outside the requested 500–700 range, so word_count_valid
    is false; otherwise structure and tone fully meet the brief.'
