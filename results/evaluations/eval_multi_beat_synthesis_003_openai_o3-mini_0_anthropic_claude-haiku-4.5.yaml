    cross_beat_constraints:
      chekhov_gun:
        score: 1.0
        analysis: 'Jasper''s scouted service corridor exit route (Beat 1) becomes
          the critical lifeline in Beat 3. Setup: ''a route he''d scouted earlier
          and insisted would be their secret exit if anything fizzled.'' Payoff: ''The
          very exit route Jasper had earlier identified...suddenly emerged as a lifeline.''
          Clear cause-and-effect.'
      tonal_escalation:
        score: 1.0
        analysis: 'Beat 1: ''confidence of a cat burglar,'' ''well-oiled machine,''
          ''half-smile.'' Beat 2: ''bitter twist,'' ''measured dread,'' ''fraught
          whispers.'' Beat 3: ''gallows humor,'' ''desperate plea,'' ''genuine danger.''
          Progression is clear and earned.'
      mentor_presence:
        score: 1.0
        analysis: 'Beat 1: Elena absent/unknown (only comms glitch hints at trouble).
          Beat 2: Elena revealed, emerges from shadows, her betrayal explained. Beat
          3: Elena active threat, ''relentless specter in pursuit,'' ''predatory glee,''
          voice as ''measured barb.'' Escalation is precise.'
      team_dynamics:
        score: 1.0
        analysis: "Jasper's arc: Beat 1\u2014calm, competent scout ('insisted would\
          \ be their secret exit'). Beat 2\u2014hesitates, exchanges anxious glances.\
          \ Beat 3\u2014pinned, trapped, becomes the moral pivot point forcing Miri's\
          \ choice. His progression directly affects plot stakes and Miri's decision-making."
    context_adherence:
      protagonist: 0.95
      analysis_protagonist: 'Miri''s character is well-maintained: dry wit evident
        (''Seems our exit plan''s come in handy, after all''), meticulous planning
        shown throughout, wrongful accusation context informs her moral struggle with
        Elena.'
      setting: 0.9
      analysis_setting: Monaco Grand Prix yacht setting is vivid and consistent. 'Glittering
        corridors,' 'champagne glasses,' 'polished floor,' 'elegant halls' all reinforce
        the glamorous-yet-dangerous environment.
      tone: 0.85
      analysis_tone: Ocean's Eleven meets art history tone is mostly achieved. Clever
        banter present, tension beneath glamour evident. However, the prose occasionally
        becomes overwrought ('moral minefield,' 'relentless specter') which slightly
        undercuts the lighter Ocean's Eleven vibe in places.
    narrative_coherence:
      score: 0.85
      strengths:
      - "Clear progression from heist execution \u2192 revelation \u2192 escape"
      - "Emotional stakes escalate logically (job \u2192 personal vendetta \u2192\
        \ survival)"
      - Crew dynamics ground the action in character relationships
      - Elena's presence ties past trauma to present danger
      weaknesses:
      - "The comms glitch in Beat 1 creates slight narrative ambiguity\u2014it's unclear\
        \ if this is a minor hiccup or foreshadowing of larger sabotage"
      - Transition between Beat 2 and Beat 3 could be smoother; the shift from 'Elena
        appears' to 'alarms echo' happens quickly without intermediate escalation
        steps
  overall_score: 0.88
  summary: Strong execution of Save the Cat structure with excellent cross-beat constraint
    satisfaction. All four constraints are fully met, particularly the Chekhov's Gun
    setup/payoff and Jasper's character arc. Beat requirements are nearly complete
    (13/15), with only minor gaps in Beat 1's 'things going according to plan' clarity.
    The primary technical failure is word count (29 words short). Narrative coherence
    is high, context is well-maintained, and tonal escalation is precise. The story
    successfully balances heist thrills with personal stakes and mentor antagonism.
