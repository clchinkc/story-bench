  failed_items:
  - Beat 1 - Internal shift is present but somewhat implicit; the transition from
    'servant-scholar to active resistance' could be more explicitly marked as a psychological
    turning point rather than gradual realization
  detailed_analysis:
    beat_1_crossing_threshold:
      leaves_cape_coast: true
      point_of_no_return: true
      immediate_danger: true
      uses_wits_not_force: true
      internal_shift: Mostly present - final paragraph captures it ('no longer Amara
        the servant'), but the shift feels more like a conclusion than a moment experienced
        during Beat 1
      score: 0.9
    beat_2_tests_allies_enemies:
      uncertain_ally: Elderly woman and Kofi - excellent trust-testing sequence
      commitment_test: Password exchange and willingness to share dangerous intelligence
      enemy_obstacle: British patrol forces adaptation
      language_crucial: German with lieutenant, Twi/Fante with woman - masterfully
        deployed
      learns_about_resistance: Father's role as coordinator, network structure, scope
        of operation
      score: 1.0
    beat_3_approach_inmost_cave:
      nearing_stronghold: true
      moment_of_preparation: Implicit in forest journey and Kofi's explanations
      recognition_of_cost: Realization 'there was no safety anymore. Only the work.'
      final_obstacle: English patrol at camp approach - perfectly placed
      thematic_resistance_vs_survival: Amara chooses resistance (stepping forward,
        using German) over survival (hiding)
      score: 0.95
    chekhov_gun:
      skill_in_beat_1: German language demonstrated with second guard at checkpoint
      essential_in_beat_3: German used to distract lieutenant, enabling camp escape
      execution: Seamless and organic - the skill introduced early becomes the crucial
        tool
      score: 1.0
    identity_transformation:
      beat_1_servant_cautious: Drops eyes, makes herself small, 'careful persona she'd
        constructed'
      beat_2_realizes_capability: '''You read their documents?'' Kofi''s respect visible.
        ''I do more than read them.'''
      beat_3_claims_role: 'Final paragraph: ''no longer Amara the servant...Amara
        the fighter'''
      tracking: Clear progression, though Beat 1 to Beat 2 transition could be sharper
      score: 0.95
    escalating_danger:
      beat_1_threat_of_discovery: Guard questions her, military maps visible, three-day
        execution timeline
      beat_2_direct_confrontation: Patrol stops at stream, examines footprints, rifles
        cocked
      beat_3_active_pursuit: Patrol found camp approach, lieutenant interrogating
        Amara directly
      escalation: Excellent progression from potential to kinetic threat
      score: 1.0
    thematic_thread_knowledge_as_resistance:
      beat_1: Literacy and languages allow her to pass checkpoint; 'weaponizing every
        word'
      beat_2: Reading documents, password knowledge, language testing, understanding
        patrol schedules
      beat_3: German becomes shield; knowledge of military routes enables distraction;
        literacy as liberation tool
      consistency: Pervasive and well-integrated throughout
      score: 1.0
    context_maintenance:
      protagonist_amara: Fully realized - 24, scholar's daughter, multilingual, intelligence
        gatherer
      setting_cape_coast_to_ashanti: Vivid progression from colonial harbor through
        coastal scrub to forest highlands
      tone_historical_adventure: Period-appropriate details (red coats, wax seals,
        adinkra symbols, German colonial presence)
      anti_colonial_themes: Resistance network, Yaa Asantewaa reference, knowledge
        as weapon against colonizers
      survival_and_resistance: Central to every decision and obstacle
      dignity_in_defiance: Amara's choices reflect agency and courage, not victimhood
      score: 0.95
    narrative_coherence:
      beat_flow: Smooth progression with clear cause-and-effect
      pacing: Well-balanced between action, dialogue, and internal reflection
      foreshadowing: Military maps → patrol schedule detail; German language → final
        distraction
      character_consistency: Amara's choices align with her established skills and
        values
      minor_issue: The transition from Beat 2 to Beat 3 could include more explicit
        preparation/steeling moment
      score: 0.92
  overall_assessment: Exceptional execution of the Hero's Journey framework applied
    to anti-colonial resistance. The story masterfully weaves all 15 beat requirements
    and satisfies all 4 cross-beat constraints. Amara's character arc is compelling
    and earned through specific, concrete actions. The thematic integration of 'knowledge
    as resistance' is sophisticated and organic. Language and cultural details ground
    the narrative authentically. The only minor weakness is that the internal psychological
    shift in Beat 1 could be more explicitly marked as a turning point rather than
    a retrospective realization. This is a professional-quality historical adventure
    that honors both Campbell's structure and the historical context.
