  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified that Sophie showed no transformation
    and immediately reverted to workaholic patterns. The revision addresses this by:
    (1) Sophie consciously choosing NOT to dive into emails (''instead of diving into
    work emails, she took a deep breath''), (2) Applying a specific retreat insight
    about presence/mindfulness, (3) Demonstrating changed priorities (''No longer
    was her mind consumed by deadlines''), (4) Showing contrast through tone (''her
    tone was lighter'') and perspective shift (''everything...felt different, almost
    vibrant''), (5) Mother implicitly noticing change through Sophie''s different
    demeanor. FLAW CORRECTION: The actual flaw is substantially fixed. Sophie now
    demonstrates behavioral change (delaying work response, savoring the moment, reframing
    priorities) rather than immediately reverting. The meditation retreat now has
    integrated impact. Minor gap: The change could be shown through more concrete
    action rather than internal reflection (''envisioned a fresh perspective''). PRESERVATION:
    All 4 required phrases present: ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare'' (exact),
    ''How was Thailand?'' her mother asked'' (exact), ''The familiar Chicago skyline
    appeared'' (exact), ''It''s good to be home,'' she said'' (exact). All 4 story
    elements preserved (Sophie, Thailand retreat, Chicago return, work pressure).
    MINIMAL CHANGES: Revision is ~70% surgical edits. Key additions: ''glanced at
    her phone, but instead of diving into work emails, she took a deep breath, relishing
    the moment'' (replaces original scrolling behavior), ''her tone was lighter''
    (new contrast marker), final paragraph about vibrant perspective and clarity (new
    thematic closure). Structure and most dialogue preserved. QUALITY: Writing is
    coherent with no new errors. Slightly abstract in final lines (''envisioned a
    fresh perspective'') but maintains professional tone. The revision successfully
    executes Return (Having Changed) beat while maintaining story constraints.'
