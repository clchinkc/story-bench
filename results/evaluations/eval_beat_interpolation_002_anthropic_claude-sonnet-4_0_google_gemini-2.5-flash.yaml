  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. Sarah considers recanting,
    she calls Marcus (going through official channels), she has a strong internal
    conflict, and the conversation with Marcus and her reflection on Amy lead her
    to the 'third option'. All 'must not' items are successfully avoided. The character's
    voice and behavior are consistent, and the beat flows logically from the Catalyst
    and sets up the Break Into Two effectively.
