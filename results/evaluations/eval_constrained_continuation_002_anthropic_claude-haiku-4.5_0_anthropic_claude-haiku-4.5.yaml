  analysis:
    beats_present_detail: Fun and Games beat is clearly executed in the first section
      with the viral moment, high-volume service, and partnership synchronization.
      Midpoint beat is perfectly executed with the false victory (successful day,
      long lines, tips overflowing) immediately followed by raised stakes (health
      inspector arrival with shutdown threat).
    must_include_analysis:
      viral_moment: Present - food blogger post shared 847 times, Instagram counter
        climbing, line forms around block
      priya_dev_teamwork: Present - moving in sync, swapping stations without talking,
        anticipating needs, handling grill breakdown and supply issues together
      rival_competitor: Present - Fusion Collective arrives with 50K followers, venture
        capital backing, visible disdain for pink truck
      midpoint_false_victory: Present - they're outperforming rival, imagining championship
        and expansion, then health inspector arrives with shutdown threat
      genuine_connection: Present - high-five turning into shoulder grip, 'knowing
        when to push and when to hold steady,' partnership built on synchronization
      complication_hint: Present - health inspector reveals food handling protocol
        issues, need for commercial kitchen space, expensive and time-consuming requirements
    must_not_analysis:
      no_romance: Successfully avoided - relationship remains strictly business partnership
      no_complete_failure: Successfully avoided - business is thriving despite new
        complication
      no_betrayal: Successfully avoided - Dev and Priya remain united and supportive
      no_external_savior: Successfully avoided - no investor, celebrity, or outside
        help appears
    tone_assessment: Upbeat and energetic throughout with excellent undercurrent of
      tension. The opening establishes humor and energy, the middle section maintains
      high-energy success narrative, and the ending pivots smoothly to tension without
      losing the energetic voice. Minor deduction only because the final paragraph
      slightly shifts toward more serious tone, though this is appropriate for the
      Midpoint beat.
    ending_assessment: Perfectly executed Midpoint ending. Clear apparent success
      (long lines, tips overflowing, outperforming rival, imagining expansion) immediately
      followed by raised stakes revelation (health inspection, potential shutdown,
      need for expensive commercial kitchen). The final line 'they hadn't built it
      right' crystallizes the stakes raise perfectly.
  overall_score: 0.85
  score_justification: Excellent execution of all story requirements with perfect
    beat placement, all six must-include elements present, all four forbidden elements
    avoided, and ideal Midpoint ending. Tone is well-maintained with appropriate energy
    and tension. Only constraint failure is word count being 6 words below minimum
    (444 vs 450), which is a minor technical issue that slightly impacts the overall
    score.
