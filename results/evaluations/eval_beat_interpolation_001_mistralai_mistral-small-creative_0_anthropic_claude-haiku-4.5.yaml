  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Marcus
    introduced with vivid characterization (salt-and-pepper beard, eye patch, astrolabe),
    (2) Practical wisdom delivered (''Fear''s useful. Means you''re paying attention'')
    and tangible tools provided (compass, tinderbox, satchel), (3) Elena''s doubt
    shifts to reluctant acceptance (''the weight didn''t feel like a burden. It felt
    like a choice''), (4) Librarian skills reframed as valuable (''pattern recognition...That''s
    half the battle''). All 4 must-not items avoided: Elena remains doubtful/hesitant,
    Marcus explicitly refuses to accompany her, setting is shop not forest, no magical
    powers discovered. Character voice consistent throughout—Elena''s skepticism and
    Marcus''s gruff wisdom maintain established tones. Bridge between beats seamless:
    BEFORE ends with Elena refusing and walking out; GENERATED shows her arriving
    at shop (feet carrying her despite resistance), creating natural progression;
    AFTER shows her at forest threshold with Marcus''s wisdom internalized. Continuity
    perfect: satchel, compass, and Marcus''s words all carry forward. ONLY ISSUE:
    Word count 382 exceeds 350-word maximum by 32 words (9% over), which is a technical
    violation but does not diminish narrative quality or beat execution.'
  overall_assessment: Exceptional execution of the Meeting the Mentor beat with only
    minor technical constraint violation
error: null
