  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas (quarters,
    medical bay, research wing, Lab Four), discovers clues (Chen''s notes, Reyes''s
    log), encounters transformed crew (shimmers), and overcomes a challenge (rerouting
    power to Lab Seven). The ''Search'' beat is perfectly executed, showing Yuki actively
    investigating and facing obstacles without immediate resolution. No ''must not''
    items were violated. Character and continuity are consistent, and the bridge between
    beats is seamless.'
