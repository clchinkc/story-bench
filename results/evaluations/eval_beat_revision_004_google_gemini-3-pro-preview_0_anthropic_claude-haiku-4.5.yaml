  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: the original segment was
    pure exposition-through-telling (info-dump style) lacking sensory grounding, action,
    and scene. The revision transforms this into SHOWN exposition through: (1) Sensory
    details (radiator hissing, stale toner smell, wet wool, steaming coffee), (2)
    Characteristic behavior revealing Rachel''s traits (ignoring cold, scanning bullpen,
    immediately pulling cold case file, taking coffee gratefully), (3) Dialogue-based
    relationship dynamics with James showing 3-year partnership ease and mutual understanding,
    (4) Setting established through action in a lived space (apartment → precinct
    navigation), (5) Cat naturally integrated into morning routine with specific detail
    (scar tissue from arson site). All 5 preserved elements present: Rachel Torres
    (protagonist), James Oyelaran (partner), Sherlock (cat), Queens apartment, October
    Tuesday. All 4 required phrases present verbatim or near-exact. Changes were surgical
    but substantial—converted ~200 words of summary into ~290 words of scene, replacing
    telling with showing. No new errors introduced; prose quality is professional
    with strong sensory language and natural dialogue. The phone ring at end creates
    narrative momentum toward inciting incident. Minor: could have shown Rachel''s
    12-year tenure through one more behavioral detail, but this is negligible. The
    revision fully executes Exposition beat requirements.'
