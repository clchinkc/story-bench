  failed_constraints:
  - 'Word count exceeds maximum: 746 words vs. 700-word limit (46 words over)'
  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'Approach to the Inmost Cave: Clearly marked (''The Approach begins now''),
      featuring the choice between two paths and Zara''s decision to draw off pursuers'
    - 'The Ordeal: Excellently executed with the Chamber of Whispers—both physical
      (blade trap) and psychological (mirror chamber confronting failure) elements'
    must_include_detail:
    - 'Choice between safety and helping: Zara sacrifices her safety by sprinting
      toward the archway to draw off the Scorpion Guild, allowing Tomás to escape'
    - 'Trap requiring thief skills: The blade archway test demands Zara''s agility
      and balance—skills honed from her slum background'
    - 'Tomás''s true motivation revealed: His sister disappeared in the Library; he''s
      been using Zara to find answers'
    - 'Fear of failure confronted: The mirror chamber forces Zara to face her deepest
      fear—not death, but failure and inability to save her mother'
    - 'Symbolic death/rebirth: The shattering mirrors and Zara''s emergence ''changed''
      represents psychological transformation and acceptance'
    - 'Zara changed by Ordeal: She emerges with scraped hands, torn clothes, and internal
      shift—understanding her own motivations and Tomás''s'
    must_not_detail:
    - 'Cure not found: ✓ Avoided—cure remains a future goal'
    - 'No romantic subplot: ✓ Avoided—relationship remains complex and morally ambiguous'
    - 'Tomás survives: ✓ Avoided—he lives and returns to help'
    - 'No supernatural abilities for Zara: ✓ Avoided—all her actions rely on learned
      thief skills and physical ability'
    tone_assessment: Tense and morally complex throughout. Desperate hope evident
      in Zara's determination to find the cure. Moments of doubt and betrayal add
      nuance. Minor deduction only for occasional slight melodrama in internal monologue
      ('crushing her chest'), but overall maintains sophisticated tension.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect execution: Zara has passed the Ordeal (symbolic and
      literal), emerged changed, but faces immediate new complication (walls shifting,
      mechanism engaging). Cliffhanger is organic and raises stakes for next beat.'
  overall_score: 0.88
  score_rationale: Exceptional execution of narrative requirements with all beats,
    inclusions, and exclusions met perfectly. Tone is sophisticated and tense. Ending
    is compelling. Single constraint failure is the word count overage of 46 words
    (6.6% over limit), which is a technical violation but not severe enough to undermine
    the otherwise outstanding quality. The story demonstrates mastery of Campbell's
    monomyth structure and character development.
