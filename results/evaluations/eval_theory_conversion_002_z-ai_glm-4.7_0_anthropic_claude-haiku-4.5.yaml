  evidence: 'All 12 Hero''s Journey beats are present and clearly articulated: (1)
    Ordinary World—coastal village potter in grandmother''s shadow; (2) Call to Adventure—sacred
    spring runs dry, elders declare need for masterwork; (3) Refusal of Call—Maya
    retreats to workshop, claims she''s ''a potter of utility, not spirit''; (4) Meeting
    the Mentor—grandmother''s journal discovered in ruins; (5) Crossing the Threshold—leaves
    coast for mountain shrine; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—climb as physical test, wind/gravity
    as enemies, internal struggle with ego; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave—reaching the
    ruins, preparing for the work; (8) Ordeal—night of clay work, battling ego and
    self-doubt in firelight; (9) Reward—vessel forms, ''shaped by wind and mountain'';
    (10) Road Back—difficult descent, temptation to abandon quest; (11) Resurrection—placing
    vessel at spring, surrendering outcome; (12) Return with Elixir—water returns,
    Maya returns as master who listens. All 7 core elements preserved: Maya (protagonist),
    pottery/ceramics (central), grandmother''s legacy (journal, shrine, comparison),
    mountain shrine (three-day journey), dried spring (catalyst and resolution), surrender
    theme (explicit throughout), transformation (from utility potter to master listener).
    Tone is consistently quiet, meditative, and transformative with lyrical language
    (''hands perpetually dusted,'' ''tremor ran through the ground''). Minor deduction
    (0.05) for structural accuracy: the Tests/Allies/Enemies beat could be more distinctly
    separated into individual components, though all elements are present. Minor tone
    deduction (0.05): one moment (''The panic was a tangible thing, thick in the humid
    air'') slightly elevates intensity beyond the meditative register, though overall
    tone remains strong.'
