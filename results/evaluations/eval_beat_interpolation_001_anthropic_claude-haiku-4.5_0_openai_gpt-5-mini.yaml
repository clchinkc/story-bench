  evidence: 'All four required elements are clearly present: Marcus is introduced
    by name; he provides practical tools (satchel, brass compass) and practical wisdom
    about intentions and observation; Elena''s resistance is loosened but she remains
    uncertain (reluctant acceptance); and her librarian skills are explicitly framed
    as useful. None of the prohibited items appear: Elena does not become immediately
    confident or eager, Marcus refuses to accompany her and does not solve her problems,
    she is not in/near the forest, and she does not discover magical powers. Character
    voices and setting continuity are consistent and the scene cleanly bridges the
    Refusal and Crossing beats.'
