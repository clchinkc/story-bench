  evidence: The story successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the three-act structure,
    hitting all the key points. All 8 core elements are preserved. The word count
    is too high. The structural accuracy is good, but the break between Act 2A and
    2B is a little soft, and the 'Second Plot Point' isn't as distinct as it could
    be, blending into the 'All Is Lost' moment. However, the overall flow and progression
    are strong. The tone is perfectly maintained, delivering a quiet, redemptive drama
    with a clear Japanese aesthetic.
