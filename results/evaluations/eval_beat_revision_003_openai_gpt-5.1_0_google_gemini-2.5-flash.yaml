  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie immediately
    returning to her old workaholic patterns without showing any change from her meditation
    retreat. It introduced a clear internal conflict and a new behavior (delaying
    checking emails, putting the phone away) directly linked to a lesson from the
    retreat ('Notice the urge. Breathe. Choose.'). Her mother's line 'That's new'
    explicitly highlights the change, and Sophie's internal monologue about 'a thin
    new space between urgency and action' demonstrates her new perspective. The changes
    were surgical, adding internal thought and dialogue to demonstrate the transformation,
    rather than rewriting large sections.
