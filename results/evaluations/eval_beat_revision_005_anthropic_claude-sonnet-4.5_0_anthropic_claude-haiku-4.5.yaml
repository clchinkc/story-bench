  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive
    reasoning. The model accurately recognized all five key requirements were satisfied:
    (1) follows major defeat (gallery closure), (2) protagonist isolated (dark apartment,
    unanswered calls), (3) genuine despair (tears, broken promises, self-blame), (4)
    no solutions presented (exhausted all options), and (5) whiff of death element
    (mother''s hospice memory, symbolic gallery death). The model demonstrated strong
    beat understanding by explaining WHY each requirement was met with specific textual
    evidence. The explanation was detailed and accurate, avoiding false positives
    by not suggesting unnecessary revisions. The model''s reasoning about the pacing
    allowing for ''proper wallowing without rushing to hope'' shows sophisticated
    understanding of the beat''s emotional function.'
