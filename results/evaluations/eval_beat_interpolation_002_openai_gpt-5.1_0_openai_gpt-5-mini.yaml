  evidence: 'All four required elements are present (considering recanting, official
    channels, duty vs. sister conflict, and a tipping conversation/decision). The
    beat effectively performs the Debate function, maintains character voice, and
    cleanly sets up the Break into Two. No prohibited items appear. The only issue:
    word count is 520, which exceeds the 250–400 range.'
