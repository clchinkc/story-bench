  evidence: "Model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed zero transformation\
    \ and immediately reverted to workaholic patterns, negating the entire journey.\
    \ The revision fixes this precisely by: (1) Sophie consciously choosing NOT to\
    \ respond to work emergencies immediately\u2014applying the monks' breathing technique,\
    \ (2) Explicitly demonstrating changed behavior (phone face-down, airplane mode),\
    \ (3) Mother noticing the change ('That's new'), (4) Sophie articulating her transformation\
    \ ('so am I'), (5) Metaphorical contrast showing she sees her world differently\
    \ ('surprising space between moments'), (6) Changed relationship with work/phone\
    \ as the marker. All 4 required phrases preserved exactly: 'Sophie's flight landed\
    \ at O'Hare', 'How was Thailand? her mother asked', 'The familiar Chicago skyline\
    \ appeared', 'It's good to be home, she said'. Changes were surgical\u2014the\
    \ original structure remains intact, with insertions of: breathing technique application,\
    \ phone-down action, mother's observation, and reflective internal monologue.\
    \ No elements removed. The revision fully executes the Return (Having Changed)\
    \ beat by showing integration of the journey's lessons into immediate real-world\
    \ choices. Minor deduction (0.05) only because the phrase 'Pearson account won't\
    \ manage itself' was removed rather than recontextualized, though this was a necessary\
    \ sacrifice for the fix. Writing quality is professional with no new errors."
