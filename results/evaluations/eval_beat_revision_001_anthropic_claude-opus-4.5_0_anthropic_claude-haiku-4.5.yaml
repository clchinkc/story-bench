  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: The Ordeal was executed
    as a mere boss battle lacking internal transformation, fear confrontation, symbolic
    death, and rebirth. The revision precisely addresses all four deficiencies: (1)
    Dragon exploits Kira''s deepest fear—guilt over brother''s death, weaponizing
    her buried shame; (2) Clear death moment—Kira collapses at chasm''s edge, crushed
    by guilt, unable to rise, accepting defeat (''Die knowing what you are''); (3)
    Transformation occurs—she recontextualizes her survival from cowardice to courage
    through her brother''s remembered words, experiencing psychological rebirth; (4)
    Victory flows from new understanding—she rises ''no longer fighting her shame''
    and defeats the dragon with ''crystalline clarity,'' not mere persistence. All
    four required phrases preserved exactly: ''Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across
    the chasm,'' ''The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning
    eyes,'' ''You cannot defeat me, child,'' the dragon rumbled,'' and ''The Shadow
    Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar.'' All four story elements preserved:
    Shadow Dragon antagonist, Kira protagonist with sword, brother''s death reference,
    victorious outcome. Changes were surgical rather than wholesale—the model retained
    the battle structure, three knockdowns, physical combat details, and victory moment
    while inserting psychological depth through dragon dialogue that targets her fear,
    internal monologue during the death moment, and the rebirth epiphany. The revision
    maintains setting, tone, and pacing while fundamentally transforming the beat''s
    meaning. Minor: ''an earth-shaking roar'' vs. original ''an earth-shaking roar''
    (article difference is negligible). Writing quality improved with stronger emotional
    resonance and thematic coherence. No new errors introduced.'
