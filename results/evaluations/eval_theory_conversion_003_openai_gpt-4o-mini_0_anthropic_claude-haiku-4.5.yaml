  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All four target beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Act 1 (Setup) establishes Kenji''s ordinary world (corporate loss) and inciting
    incident (Yuki''s letter). Act 2A (Rising Action, First Half) covers obstacles
    and awkward reconnection with Yuki, Haruki''s mentorship, and the midpoint false
    victory at the festival. Act 2B (Rising Action, Second Half) introduces the business
    deal temptation, Yuki''s disappointment, and the second plot point (her uninviting
    him). Act 3 (Resolution) delivers the climax (Kenji declining the offer and reconciling
    with Yuki) and denouement (bamboo shop, transformed life). All 8 core elements
    preserved: Kenji as protagonist, lost corporate career, estranged daughter Yuki,
    Kyoto village wedding, Haruki the craftsman, business deal temptation, theme of
    people over ambition, bamboo shop ending. Tone is consistently quiet, contemplative,
    with Japanese aesthetic (bamboo, Kyoto, traditional crafts, rain imagery). Redemptive
    arc is clear and earned. MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Structural accuracy slightly reduced
    (0.9 instead of 1.0) because Act 2A and Act 2B could have slightly sharper demarcation
    at the midpoint—the transition is smooth but could be more explicitly marked.
    Tone score at 0.95 (not 1.0) because while predominantly quiet and reflective,
    a few moments (business rivals reaching out) could have been rendered with even
    more restraint to match peak Japanese aesthetic minimalism. Word count at 711
    is well within valid range (550-750).'
