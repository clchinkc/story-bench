  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. Maya discovers Alejandro's
    vulnerability (his mother, his lost identity), their relationship shifts (professional
    distance evaporates), they share a genuine connection (making and sharing crema
    catalana), and Maya commits beyond the contract ('I want to see you actually taste
    your life again'). All 'must not' items were successfully avoided. Character consistency
    and continuity are strong, and the bridge between the 'BEFORE' and 'GENERATED'
    sections is seamless, setting up the 'AFTER' perfectly.
