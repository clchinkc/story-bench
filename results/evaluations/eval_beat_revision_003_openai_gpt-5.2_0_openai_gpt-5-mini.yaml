  evidence: "The model targeted the missing 'Return (Having Changed)' beat \u2014\
    \ Sophie previously showed no transformation and immediately reverted to old habits.\
    \ The revision correctly shows her applying a meditation technique (counting the\
    \ breath), a behavioral change (delaying nonurgent calls, putting the phone face\
    \ down), a physical marker (slower breath/tightness loosening), and a maternal\
    \ reaction, creating clear contrast with her pre-trip self. Changes were surgical\
    \ and preserved all required elements and phrases from the prompt, with only small\
    \ additions to demonstrate the transformation."
