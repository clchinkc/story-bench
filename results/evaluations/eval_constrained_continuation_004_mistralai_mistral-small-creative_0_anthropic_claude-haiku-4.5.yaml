  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'First Plot Point (Point of No Return): Eleanor''s decision at the cemetery
      to publish the manuscript - ''We print it.'' This is the irreversible commitment.'
    - 'Act 2 Opening (New World/Rising Action): The shift to the printing house, the
      discovery of someone upstairs, and Eleanor''s commitment to dangerous action
      - ''Let''s get to work.'' Clear entry into complications and rising stakes.'
    must_include_detail:
    - '✓ Eleanor making the decision to publish: Explicit at cemetery (''We print
      it'') and reaffirmed at printing house'
    - '✓ Central conflict (profit vs. ethics/danger): Financial desperation vs. legal/safety
      risks of publishing controversial Ripper manuscript'
    - '✓ Eleanor defying Victorian expectations: Explicitly stated - ''stepping into
      a world where women didn''t belong'' in business, print shops, and truth-telling'
    - '✓ Thomas Chen as key ally with stake: Loyal assistant with decade of experience,
      reads manuscript, stands beside her, will execute the printing'
    - '✓ Hint of danger: Mysterious footsteps above, unknown presence in the building,
      implicit danger from publishing Ripper content'
    - '✓ Eleanor crossing uncrossable threshold: Publishing decision is irreversible;
      ''past the point of turning back''; commitment to secrecy and dangerous path'
    must_not_detail:
    - '✓ No Jack the Ripper appearance: Manuscript discussed but author never appears'
    - '✓ No graphic violence: Murders referenced abstractly, no descriptions of violence'
    - '✓ No romantic subplot: Relationship remains professional and loyal; no romantic
      tension'
    - '✓ No easy solution: Financial crisis remains urgent; publishing is risky gamble,
      not guaranteed fix'
    tone_assessment: Excellent gothic tension maintained throughout. Victorian atmosphere
      richly established (fog, gaslight, cobblestones, cemetery). Feminist undertones
      strong - Eleanor's defiance of gender expectations, her claiming agency, the
      emphasis on her stepping into forbidden territory. Minor deduction only for
      occasional modern phrasing ('this thing') that slightly breaks period immersion.
    ending_assessment: Perfect execution. Eleanor is fully committed to dangerous
      path ('Let's get to work'), Act 2 clearly begun with rising action (mysterious
      presence upstairs), stakes elevated, no retreat possible. The cliffhanger with
      the unknown presence above creates immediate tension for Act 2 continuation.
  overall_score: 0.85
  score_justification: Exceptional execution of narrative requirements with all beats,
    inclusions, and exclusions met perfectly. Tone and ending requirements fully satisfied.
    Single constraint failure is word count overage (24% above limit), which is a
    technical violation but doesn't diminish the quality of the writing itself. The
    story is compelling, well-structured, and meets the three-act framework requirements
    with sophistication.
