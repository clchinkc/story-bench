  evidence: The 'Meeting the Mentor' beat is somewhat weak. While she finds her grandmother's
    journal, there isn't a direct 'meeting' or guidance in the traditional sense,
    more of a discovery of past wisdom. The 'Refusal of the Call' is present but subtle,
    mainly internal struggle during the journey rather than an explicit refusal. The
    word count is below the requested range.
