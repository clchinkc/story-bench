  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation
    and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.
    The revision fixes this by: (1) Sophie deliberately NOT checking her phone despite
    anxiety—demonstrating changed behavior; (2) Explicit insight integrated (''sit
    with discomfort instead of running from it''); (3) Physical markers of change
    (phone in airplane mode, noticing shoulders were hunched, seeing city differently);
    (4) Clear contrast (''three weeks ago she would have already been scrolling''
    vs. now she resists); (5) Mother''s observation of difference (''Usually Sophie
    would be checking emails before they''d even left the parking garage''). All 4
    required phrases preserved exactly: ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare'', ''How
    was Thailand? her mother asked'', ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'', ''It''s
    good to be home, she said''. All 4 story elements preserved (Sophie, Thailand
    retreat, Chicago return, work pressure). Changes were surgical rather than wholesale—the
    model kept the scene structure, dialogue framework, and setting intact while inserting
    transformation evidence. The revision adds ~100 words of internal monologue and
    behavioral contrast rather than replacing sections. Minor: the phrase ''It''s
    good to be home'' gains new meaning through context but maintains original wording.
    Beat execution is nearly perfect—shows return to ordinary world with demonstrable
    change through action, perspective, and external validation.'
