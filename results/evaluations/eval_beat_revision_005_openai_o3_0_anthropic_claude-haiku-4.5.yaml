  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive
    reasoning. It accurately mapped the segment against all five key Dark Night of
    the Soul requirements: (1) follows major defeat (gallery closure), (2) protagonist
    isolated (dark apartment, unanswered calls), (3) genuine despair and self-recrimination
    (sitting on floor, tears, failed promises), (4) no solutions offered (wallowing
    phase), and (5) whiff of death element (hospice memory, mother''s passing). The
    model demonstrated strong beat understanding by explaining not just what the beat
    is, but why this specific segment executes it effectively. No unnecessary revisions
    were suggested. The reasoning was thorough, specific to the text, and avoided
    the false positive of over-diagnosing problems in well-executed material.'
