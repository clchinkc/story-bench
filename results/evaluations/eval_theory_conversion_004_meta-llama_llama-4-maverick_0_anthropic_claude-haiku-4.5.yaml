  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly mapped: (1) You—opening
    library comfort zone; (2) Need—''quiet desperation gnawed at her''; (3) Go—accepts
    recorder, enters oral history program; (4) Search—multiple interview attempts,
    learning to listen; (5) Find—Bernard''s breakthrough moment (''You''re the first
    person''); (6) Take—town hall presentation requiring vulnerability; (7) Return—life
    continues, visits Bernard, funeral speech; (8) Change—journalism applications,
    transformed identity. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe, library, Ms. Okafor,
    Bernard Park, social anxiety, town hall, Bernard''s death, journalism ending.
    Structure elegantly weaves Campbell''s monomyth into Harmon''s circular framework.
    Minor deduction (0.05) for structural_accuracy: the ''Take'' beat could be slightly
    more explicit about the ''price paid'' beyond emotional vulnerability. Tone is
    consistently gentle and intimate throughout, with emotionally resonant moments
    (Bernard''s gratitude, funeral speech, transformation reflection). Word count
    at 656 is valid within 500-700 range.'
