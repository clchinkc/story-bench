  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the ''telling vs. showing'' problem and
    revised the segment into a lived scene: Rachel tapping a pen, examining a photograph,
    Sherlock nudging a file, and James teasing her—these show instincts, devotion,
    and partnership through action and dialogue. Sensory detail (fluorescent hum,
    muted jazz) establishes setting. Required phrases (''Detective Rachel Torres'',
    ''Detective James Oyelaran'', ''Tuesday morning in October'', and the cat ''Sherlock'')
    are all present (the phrase ''cat named Sherlock'' appears in near-equivalent
    form). Preservation: four of five required elements preserved (Queens is mentioned,
    but the specific ''apartment'' detail was dropped). Changes were substantive rather
    than surgical (moderate rewrite) but appropriate to fix the flaw. Minor residual
    telling remains in a couple of lines describing her drive, preventing a perfect
    score for flaw_correction.'
