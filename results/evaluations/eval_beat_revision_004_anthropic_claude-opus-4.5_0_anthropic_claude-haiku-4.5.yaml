  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—that the original
    segment was pure exposition-as-summary (telling, not showing) with no grounded
    scene, sensory detail, or characteristic behavior. The revision demonstrates clear
    understanding by transforming the entire approach into a lived scene.


    FLAW CORRECTION: Fully addressed. The revision eliminates all info-dump language
    (''She was known for,'' ''She enjoyed,'' ''She had never married'') and replaces
    it with SHOWN behavior: Rachel obsessing over a cold case at 6:30 AM, interacting
    with Sherlock naturally, receiving a call from James that reveals their 12-year
    partnership through dialogue and his knowledge of her habits, and sensory grounding
    (gray October sky, brick buildings, Manhattan skyline). The partnership is now
    demonstrated through James''s familiar tone and his ability to predict her actions,
    not stated as fact.


    BEAT EXECUTION: Exposition requirements met: (1) Setting established through sensory
    detail (kitchen table, grainy photograph, low gray sky, cramped brick buildings);
    (2) Protagonist introduced through characteristic behavior (obsessing over unsolved
    case, working at 6:30 AM, keeping separate files); (3) Relationships shown through
    interaction (James''s dialogue reveals mutual respect and long history); (4) Investment
    created (the Mendez file mystery, Sherlock''s backstory hint). The ordinary world
    before disruption is clear.


    PRESERVATION: All 5 elements preserved: ''Detective Rachel Torres'' (present),
    ''Detective James Oyelaran'' (present in dialogue), ''cat named Sherlock'' (present,
    integrated naturally), ''Queens apartment'' (present), ''October Tuesday'' (present:
    ''Tuesday in October''). All 4 required phrases present.


    MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is NOT a minimal surgical edit—it''s a substantial
    structural rewrite. The original ~280 words of summary were replaced with ~251
    words of scene-based narrative. However, this level of change was NECESSARY to
    fix the fundamental flaw (telling vs. showing). The model did not preserve the
    original text structure; it rebuilt from the ground up. This represents a 0.3
    on the minimal_change scale because while the word count stayed similar and all
    required elements were preserved, the entire narrative approach was reconstructed.


    QUALITY: Excellent. No new errors introduced. Prose is professional, sensory details
    are vivid (''grainy surveillance still,'' ''orange tail sweeping,'' ''low and
    gray''), dialogue feels natural, and the pacing builds intrigue. The Sherlock
    backstory hint (''the only living witness to something he''d never tell'') adds
    depth. The ending hook (''So was whatever this Tuesday would bring'') effectively
    transitions to rising action.'
error: null
