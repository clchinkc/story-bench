  evidence: "All 12 Hero's Journey beats are present and clearly articulated: (1)\
    \ Ordinary World\u2014Maya's coastal studio and simple pottery; (2) Call to Adventure\u2014\
    the dried spring and elders' request; (3) Refusal\u2014'I make bowls,' her fear\
    \ and doubt; (4) Meeting the Mentor\u2014grandmother's journal discovered in ruins;\
    \ (5) Crossing the Threshold\u2014the three-day mountain journey; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies\u2014\
    forest obstacles, memories as allies, doubt as enemy; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave\u2014\
    reaching the ruined shrine; (8) Ordeal\u2014the night of surrender and clay-working;\
    \ (9) Reward\u2014the completed vessel and understanding of mastery; (10) Road\
    \ Back\u2014return journey with burden; (11) Resurrection\u2014placing vessel\
    \ at spring, transformation complete; (12) Return with Elixir\u2014water returns,\
    \ Maya teaches listening. All 7 core elements preserved: Maya (protagonist), pottery\
    \ (central skill), grandmother's legacy (journal, techniques, tools), mountain\
    \ shrine (journey destination), dried spring (central problem), surrender theme\
    \ (explicit throughout, climactic moment), transformation (from functional potter\
    \ to master/bridge). Tone is consistently quiet, meditative, and transformative\u2014\
    lyrical language ('steady rhythm,' 'damp clay,' 'deep green silence'), introspective\
    \ moments, and spiritual undertones maintained throughout. Minor deduction (0.05)\
    \ for structural accuracy: the 'Tests, Allies, Enemies' beat could be more distinctly\
    \ separated as individual narrative moments rather than compressed into the journey\
    \ sequence, though the content is present. Minor tone deduction (0.05): one moment\
    \ ('Her heart sank') edges slightly toward melodrama rather than pure meditative\
    \ restraint, though overall tone remains strong."
