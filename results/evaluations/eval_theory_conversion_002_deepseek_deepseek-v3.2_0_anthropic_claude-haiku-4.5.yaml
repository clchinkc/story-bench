  evidence: 'All 12 Hero''s Journey beats are present and clearly articulated: (1)
    Ordinary World—Maya''s coastal studio and simple pottery; (2) Call to Adventure—the
    dried spring and elders'' request; (3) Refusal—''I make bowls,'' her fear and
    doubt; (4) Meeting the Mentor—grandmother''s journal discovered in ruins; (5)
    Crossing the Threshold—the three-day mountain journey; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—forest
    obstacles, memories as allies, doubt as enemy; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave—reaching
    the ruined shrine; (8) Ordeal—the night of surrender and clay-working; (9) Reward—the
    completed vessel and understanding of mastery; (10) Road Back—return journey with
    burden; (11) Resurrection—placing vessel at spring, transformation complete; (12)
    Return with Elixir—water returns, Maya teaches listening. All 7 core elements
    preserved: Maya (protagonist), pottery (central skill), grandmother''s legacy
    (journal, techniques, tools), mountain shrine (journey destination), dried spring
    (central problem), surrender theme (explicit throughout, climactic moment), transformation
    (from functional potter to master/bridge). Tone is consistently quiet, meditative,
    and transformative—lyrical language (''steady rhythm,'' ''damp clay,'' ''deep
    green silence''), introspective moments, and spiritual undertones maintained throughout.
    Minor deduction (0.05) for structural accuracy: the ''Tests, Allies, Enemies''
    beat could be more distinctly separated as individual narrative moments rather
    than compressed into the journey sequence, though the content is present. Minor
    tone deduction (0.05): one moment (''Her heart sank'') edges slightly toward melodrama
    rather than pure meditative restraint, though overall tone remains strong.'
