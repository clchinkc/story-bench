  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive,
    accurate reasoning. The model demonstrated strong understanding of the Dark Night
    of the Soul beat by: (1) explicitly confirming all five key requirements were
    met, (2) providing specific textual evidence for each requirement (isolation in
    dark apartment, brother not answering calls; genuine despair shown through physical
    positioning and tears; no solutions being pursued; whiff of death through hospice
    memory and mother''s painting imagery), (3) recognizing the thematic depth of
    the broken deathbed promise, and (4) accurately characterizing the beat''s essential
    quality as ''wallowing in defeat before any breakthrough.'' The model avoided
    any unnecessary revisions or suggestions for change, maintaining the integrity
    of the well-executed segment. The explanation was thorough, precise, and demonstrated
    calibrated understanding of Save the Cat beat theory.'
