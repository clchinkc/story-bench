  analysis:
    beats_analysis: 'All three required beats are present and well-executed. SEARCH:
      Jin adapts to Collective culture through Jessa''s mentorship, learning protocols,
      reputation systems, and social rituals. FIND: Jin discovers the Y.L._GRO prototype—his
      own chemistry reimagined for microgravity by Yuna, revealing the tech exists
      and has been developed in secret. TAKE: Jin makes a moral compromise, masking
      the advanced module and releasing only terrestrial-optimized schemas, paying
      prices including probationary status, lost allies, and ethical complicity.'
    must_include_analysis: 'All 6 elements present: (1) Jin navigates Collective politics—Agora
      stacks, reputation ledgers, rotating facilitators, contract negotiations; (2)
      Jessa Anwar serves as mentor, teaching protocols and providing crucial backing;
      (3) Unexpected discovery—the Y.L._GRO prototype exists, developed by Yuna, revealing
      orbital leverage implications; (4) Jin finds safety/platform—research cell,
      streaming access, scheduled hearing; (5) Action with cost—releases partial code,
      gains lab but loses committee allies and gains probationary status; (6) Moral
      compromise—withholds advanced microgravity optimizations using same logic as
      enemies.'
    must_not_analysis: 'All 4 forbidden elements successfully avoided: (1) No easy
      integration—Jin struggles with protocols, terminology, rituals throughout; (2)
      No Earth family contact—only references are to Yuna (colleague, not family)
      and abstract Earth civilians; (3) No violence or weapons—conflict is entirely
      political and contractual; (4) No complete conspiracy resolution—the larger
      Council plot remains active, only partial disclosure achieved.'
    tone_analysis: Contemplative and politically charged tone maintained throughout.
      Personal stakes are intimate (Jin's exile, moral compromise) while embedded
      in larger systemic conflict (Council suppression, orbital leverage, trade sanctions).
      Language is introspective ('moral algebra refused to balance') and technically
      precise. Minor deduction only for occasional moments of plot momentum that slightly
      outpace reflection.
    ending_analysis: 'Perfectly executed ''Take'' ending. Jin has gained: lab access,
      voice in Agora, platform for continued work. He has paid: probationary status,
      narrowed corridor map, committee allies (Jessa), and most significantly, moral
      complicity with the partial-truth logic of his enemies. The ending captures
      the core requirement—gain with cost—and leaves the larger conspiracy unresolved,
      maintaining tension.'
    critical_issue: The submission significantly exceeds the word count constraint.
      At 1174 words against a 750-word maximum, it is 56.5% over the limit. This is
      a hard constraint violation that would typically result in rejection in professional
      contexts. However, the content quality is exceptional—all story elements are
      present, the narrative is sophisticated, and the ending is precisely calibrated.
      The excess length comes from rich detail and nuanced character development rather
      than padding or redundancy.
