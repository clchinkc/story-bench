  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Marcus still had multiple
    viable options (fundraiser, grant, new location) and intact support systems, creating
    a ''setback'' rather than ''rock bottom.'' The revision systematically eliminates
    all escape routes: fundraiser failed (50k short), grant denied, board resigned
    and froze accounts, Denise abandons him, wife withdraws savings and leaves. The
    ''whiff of death'' is executed through multiple losses—professional failure, marital
    dissolution, financial ruin, and loss of identity/purpose. Marcus is genuinely
    hopeless with no cards left to play. All 4 required phrases preserved exactly:
    ''Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands,'' ''Thirty days to vacate
    the community center,'' ''"There has to be something we can do," said Denise,''
    and ''He rubbed his temples.'' All 4 story elements preserved: Marcus as protagonist,
    community center setting, eviction crisis, Denise present throughout. Changes
    were surgical but substantial—the original''s hopeful tone (multiple plans, wife''s
    supportive text, ''maybe'' attitude) was completely inverted to despair. The expansion
    from ~180 words to 319 words was necessary to properly execute the beat; this
    represents justified expansion rather than bloat. Writing quality is professional
    with strong emotional resonance, no grammatical errors, and effective use of metaphor
    (''tomb,'' ''funeral march,'' ''corpse''). The minimal_change_score reflects that
    while core phrases were preserved, the emotional architecture and narrative content
    were substantially rewritten—this was unavoidable given the severity of the original
    flaw.'
