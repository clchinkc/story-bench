  evidence: The story successfully maps all 8 Hero's Journey beats to the Story Circle.
    All 8 core elements are preserved. The tone is perfectly maintained. The structural
    accuracy is good, but the 'Go' and 'Search' beats feel a little drawn out compared
    to the concise nature of the original prompt's beats, making the pacing slightly
    uneven for a direct conversion, though it works well as a standalone story.
