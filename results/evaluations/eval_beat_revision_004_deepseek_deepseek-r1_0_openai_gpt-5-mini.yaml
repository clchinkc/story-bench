  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw (telling vs. showing) by replacing
    exposition with a lived precinct scene: sensory detail (October chill, fluorescent
    buzz, radio static), Rachel''s detective behavior (spotting a witness discrepancy),
    and partnership shown through dialogue and ritual (coffee banter). The cat and
    Queens apartment are integrated naturally. All five core elements were preserved,
    but two of the four required exact/near-exact phrases were not present verbatim
    («Detective James Oyelaran» and «cat named Sherlock»), so required_preserved_score
    is partial. Changes were moderate rather than surgical—the text was restructured
    into a scene rather than minimally edited—hence a midscore for minimal_change.
    Writing quality is high with no major errors.'
