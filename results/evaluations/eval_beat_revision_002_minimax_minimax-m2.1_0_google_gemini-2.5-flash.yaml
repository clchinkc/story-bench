  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true 'All Is Lost' moment. It addressed the flaw by removing Marcus's options
    (fundraiser, grant application), isolating him through the betrayal of Denise
    and his wife, and showing him genuinely giving up hope and weeping. The 'whiff
    of death' is present in the metaphorical loss of his family (youth program kids)
    and the literal loss of his wife and assistant. The changes were significant enough
    to fix the flaw but still maintained the core structure and initial dialogue of
    the original segment, making them reasonably minimal given the extent of the required
    fix.
