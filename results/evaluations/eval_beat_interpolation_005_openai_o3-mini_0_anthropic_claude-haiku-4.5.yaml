  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All four required elements present and well-executed. (1)
    Alejandro''s vulnerability about his career-ending injury and emotional scars
    is revealed organically through the cooking scene. (2) Professional boundary shifts
    as he''s drawn into the kitchen and shares intimate confession. (3) Shared moment
    of genuine connection through culinary passion and kitchen intimacy is palpable
    and earned. (4) Maya''s commitment deepens beyond contract—she chooses to stay
    for healing and companionship, not just salary. The beat perfectly executes the
    midpoint function: raising emotional stakes, shifting Maya from reactive (taking
    the job) to proactive (choosing deeper involvement), and creating a point of no
    return. All must-not items avoided: they''re not already in love (connection is
    nascent), Maya doesn''t leave or breach contract, the photograph isn''t taken
    during this scene, and Alejandro''s walls genuinely lower. Character consistency
    strong—Alejandro''s hesitant curiosity and rare vulnerability feel earned given
    his reclusive nature; Maya''s perceptiveness and emotional intelligence align
    with her character. Minor deduction (0.05) on character score for slightly purple
    prose (''mellowness,'' ''infinitely more personal'') that occasionally edges toward
    telling rather than showing. Bridge between beats is seamless—BEFORE establishes
    the stakes and her motivation; GENERATED shows the emotional turning point; AFTER''s
    photograph and betrayal accusation hit harder because we''ve witnessed the genuine
    connection. Setting continuity perfect: kitchen established, sunset balcony mentioned
    naturally, villa maintained throughout.'
