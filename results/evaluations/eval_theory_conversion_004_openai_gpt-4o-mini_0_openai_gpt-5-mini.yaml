  evidence: 'All eight Dan Harmon beats are clearly present and in the correct sequence.
    All eight core elements (Zoe, library/oral-history program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard
    Park, Zoe''s social anxiety, town-hall presentation, Bernard''s death, journalism
    application) are preserved. Small, conservative deductions: the ''Take'' (pay
    price) beat is handled well as responsibility at the town-hall but could show
    a slightly clearer cost/consequence beyond performance; likewise the ''Change''
    beat is strong but compresses showing into a few actions (funeral speech and application)
    rather than an extended demonstration. Tone remains gentle and intimate throughout.'
