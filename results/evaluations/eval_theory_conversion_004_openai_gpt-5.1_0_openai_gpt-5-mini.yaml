  evidence: "All eight Harmonian beats are present and sequenced correctly: Zoe\u2019\
    s comfort in the library (You), her longing/need to stop hiding (Need), joining\
    \ the oral-history project (Go), learning interviewing craft (Search), the breakthrough\
    \ with Bernard (Find), assuming responsibility at the town-hall reading (Take),\
    \ returning to the library and daily life (Return), and clear behavioral change\
    \ (Change). All eight required elements (Zoe, library/program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard,\
    \ Zoe\u2019s anxiety, town-hall presentation, Bernard\u2019s death, journalism/college\
    \ arc) are retained. Deductions: structural_accuracy_score slightly below perfect\
    \ because a couple of beats are lightly blended (the 'Take' beat is framed as\
    \ ethical responsibility rather than a heavier price/sacrifice, and the final\
    \ 'journalism' resolution implies application and public speaking but stops short\
    \ of an explicit acceptance into a program), and the tone_score is marginally\
    \ reduced to reflect very minor moments where exposition slightly outweighs interior\
    \ intimacy. Word count is invalid per the requested 500\u2013700 range (the provided\
    \ text is ~1,350 words)."
