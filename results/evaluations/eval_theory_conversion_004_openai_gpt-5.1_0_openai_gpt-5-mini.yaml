  evidence: 'All eight Harmonian beats are present and sequenced correctly: Zoe’s
    comfort in the library (You), her longing/need to stop hiding (Need), joining
    the oral-history project (Go), learning interviewing craft (Search), the breakthrough
    with Bernard (Find), assuming responsibility at the town-hall reading (Take),
    returning to the library and daily life (Return), and clear behavioral change
    (Change). All eight required elements (Zoe, library/program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard,
    Zoe’s anxiety, town-hall presentation, Bernard’s death, journalism/college arc)
    are retained. Deductions: structural_accuracy_score slightly below perfect because
    a couple of beats are lightly blended (the ''Take'' beat is framed as ethical
    responsibility rather than a heavier price/sacrifice, and the final ''journalism''
    resolution implies application and public speaking but stops short of an explicit
    acceptance into a program), and the tone_score is marginally reduced to reflect
    very minor moments where exposition slightly outweighs interior intimacy. Word
    count is invalid per the requested 500–700 range (the provided text is ~1,350
    words).'
