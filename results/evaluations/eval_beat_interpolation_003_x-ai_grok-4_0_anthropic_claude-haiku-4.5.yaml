  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Multiple\
    \ station areas explored (crew quarters, medical bay, Lab Seven approach); (2)\
    \ Clues discovered progressively (terminal logs about dimensional barriers, autopsy\
    \ report on cellular decoherence, Kronin's Disease context); (3) Transformed crew\
    \ encountered as mysterious shimmer entities with escalating threat level; (4)\
    \ Multiple obstacles overcome (scanner malfunction, life support alarms, security\
    \ lockdown hacking, psychological pressure). The Search beat is authentically\
    \ executed\u2014Yuki adapts her approach (recalibrating scanner frequency), faces\
    \ mounting dread, and makes incremental progress through investigation and problem-solving.\
    \ All must-not violations avoided: she doesn't immediately find the data core\
    \ (only locates its destination), crew doesn't explain everything (only Commander\
    \ Reyes's cryptic encouragement at the end), she commits to mission completion,\
    \ and she arrives without prior knowledge of dimensional transformation. Character\
    \ voice remains consistent\u2014scientific method applied under duress, logical\
    \ problem-solving mixed with growing horror. Bridge between beats is seamless:\
    \ BEFORE establishes the mystery, GENERATED shows active investigation and discovery,\
    \ AFTER reveals the truth she's been searching for. Continuity perfect: setting\
    \ details (red emergency lighting, Jupiter viewport, station layout) maintained\
    \ throughout. ONLY ISSUE: Word count exceeds range by 72 words (472 vs. 250-400\
    \ max), which is a technical violation but doesn't affect narrative quality or\
    \ beat execution."
