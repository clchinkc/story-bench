  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw: Sophie now demonstrates a clear,
    observable change on Return. Instead of immediately reacting to work, she notices
    the vibrating phone, intentionally silences it, slides it into her purse, and
    decides the emergencies can wait—showing a new boundary and application of the
    retreat''s lesson (the value of stillness). The skyline is reframed through her
    new perspective and her mother anticipates Sophie''s old frantic response, which
    highlights the contrast. Changes were minimal and surgical: four required phrases
    and key scene elements were preserved verbatim, with added lines to demonstrate
    transformation (phone behavior, internal reframing, physical relaxation). Minor
    shortcoming: the revision could name or slightly more concretely tie the retreat
    practice (e.g., a specific technique or mantra) to the decision, but it largely
    satisfies the Return (Having Changed) beat.'
