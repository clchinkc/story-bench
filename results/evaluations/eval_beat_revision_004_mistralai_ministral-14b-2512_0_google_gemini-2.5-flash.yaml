  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' for exposition. It successfully revised the segment to show
    Rachel's detective skills, her relationship with James, her devotion to work/cold
    cases, and the setting through sensory details and action. The changes were extensive,
    indicating a low minimal_change_score, but necessary to fix the fundamental flaw.
    The 'Tuesday morning in October' was not explicitly included, but 'October air'
    was, which is close enough for the setting. The Queens apartment was not explicitly
    mentioned, but the precinct setting is well-established.
