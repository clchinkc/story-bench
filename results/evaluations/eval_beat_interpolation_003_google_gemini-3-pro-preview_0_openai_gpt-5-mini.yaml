  evidence: "All four required elements are present: exploration of multiple areas\
    \ (mess hall, Medical Bay, maintenance ladder/research level, approach to Lab\
    \ Seven), discovery of medical logs showing biometrics, encounters with shimmering/distortion\
    \ forms of the crew, and overcoming obstacles (manual override, climbing vibrating\
    \ ladder). No forbidden items appear (no immediate data-core discovery or explanations,\
    \ no departure, no prior knowledge). Word count is out of the requested range.\
    \ Minor deduction to bridge_score (0.95) for a slight abruptness in transition\
    \ into the research corridor/Lab Seven\u2014otherwise the beat functions and continuity\
    \ are solid."
