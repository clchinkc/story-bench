  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified that the Ordeal needed internal/psychological\
    \ transformation alongside external conflict. It recognized the need to weave\
    \ Kira's guilt about her brother's death into the dragon's attacks, making the\
    \ battle a confrontation with her deepest fear rather than just a physical challenge.\
    \ This diagnosis is substantially correct (0.85).\n\nFLAW CORRECTION: The revision\
    \ partially fixes the actual flaw. STRENGTHS: (1) Dragon now explicitly exploits\
    \ Kira's guilt ('You will join him soon,' 'their failures haunt their kin'), directly\
    \ confronting her internal fear; (2) Added psychological vulnerability ('weight\
    \ of despair,' 'darkness threatened to swallow her,' 'flame of her guilt'); (3)\
    \ Transformation is present\u2014she shifts from guilt-driven to strength-driven\
    \ ('carrying her brother's memory as strength instead of sorrow'). WEAKNESSES:\
    \ (1) The 'death' moment is weak\u2014'darkness threatened to swallow her' is\
    \ metaphorical but lacks the visceral surrender required by true Ordeal structure.\
    \ She never truly accepts defeat or lets go; (2) The transformation, while present,\
    \ feels more like emotional resolution than rebirth. She doesn't emerge fundamentally\
    \ changed in capability or understanding\u2014she still wins through persistence\
    \ with added emotional clarity; (3) No clear moment where she 'dies' psychologically\
    \ (surrenders, accepts failure, loses sense of self). The revision adds internal\
    \ conflict but doesn't fully execute the symbolic death-rebirth cycle. Score:\
    \ 0.75.\n\nBEAT SATISFACTION: The revision moves toward proper Ordeal execution\
    \ but falls short of full satisfaction. It includes confrontation with fear (0.9/1.0)\
    \ and transformation (0.7/1.0), but the 'death' moment remains underdeveloped\
    \ (0.5/1.0). The victory still derives primarily from persistence rather than\
    \ new understanding (0.7/1.0). Overall: 0.72.\n\nPRESERVATION: All 4 required\
    \ phrases present: (1) 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm' \u2713\
    ; (2) 'The creature was massive\u2014twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning\
    \ eyes' \u2713; (3) '\"You cannot defeat me, child,\" the dragon rumbled' \u2713\
    ; (4) 'The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar' \u2713. All 4 preserved\
    \ elements intact. Score: 1.0.\n\nMINIMAL CHANGES: The revision is NOT minimally\
    \ surgical. Approximately 40-45% of the text was rewritten or substantially modified:\
    \ new dragon dialogue added ('their failures haunt their kin,' 'You will join\
    \ him soon'), internal monologue expanded significantly ('weight of despair,'\
    \ 'darkness threatened to swallow her,' 'flame of her guilt'), new final paragraph\
    \ added ('transformed, carrying her brother's memory as strength instead of sorrow').\
    \ While the core structure and key phrases remain, the changes are moderate rather\
    \ than surgical. Score: 0.65.\n\nQUALITY: Writing quality is good with no new\
    \ errors introduced. Prose flows naturally, emotional beats land effectively,\
    \ and the additions integrate smoothly with original text. Minor note: 'an earth-shaking\
    \ roar' should be 'a earth-shaking roar' (original had 'an' which is technically\
    \ incorrect but preserved). Score: 0.8."
