  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: multiple areas explored (quarters,
    mess, Lab 4, corridors, Lab Seven), clues discovered (scattered effects, half-eaten
    meal, frantic log), encounters with transformed crew (flickers/shimmer/whispers),
    and an obstacle overcome (locked door bypassed). None of the forbidden items occur
    (no immediate data-core discovery or explicit explanation by crew, no leaving,
    no prior knowledge). Character behavior and setting continuity remain consistent
    and the scene cleanly bridges arrival to the subsequent discovery.'
