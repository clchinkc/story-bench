  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw\u2014Sophie showing\
    \ no transformation and immediately reverting to old workaholic patterns. The\
    \ revision demonstrates clear understanding that the Return beat requires behavioral\
    \ change, not just physical return. FLAW CORRECTION: The revision successfully\
    \ addresses all 5 sub-requirements: (1) Sophie responds differently to work stress\
    \ (deliberate pause, conscious choice vs. automatic response), (2) specific insight\
    \ integrated ('truly listen,' 'choose when to answer'), (3) physical marker (phone\
    \ set aside with deliberate care, contrasted with original scrolling), (4) visible\
    \ contrast (calm conviction, newfound steadiness vs. implied previous anxiety),\
    \ (5) mother noticing difference (implied through Sophie's changed demeanor and\
    \ tone). REQUIRED PHRASES: All 4 preserved exactly or near-exactly: 'Sophie's\
    \ flight landed at O'Hare' (present), 'How was Thailand?' (present), 'The familiar\
    \ Chicago skyline appeared' (present), 'It's good to be home,' she said' (present).\
    \ PRESERVATION: All 4 story elements intact\u2014Sophie, Thailand/meditation,\
    \ Chicago return, work pressures. MINIMAL CHANGES: Score 0.55 reflects moderate\
    \ surgical edits rather than minimal. The model expanded significantly (288 words\
    \ vs ~150 original), adding introspective passages ('her voice laced with calm\
    \ conviction,' 'fresh eyes,' 'quiet confidence'). However, changes were targeted\
    \ to the specific flaw location (Return beat) rather than wholesale rewrite. Original\
    \ structure preserved; additions are insertions rather than replacements. QUALITY:\
    \ Writing is strong with no new errors. Tone shift is appropriate and earned.\
    \ Minor concern: some phrasing feels slightly overwrought ('encapsulated her transformed\
    \ attitude') but remains professional. The revision demonstrates sophisticated\
    \ understanding of Story Circle mechanics and executes the beat requirement effectively."
