  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed all aspects of the Ordeal
    flaw. It introduced the dragon exploiting Kira's guilt over her brother's death,
    created a clear 'death' moment where she gives up due to this guilt, showed a
    rebirth/transformation where she finds new purpose, and her victory stems from
    this new understanding rather than just persistence. The changes were significant
    enough to fix the flaw but still maintained the core structure and many original
    phrases. One required phrase was slightly altered ('The Shadow Dragon collapsed
    with an earth-shaking roar' vs 'The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking
    roar'). The writing quality is high, and no new errors were introduced.
