  evidence: "All four required elements are present (multiple areas searched; clues/logs\
    \ discovered; ambiguous encounter with transformed crew; Yuki overcomes the immediate\
    \ threat and continues). No prohibited items appear (no immediate data-core discovery\
    \ or full explanation, no leaving, no prior knowledge). Character behavior is\
    \ consistent and the scene cleanly bridges the prior \u2018before\u2019 setup\
    \ to the subsequent \u2018find\u2019 beat; setting continuity is maintained."
