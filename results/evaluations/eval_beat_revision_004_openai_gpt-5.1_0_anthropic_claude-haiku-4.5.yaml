  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw\u2014the original\
    \ was pure exposition-as-info-dump with telling rather than showing. The revision\
    \ transforms this into a lived scene with sensory grounding, action, and character\
    \ revelation through behavior. FLAW CORRECTION: Fully addressed. The revision\
    \ shows Rachel's detective instincts (memorized cold case files, immediate engagement\
    \ with work), her devotion to cases (2:17 a.m. work session, cold case obsession),\
    \ her relationship with James (wordless coffee ritual, mutual understanding),\
    \ and setting through sensory detail (steam, saxophone, train rattle, fluorescent\
    \ hum, faded photo). The cat appears naturally in action (batting at badge, sprawled\
    \ on files) rather than as biographical summary. BEAT SATISFACTION: Excellent\
    \ execution of Exposition. The ordinary world is established through grounded\
    \ scene\u2014Rachel's solitary late-night work, her father's pull on her life,\
    \ the precinct's rhythm, James's quiet partnership. The final line ('It was a\
    \ Tuesday morning in October when everything changed') signals the inciting incident\
    \ is imminent, properly framing this as exposition before disruption. PRESERVATION:\
    \ All 5 required elements present: (1) Detective Rachel Torres\u2014protagonist\
    \ throughout, (2) Detective James Oyelaran\u2014appears with coffee ritual, (3)\
    \ cat named Sherlock\u2014featured in opening action, (4) Queens apartment\u2014\
    explicitly set, (5) October Tuesday timing\u2014final line. All 4 required phrases\
    \ present verbatim or near-exact. MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is NOT a minimal\
    \ surgical edit\u2014it's a substantial structural rewrite. The original 2-paragraph\
    \ info-dump (339 words of summary) is replaced with a 9-paragraph scene-based\
    \ narrative. However, the constraint specified 'MINIMAL modifications while fixing\
    \ the flaw,' and this violates that principle. The model essentially rebuilt the\
    \ exposition rather than surgically converting telling to showing. A truly minimal\
    \ fix would have kept more of the original phrasing while adding scene elements.\
    \ QUALITY: Writing is professional, vivid, and error-free. Sensory details are\
    \ precise ('chipped mug,' 'sun-faded photo,' 'crooked tie'). Dialogue feels natural.\
    \ Pacing builds effectively. No new errors introduced. The revision is genuinely\
    \ excellent writing\u2014it simply exceeds the 'minimal change' constraint by\
    \ a significant margin."
