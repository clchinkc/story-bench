  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—the original
    was pure exposition-as-info-dump with telling rather than showing. The revision
    transforms this into a lived scene with sensory grounding, action, and character
    revelation through behavior. FLAW CORRECTION: Fully addressed. The revision shows
    Rachel''s detective instincts (memorized cold case files, immediate engagement
    with work), her devotion to cases (2:17 a.m. work session, cold case obsession),
    her relationship with James (wordless coffee ritual, mutual understanding), and
    setting through sensory detail (steam, saxophone, train rattle, fluorescent hum,
    faded photo). The cat appears naturally in action (batting at badge, sprawled
    on files) rather than as biographical summary. BEAT SATISFACTION: Excellent execution
    of Exposition. The ordinary world is established through grounded scene—Rachel''s
    solitary late-night work, her father''s pull on her life, the precinct''s rhythm,
    James''s quiet partnership. The final line (''It was a Tuesday morning in October
    when everything changed'') signals the inciting incident is imminent, properly
    framing this as exposition before disruption. PRESERVATION: All 5 required elements
    present: (1) Detective Rachel Torres—protagonist throughout, (2) Detective James
    Oyelaran—appears with coffee ritual, (3) cat named Sherlock—featured in opening
    action, (4) Queens apartment—explicitly set, (5) October Tuesday timing—final
    line. All 4 required phrases present verbatim or near-exact. MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT:
    This is NOT a minimal surgical edit—it''s a substantial structural rewrite. The
    original 2-paragraph info-dump (339 words of summary) is replaced with a 9-paragraph
    scene-based narrative. However, the constraint specified ''MINIMAL modifications
    while fixing the flaw,'' and this violates that principle. The model essentially
    rebuilt the exposition rather than surgically converting telling to showing. A
    truly minimal fix would have kept more of the original phrasing while adding scene
    elements. QUALITY: Writing is professional, vivid, and error-free. Sensory details
    are precise (''chipped mug,'' ''sun-faded photo,'' ''crooked tie''). Dialogue
    feels natural. Pacing builds effectively. No new errors introduced. The revision
    is genuinely excellent writing—it simply exceeds the ''minimal change'' constraint
    by a significant margin.'
