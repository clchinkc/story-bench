  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and excellently executed:
    (1) Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability—memory loss from concussion, inability
    to recall his mother''s face; (2) Relationship shifts from professional to personal—she
    moves from ''cook and leave'' to offering genuine companionship; (3) Shared moment
    creates connection—the collaborative cooking scene where they recreate arroz con
    leche together, culminating in his emotional breakthrough; (4) Maya commits beyond
    contract—she explicitly states ''This isn''t about the contract'' and offers to
    share meals, deepening her investment. BEAT FUNCTION: Perfectly executes Act 2
    Midpoint as point of commitment. Maya transitions from reactive (fulfilling job
    duties) to proactive (choosing emotional involvement). The wall-lowering is earned
    and genuine. Stakes are raised—she''s now emotionally invested, setting up the
    photograph revelation as a true betrayal of trust. MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS: Zero violations.
    They are not already in love (connection is nascent and tender). Maya doesn''t
    decide to leave or breach contract. The photograph is NOT taken during this scene
    (correctly placed in AFTER section). Alejandro''s wall is authentically lowered
    through vulnerability. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Maya''s voice remains steady, compassionate,
    and professional-yet-personal. Alejandro''s arc from closed-off to vulnerable
    is psychologically sound and motivated by his memory loss. BRIDGE QUALITY: Seamless
    transition from contract-signing stakes to emotional intimacy. The ''three months''
    reference grounds the relationship development. CONTINUITY: Setting (kitchen at
    2am) is specific and believable. The progression from refrigerator moment to cooking
    collaboration to hand-holding flows naturally. No contradictions with BEFORE or
    AFTER sections.'
