  evidence: 'The revision clearly targeted the All Is Lost problem: it adds a failed/insufficient
    fundraiser (donations half of projection), an explicitly rejected grant, a personal
    betrayal (Denise accepts a job with the developer), and a concrete family pressure
    (school fees), leaving Marcus isolated and emotionally crushed. These changes
    address the actual flaw (lack of hopelessness/isolation) and create a ''whiff
    of death'' (loss of program, support, financial stability, identity). All four
    required elements/phrases are preserved verbatim. Changes are moderate rather
    than surgical—the opening lines and key beats remain, but the middle was expanded
    to close off options and deepen the low point, so minimal_change_score is below
    ''surgical edits.'' Writing quality is strong with no major errors.'
