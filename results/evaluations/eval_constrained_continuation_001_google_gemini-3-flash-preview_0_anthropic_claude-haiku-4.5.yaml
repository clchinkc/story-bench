  failed_constraints:
  - 'Word count exceeds maximum: 785 words vs. 700-word limit (85 words over)'
  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'Approach to the Inmost Cave: Clearly marked with ''This was the Inmost Cave''
      and the descent through the obsidian door, the sealed chamber, and the sand
      vortex beginning'
    - 'The Ordeal: Fully realized through the sand pit sequence where Zara confronts
      her fears, achieves symbolic death/rebirth through surrender, and emerges transformed'
    must_include_detail:
    - 'Choice between safety and helping Tomás: Excellently executed—Zara chooses
      to save Tomás despite the open path to the Library and the approaching assassins'
    - 'Trap/test requiring thief skills: The Labyrinth Tumbler lock demonstrates Zara''s
      expertise and establishes her competence before the greater trial'
    - 'Revelation about Tomás''s motivation: Powerful reveal—he was the Librarian''s
      apprentice who betrayed the archives, creating the very crisis Zara faces'
    - 'Zara confronting fear of failure: Deeply explored through internal monologue
      (''You will fail her'') and the psychological weight of her past'
    - 'Symbolic death/rebirth moment: The sand pit sequence where she surrenders ego,
      ''the girl who stole only to survive died,'' and emerges with clarity and will'
    - 'Zara emerging changed: She transitions from victim to master of her will, from
      panic-driven to centered, from self-interested to compassionate'
    must_not_detail:
    - 'Cure not found: ✓ Avoided—the Library is reached but the cure remains unfound'
    - 'No romantic subplot: ✓ Avoided—relationship remains mentor/ally with moral
      complexity'
    - 'Tomás survives: ✓ Avoided—he is rescued and remains alive'
    - 'No supernatural abilities for Zara: ✓ Avoided—all abilities are thief skills
      (lock-picking, physical strength, mental discipline)'
    tone_assessment: Tense and morally complex throughout. Desperate hope evident
      in Zara's choice to save Tomás and her moment of surrender. The betrayal revelation
      adds moral complexity. Minor deduction only for slightly overwrought prose in
      places ('bone-cracking heave'), but overall maintains required tone excellently.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect execution: Zara has passed through the Ordeal (emerged
      from sand pit transformed), but faces immediate new complication (hall of mirrors,
      lost map). Sets up next stage of journey while maintaining tension.'
    strengths:
    - Masterful integration of both required beats with seamless narrative flow
    - All six must-include elements woven naturally into story rather than checklist-like
    - Excellent character development through action and revelation
    - Compelling internal conflict alongside external danger
    - Strong thematic resonance (surrender leading to strength, compassion over self-interest)
    weaknesses:
    - 'Word count violation: 85 words over limit is a clear constraint failure'
  overall_assessment: Exceptional storytelling with all narrative requirements met
    and tone perfectly calibrated. The only failure is the quantitative word count
    constraint. The story demonstrates sophisticated understanding of Campbell's monomyth
    structure and executes both required beats with narrative elegance. The character
    work is particularly strong, with Zara's transformation feeling earned rather
    than imposed.
