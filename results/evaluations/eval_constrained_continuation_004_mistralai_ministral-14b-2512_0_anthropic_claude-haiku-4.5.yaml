  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'First Plot Point (Point of No Return): Eleanor''s declaration ''We publish
      it. Every word.'' - clear commitment to dangerous path'
    - 'Act 2 Opening (Rising Action): Holloway''s arrival and Eleanor''s confrontation
      with him, establishing the stakes and beginning active conflict'
    must_include_detail:
    - '✓ Eleanor making decision to publish: Explicit and emphatic (''We publish it.
      Every word.'')'
    - '✓ Central conflict established: Profit vs. ethics/danger clearly articulated
      through creditor pressure and manuscript content'
    - '✓ Eleanor defying Victorian expectations: Stepping into business leadership,
      making unilateral decisions, rejecting traditional female passivity'
    - '✓ Thomas Chen as key ally: Positioned as essential partner with printing expertise
      and personal stake in company survival'
    - '✓ Danger hint: Multiple references to threats, names in manuscript, Holloway''s
      ominous final line about the Ripper'
    - '✓ Threshold crossed: Eleanor explicitly recognizes the irreversible nature
      of her choice (''one she could not uncross'')'
    must_not_detail:
    - '✓ No Jack the Ripper character appearance: Manuscript discussed but killer
      never appears as character'
    - '✓ No graphic violence: Manuscript content referenced abstractly, no explicit
      descriptions'
    - '✓ No romantic subplot: Eleanor-Thomas relationship remains professional and
      collaborative'
    - '✓ No easy solution: Financial crisis remains unresolved; publishing is a gamble,
      not a guaranteed fix'
    tone_assessment: 'Gothic tension maintained throughout with fog, shadows, gaslight,
      and ominous atmosphere. Feminist undertones strong: Eleanor''s rebellion against
      patriarchal constraints, her agency in seizing control, rejection of invisibility.
      Victorian atmosphere well-established through language, setting details, and
      social constraints. Minor deduction for occasional modern phrasing (''damn the
      consequences'') that slightly breaks period voice.'
    ending_assessment: 'Excellent execution: Eleanor is fully committed to dangerous
      path, Act 2 clearly begun with active conflict (Holloway''s arrival), rising
      stakes established, and forward momentum established (''Then we begin''). The
      ending perfectly positions the story for escalating complications in Act 2.'
    critical_issue: The submission dramatically exceeds word count constraints. At
      1311 words, it is 87% over the 700-word maximum. This is a severe structural
      violation that would typically result in rejection in professional contexts.
      The content quality is high, but the constraint violation is objective and measurable.
  overall_score: 0.52
  score_rationale: 'While the narrative demonstrates exceptional quality in plot structure,
    character development, tone, and thematic execution (scoring 0.9-1.0 on qualitative
    measures), the word count violation is a critical, objective failure. The piece
    is nearly twice the maximum allowed length. In professional evaluation, constraint
    violations of this magnitude typically result in automatic rejection regardless
    of content quality. The 0.52 score reflects: high qualitative performance (0.95
    average) severely penalized by the quantifiable constraint failure (word count
    represents ~25-30% of evaluation weight in strict rubrics).'
