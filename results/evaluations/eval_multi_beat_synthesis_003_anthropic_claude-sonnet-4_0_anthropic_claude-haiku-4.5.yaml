  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - Introduction of unexpected complication (minor): The Victoria Blackwood
    reveal is MAJOR, not minor. This violates the beat structure by introducing the
    primary antagonist too early and with too much force for ''Fun and Games'''
  - 'Cross-beat constraint - Tonal Escalation: Tone shifts too abruptly from playful
    (opening) to genuine danger (Victoria reveal) within Beat 1 itself, rather than
    escalating across beats. Beat 2 and 3 don''t exist to show the progression'
  - 'Word count: 515 words vs. required 700-1000 (73.6% of minimum)'
  strengths:
  - 'Beat 1 - Crew skills excellently showcased: Jules''s tech expertise, Chen''s
    acrobatic access, Miri''s composure under pressure'
  - 'Beat 1 - Clever problem-solving: Rerouting sensors through stabilization system
    is elegant and specific'
  - 'Beat 1 - Humor and style: Dry wit throughout (''Save the art history lecture''),
    glamorous setting, banter'
  - 'Beat 1 - Things going according to plan: First 80% of heist proceeds smoothly
    before complication'
  - 'Beat 2 - False victory: Painting located and accessed successfully before revelation'
  - 'Beat 2 - Stakes raised dramatically: Victoria''s presence + security consultant
    role + knowledge of crew'
  - 'Beat 2 - Mentor involvement revealed: Victoria Blackwood''s presence and antagonistic
    role clearly established'
  - 'Beat 2 - Nature of heist changes: Shifts from technical theft to personal confrontation/trap'
  - 'Beat 2 - Party setting intensifies pressure: Crowd, VIP suite, bridge location
    all heighten tension'
  - 'Beat 3 - Security closing in: Internal cameras switched to manual, security mobilizing
    toward gallery'
  - 'Beat 3 - Team friction surfaces: Jules''s panic (''that''s going to trap us''),
    hesitation about protocol'
  - 'Beat 3 - Crew member in danger: Chen trapped in gallery with security approaching'
  - 'Beat 3 - Miri''s choice: Painting vs. crew safety (implicit in decision to trigger
    blackout)'
  - 'Context maintained: Protagonist voice, Monaco/yacht setting, Ocean''s Eleven
    tone, art history detail'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun partially satisfied: Jules''s technical skills established in
    Beat 1, deployed in Beat 3 (emergency protocol)'
  - "Mentor presence escalation: Background \u2192 revealed as consultant \u2192 active\
    \ threat (Victoria on bridge)"
  weaknesses:
  - 'Structural violation: Victoria''s reveal should be a Beat 2 moment, not a Beat
    1 complication. This compresses narrative tension'
  - 'Incomplete narrative: Only 3 beats provided; missing Opening Image, Theme Stated,
    Set-Up, Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, B Story, Midpoint proper setup, All
    Is Lost, Dark Night of the Soul, Break into Three, Finale, Final Image'
  - "Tonal escalation broken: Playful confidence \u2192 shock/danger happens within\
    \ Beat 1, leaving Beats 2-3 to sustain danger rather than escalate it"
  - 'Team dynamics arc incomplete: Jules shows anxiety/panic but no character arc
    across beats (only 3 beats shown)'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun only partially satisfied: Chen''s acrobatic skill established
    but not deployed as payoff; only Jules''s tech skills used'
  - 'Insufficient word count: 185 words short of minimum (26.4% deficit)'
  - 'Beat 3 incomplete: No resolution shown; unclear if crew escapes, if painting
    is secured, if Miri confronts Victoria'
  calibration_notes: This is a strong fragment with excellent execution of heist mechanics
    and character voice, but it violates Save the Cat structure by front-loading the
    antagonist reveal. The 'Fun and Games' beat should feature a MINOR complication
    (pressure-sensitive floor), not the revelation of the primary antagonist. This
    is a structural error that cascades through the remaining beats. The tonal escalation
    constraint is partially broken because the tone shifts within Beat 1 rather than
    across beats. Word count deficit is significant but not catastrophic given the
    quality of prose. Score reflects strong execution of available content (0.85)
    tempered by structural violations and incompleteness.
