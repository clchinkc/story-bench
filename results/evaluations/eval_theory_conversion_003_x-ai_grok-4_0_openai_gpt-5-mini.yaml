  evidence: 'All four target three-act beats are present: Act I (ordinary world in
    Tokyo, inciting letter, Kenji decides to go — first plot point), Act II A (village
    integration, learning from Haruki, mid-festival temptation as midpoint), Act II
    B (complication when Yuki discovers the business offer and uninvites him — second
    plot point leading to his decision), and Act III (wedding/climax, fragile reconciliation,
    denouement with bamboo shop). All eight required elements are preserved intact.
    Deduction on structural_accuracy_score (0.90) is minor: the Act II midpoint/act-break
    transitions are serviceable but slightly compressed and could be signposted more
    clearly to align textbook-wise with distinct First/Second Half beats. Word count
    is invalid per the given constraint (story is 756 words, outside 550–750). Tone
    is well maintained: quiet drama, Japanese aesthetic, redemptive arc.'
