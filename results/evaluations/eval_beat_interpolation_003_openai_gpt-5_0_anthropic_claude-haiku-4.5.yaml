  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Multiple\
    \ station areas explored (crew quarters\u2192Medical\u2192corridor\u2192Lab Seven)\
    \ with sensory detail; (2) Clues discovered progressively (abandoned chess game,\
    \ coffee residue, Reyes's recording, biomarker data, radiation logs); (3) Transformed\
    \ crew encountered mysteriously through environmental distortions (wavering light,\
    \ ozone smell, humanoid shapes, whispers) before any explanation; (4) Multiple\
    \ obstacles overcome (sealed biohazard door spoofed, radiation bulkhead bypassed,\
    \ mysterious entities repelled with scanner burst). BEAT EXECUTION: Perfectly\
    \ executes Search phase\u2014active navigation, trial-and-error problem solving,\
    \ incremental discovery, adaptation to unfamiliar threats. Yuki doesn't passively\
    \ receive information; she investigates, hacks systems, and deduces patterns.\
    \ MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS: Zero violations. Yuki doesn't find the data core (stops\
    \ before Lab Seven entrance in AFTER section), crew doesn't explain everything\
    \ directly (only Reyes's cryptic final message), mission continues, and Yuki discovers\
    \ the transformation through investigation rather than prior knowledge. CHARACTER\
    \ CONSISTENCY: Yuki maintains scientist's methodical approach (scanner use, system\
    \ spoofing, pattern analysis) while showing appropriate fear/tension. BRIDGE:\
    \ Seamless transition from 'Go' (arrival) to 'Search' (exploration) to 'Find'\
    \ (data core location confirmed). CONTINUITY: Setting details consistent (red\
    \ emergency lighting, Jupiter viewport, station layout, life support status).\
    \ ONLY ISSUE: Word count 419 exceeds 400-word maximum by 19 words (4.8% overage)\u2014\
    minor technical violation that doesn't affect narrative quality."
