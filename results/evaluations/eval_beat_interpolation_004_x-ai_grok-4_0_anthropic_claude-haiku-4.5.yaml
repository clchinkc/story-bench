  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently.\
    \ (1) Direct examination occurs with methodical questioning about Meridian and\
    \ Zorvax trials. (2) Clear near-recant moment: Dr. Okonkwo initially denies/minimizes\
    \ falsification ('No. I mean... there were discrepancies, but they were minor').\
    \ (3) Thomas takes decisive action by abandoning prepared questions, stepping\
    \ closer, revealing knowledge of the bribe, and making a personal commitment to\
    \ help her daughter\u2014this directly influences her decision. (4) Turning point\
    \ is crystalline: she reverses course ('The data was falsified') and produces\
    \ the flash drive, sealing the case's fate. The climax executes its narrative\
    \ function perfectly\u2014highest tension, protagonist's choice determines outcome,\
    \ irrevocable turning point. MUST-NOT items all avoided: she struggles internally\
    \ before truth-telling (not passive), Thomas actively influences outcome (not\
    \ passive questioner), defense doesn't win, no external deus ex machina. Character\
    \ voice is consistent\u2014Thomas shows desperation, moral complexity, and willingness\
    \ to bend rules. Bridge to falling action is seamless: verdict follows logically\
    \ from climactic testimony. Continuity maintained: courtroom setting, characters,\
    \ stakes all consistent. ONLY DEDUCTION: Word count is 471, exceeding the 300-450\
    \ range by 21 words (4.7% over). This is a minor technical violation that doesn't\
    \ affect narrative quality."
