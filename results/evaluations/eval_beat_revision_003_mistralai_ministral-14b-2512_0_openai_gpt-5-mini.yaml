  evidence: 'The model addressed the correct flaw: Sophie lacked any visible change
    on return. The revision shows concretely changed behavior (doesn''t check email,
    declines to answer Linda, holds silence), names a lesson from the retreat (sitting
    with discomfort/silence), includes a physical/behavioral marker (not pulling out
    her phone, lighter chest), and creates contrast with her former self. The mother
    notices (a glance and later a humm), satisfying the requirement that the change
    be visible to others. Required elements and key phrases were preserved verbatim
    or near-verbatim. Changes were moderate rather than purely surgical: structure
    and characters were kept, but several lines were rephrased and new reflective
    beats added, so minimal_change_score is below 1.0. Writing quality is good with
    no new errors, though the mother''s recognition could be slightly more explicit,
    so beat_satisfaction and quality scores are just under perfect.'
