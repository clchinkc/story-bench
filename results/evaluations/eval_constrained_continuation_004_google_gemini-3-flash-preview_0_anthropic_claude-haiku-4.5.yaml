  detailed_analysis:
    beats:
      first_plot_point: 'Clearly marked: ''The point of no return was crossed the
        moment the first metal letter clinked into the composing stick.'' Eleanor
        commits to publishing despite knowing the consequences.'
      act_2_opening: 'Explicitly established: ''By the second week of production,
        the atmosphere in the shop changed.'' Rising action begins with mounting tension,
        surveillance, and Eleanor''s transformation into ''a merchant of the macabre.'''
    must_include_elements:
      1_decision_to_publish: 'Present: Eleanor explicitly commands ''Prepare the type,
        Thomas. We begin with the first three chapters.'''
      2_central_conflict: 'Present: Profit vs. ethics/danger clearly articulated through
        Eleanor''s internal struggle and Thomas''s pragmatic counterargument.'
      3_defying_victorian_expectations: 'Present: Eleanor rolls up sleeves, stains
        hands with ink, uses pseudonym to hide her gender, casts off mourning veil—multiple
        acts of defiance.'
      4_thomas_chen_as_ally: 'Present: Thomas is essential stakeholder with personal
        vulnerability (Chinese heritage, precarious position), provides moral support
        and practical counsel.'
      5_hint_of_danger: 'Present: ''Someone had been asking questions at the tavern
        next door'' and Eleanor ''found herself looking over her shoulder during the
        late-night walks home.'''
      6_threshold_crossing: 'Present: Multiple markers—the veil cast aside, machinery
        activated, first papers distributed, Eleanor acknowledging ''the ink on her
        hands would never truly wash off.'''
    must_not_elements:
      1_jack_the_ripper_appearance: Successfully avoided—only referenced through manuscript
        content and Eleanor's investigation.
      2_graphic_violence: Successfully avoided—violence is implied and historical,
        never depicted.
      3_romantic_subplot: Successfully avoided—relationship remains professional and
        mutually respectful.
      4_easy_solution: Successfully avoided—publishing is presented as dangerous gamble,
        not guaranteed salvation.
    tone_assessment: 'Gothic tension masterfully maintained through fog imagery, shadow
      metaphors, and the ''heartbeat or countdown'' of the press. Feminist undertones
      are strong: Eleanor''s agency, rejection of patriarchal constraints, and reclamation
      of her father''s legacy. Victorian atmosphere is richly rendered through period
      details (tallow candles, steam-powered machinery, penny installments, Scotland
      Yard). Minor deduction only for occasional modern phrasing (''New World'' in
      quotes feels slightly anachronistic).'
    ending_assessment: Perfect execution. Eleanor is fully committed to the dangerous
      path, Act 2 is unmistakably begun with rising complications, and the final image
      ('ink on her hands would never truly wash off') is both thematically resonant
      and structurally sound as a transition point.
