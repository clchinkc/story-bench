  evidence: All four required elements are present (Marcus introduced by name; he
    gives a satchel/compass and practical guidance; Elena's doubt shifts toward reluctant
    acceptance; her librarian skills are explicitly referenced). No forbidden items
    appear (no instant overconfidence, no mentor solving problems/coming along, no
    forest location, no sudden magic). Character voices and scene continuity are consistent
    with the preceding and following beats, so no deductions were made.
