  evidence: 'All four required elements present and well-executed: (1) Marcus introduced
    as wise mentor figure with clear authority (''topography of scars,'' ''bright
    eyes,'' knowledge of magic); (2) Practical wisdom provided through reframing librarian
    skills as assets (''Precise language, attention to detail, historical context'')
    and tools given (compass, satchel); (3) Elena''s doubt shifts to reluctant acceptance
    (''refusal still sat on her tongue, but beneath it, a terrible, curious question
    had begun to form''); (4) Librarian skills explicitly validated as potentially
    useful for reading the forest. All must-not violations avoided: Elena remains
    doubtful and hesitant, Marcus explicitly refuses to accompany her, setting remains
    in the shop (not forest), no magical powers discovered. Character voice consistent
    throughout—Elena''s skepticism and Marcus''s measured wisdom maintained. Bridge
    seamless: connects directly from grandmother''s ghost scene to Marcus''s shop,
    explains map''s reappearance, and leads naturally to threshold crossing. Continuity
    perfect: map, satchel, compass all referenced consistently; Elena''s emotional
    state progresses logically from refusal to reluctant curiosity.'
