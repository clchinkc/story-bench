  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas
    (medical bay, lab section, command center), finds clues (personal effects, ''Dimensional
    Bridge Hypothesis'', half-written log), encounters transformed crew as mysterious
    shimmers, and faces/overcomes obstacles (pursuit, failing instrumentation) to
    continue. None of the forbidden items occur (no immediate data core discovery
    or full explanation, she doesn''t abandon the mission, and she didn''t already
    know about the transformation). Character actions and voice are consistent and
    the passage cleanly bridges to the subsequent ''Find'' beat with maintained setting
    continuity.'
