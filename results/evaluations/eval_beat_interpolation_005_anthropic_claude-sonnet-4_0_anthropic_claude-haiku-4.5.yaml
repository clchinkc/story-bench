  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently.
    (1) Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability—the anniversary of his career-ending
    injury and the truth about the accident (he saved a child''s life, not recklessly
    driving). (2) Relationship shifts from professional to personal—she moves from
    ''personal chef'' role to intimate emotional support, crossing professional boundaries
    intentionally. (3) Shared moment of genuine connection—the 2am kitchen scene with
    tea, tortilla, and the fingertip touch creates authentic intimacy. (4) Maya''s
    commitment deepens beyond contract—she explicitly states ''Because you matter
    to me'' and recognizes ''she was no longer here just for her grandmother''s restaurant.''
    The beat perfectly executes the narrative function: Alejandro moves from closed-off
    recluse to vulnerable, Maya moves from transactional employee to emotionally invested
    partner. Stakes are raised (emotional vulnerability, contract risk). MUST-NOT
    ITEMS: All avoided. They are not already in love (connection is nascent). Maya
    doesn''t leave or breach contract (she commits further). The photograph isn''t
    taken during this scene (correctly placed in AFTER beat). Alejandro''s walls lower
    completely during the scene. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Both characters behave authentically—Alejandro''s
    raw grief and Maya''s compassionate, boundary-crossing response are consistent
    with their established arcs. BRIDGE: Seamlessly connects BEFORE (contract signing,
    hidden motivation) to AFTER (photograph scandal, forced separation). CONTINUITY:
    Kitchen setting maintained, timeline logical (2am), emotional progression clear.'
