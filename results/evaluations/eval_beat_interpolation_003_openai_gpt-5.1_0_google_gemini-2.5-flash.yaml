  evidence: 'The output successfully includes all required elements: Yuki explores
    multiple areas (quarters, med bay, hydroponics, operations), discovers clues (unmade
    bunks, frozen coffee, Reyes''s log, notes on plants, encrypted orders), encounters
    transformed crew members (ripple in air, distortion field, gravitational blips),
    and overcomes a challenge (escaping the med bay entity, navigating the station).
    It avoids all ''must not'' items, particularly not finding the core or understanding
    everything immediately. The narrative clearly executes the ''Search'' beat by
    showing Yuki actively investigating and facing obstacles. Character and continuity
    are consistent, and it bridges well to the ''Find'' beat by setting up the search
    for Lab Seven and the data core.'
