  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated
    The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis. It diagnosed
    all four actual flaws: (1) lack of confrontation with deepest fear, (2) absence
    of a death moment, (3) no transformation, (4) victory through persistence rather
    than insight. FLAW CORRECTION: Fully addressed. The revision introduces: (1) Dragon
    exploiting Kira''s guilt over brother''s death—her actual psychological fear,
    not just external threat; (2) Clear death moment when Kira drops her sword and
    surrenders, accepting defeat; (3) Transformation occurs through acceptance—she
    moves from self-hatred to purposeful action despite guilt; (4) Victory comes from
    new understanding (''victory wasn''t erasing her guilt, but fighting despite it'')
    rather than just persistence. PRESERVATION: All 4 required phrases present: ''Kira
    faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm'' (opening), ''The creature was massive—twenty
    feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes'' (intact), ''You cannot defeat me, child,''
    the dragon rumbled'' (modified slightly with added psychological content but core
    phrase preserved), ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar'' (ending).
    All 4 story elements preserved: Shadow Dragon antagonist, Kira protagonist with
    sword, brother''s death reference, victorious outcome. MINIMAL CHANGES: Approximately
    75% of original structure retained. The first two sentences are identical. The
    dragon''s dialogue is expanded but not replaced. The battle sequence is restructured
    to emphasize psychological rather than physical struggle, but the three-knockdowns-three-rises
    pattern echoes the original. The ending maintains the victory and sword retrieval.
    Changes are surgical rather than wholesale—focused on internalization of conflict.
    QUALITY: Writing is professional, no new errors introduced. Prose flows naturally.
    The metaphor of ''dragon as self-hatred made manifest'' is thematically coherent.
    Dialogue feels authentic. One minor note: ''earth-shaking'' should be ''earth-shaking''
    (already correct in revision). The emotional arc is compelling and the transformation
    feels earned.'
