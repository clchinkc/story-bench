  evidence: 'All four required elements present: (1) Marcus introduced as wise mentor
    figure with distinctive characterization (sharp angles, weathered leather, silver-streaked
    hair); (2) Practical wisdom delivered through the magnifying glass demonstration
    and Dewey Decimal System metaphor, plus tangible tools provided (compass, satchel,
    supplies); (3) Elena''s doubt shifts to reluctant acceptance—she ''bristled''
    but ''couldn''t look away,'' ends with ''flicker of something like purpose'' rather
    than confidence; (4) Librarian skills reframed as valuable through pattern recognition
    and listening abilities. All must-not violations avoided: Elena remains doubtful
    (''scoffed''), Marcus explicitly does not accompany her (''parting gift''), Elena
    is still in village/shop setting (not forest), no magical powers discovered. Character
    voice consistent—Elena''s skepticism and librarian identity maintained throughout.
    Bridge seamless: BEFORE ends with her walking out refusing; GENERATED shows her
    arriving at Marcus''s shop despite her resolve, establishing internal conflict.
    AFTER references Marcus''s parting words and gifts, confirming mentor relationship
    established. Setting continuity perfect: village → shop → forest edge progression
    logical. Word count 275 falls within 200-350 range.'
