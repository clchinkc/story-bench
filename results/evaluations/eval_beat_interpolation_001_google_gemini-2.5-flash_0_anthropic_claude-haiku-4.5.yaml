  evidence: "All four required elements present: (1) Marcus introduced as wise mentor\
    \ figure with 'weary wisdom of too many journeys'; (2) Practical wisdom provided\
    \ ('map is organized knowledge,' 'journey is a story') and tangible tools gifted\
    \ (satchel, brass compass); (3) Elena's doubt shifts from absolute refusal ('I\
    \ told it no') to reluctant acceptance ('words had chipped away at her absolute\
    \ refusal'); (4) Librarian skills reframed as assets ('organize knowledge,' 'catalog').\
    \ All must-not violations avoided: Elena remains doubtful ('still filled her with\
    \ dread'), Marcus explicitly does not accompany her ('turning back to his telescope'),\
    \ setting remains at curiosity shop (not forest), no magical powers discovered.\
    \ Character voice perfectly consistent\u2014Elena maintains her self-deprecating,\
    \ practical tone while showing subtle vulnerability. Bridge seamless: connects\
    \ directly to 'Refusal' beat (Elena's rejection) and leads naturally to 'Crossing\
    \ the Threshold' beat (compass, satchel, forest approach). Continuity perfect:\
    \ grandmother's ghost from prior beat not contradicted, village location maintained,\
    \ all details align with established world."
