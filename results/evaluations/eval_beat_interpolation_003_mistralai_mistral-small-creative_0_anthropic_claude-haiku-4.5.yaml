  evidence: 'All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Multiple station
    areas explored (crew quarters, medical bay, hydroponics bay, lab wing) with environmental
    details; (2) Clues discovered progressively (warm coffee cup, medical logs with
    cryptic notes about ''Subject 47'' and neural resonance, withered plants); (3)
    Transformed crew encountered as mysterious, flickering entities with void eyes—their
    nature remains ambiguous and threatening; (4) Clear obstacles overcome (scanner
    dies, physical stumble, navigating past dozens of transformed figures). All must-not
    items avoided: data core not found yet (cliffhanger ending), crew doesn''t explain
    themselves (only cryptic whispers), Yuki persists despite fear, and she arrives
    without prior knowledge of transformation. Character voice remains consistent—scientific
    training overriding terror, methodical observation despite horror. Bridge seamless:
    BEFORE establishes mystery and silence; SEARCH shows active investigation with
    escalating discovery and danger; AFTER setup (partial) shows she''s reached the
    data core location. Setting continuity perfect: station details, emergency lighting,
    and spatial geography maintained throughout. The narrative executes the Search
    beat''s core function: struggle through an unfamiliar environment with incremental
    discoveries and mounting obstacles, not immediate resolution.'
