  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Sarah considers recanting, discusses
    official channels with Marcus, wrestles with duty vs. family, and a decisive conversation/moment
    (Marcus''s departure and his hand on her shoulder) tips her toward a third option.
    No forbidden elements appear (no immediate rogue decision without debate, no one
    else makes the choice, she hasn''t resigned here, and there''s no direct confrontation
    with Marchetti). Tone and continuity match the BEFORE material and it cleanly
    leads into the Break Into Two.'
