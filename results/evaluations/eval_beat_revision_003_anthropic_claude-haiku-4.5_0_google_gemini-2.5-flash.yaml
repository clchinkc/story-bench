  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie not showing
    change upon return. It introduced a clear moment of pause and a different response
    to work stress, directly contrasting her old behavior. Her mother notices the
    change, and Sophie articulates her new perspective. The changes were surgical,
    adding new dialogue and internal monologue while retaining the original structure
    and key elements.
