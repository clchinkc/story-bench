  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas
    (Crew Quarters, Mess Hall, Science Wing), discovers clues (unmade beds, open tablets,
    half-finished game implying sudden departure), encounters transformed crew as
    shimmering entities, and overcomes an obstacle (manual override of locked blast
    doors). The passage functions clearly as the ''Search'' beat—investigation, escalating
    danger, and incremental progress—without violating any must-not conditions. Character
    behavior and station continuity remain consistent throughout.'
