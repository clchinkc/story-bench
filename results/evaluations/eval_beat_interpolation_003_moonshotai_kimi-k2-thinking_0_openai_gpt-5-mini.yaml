  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: multiple locations explored (Crew
    Quarters B, medical bay, corridors, Lab Seven), clues discovered (unauthorized
    ''human trials'' log, quantum decay, non-baryonic traces), mysterious encounters
    with transformed crew (flickering silhouettes, shimmer), and an obstacle overcome
    (manual override/recalibration to stop blast doors). None of the forbidden items
    occur: the data core is not immediately found, the transformed crew do not directly
    explain events (only partial, cryptic echo from Reyes), Yuki does not decide to
    leave, and she did not know about the dimensional transformation beforehand. Setting
    and character behavior remain consistent, and the scene cleanly bridges into the
    next beat (''Find'').'
