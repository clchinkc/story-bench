  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly marked: You (library
    fortress/ghost existence), Need (voice/courage), Go (stepping into humid reality),
    Search (learning rhythm with Bernard), Find (breakthrough about listening as courage),
    Take (town hall presentation with trembling hands), Return (library feels different,
    Bernard''s funeral), Change (journalism school, speaking her truth). All 8 core
    elements preserved: Zoe as protagonist, library setting, oral history program,
    Ms. Okafor as initiator, Bernard Park as key relationship, social anxiety threaded
    throughout, town hall presentation climax, Bernard''s death and journalism school
    ending. Tone is consistently gentle and intimate with emotional authenticity—particularly
    strong in phrases like ''live wire,'' ''salemate of polite trivia,'' and ''exist
    out loud.'' Minor deduction (0.05) on structural accuracy: the ''Take'' beat could
    be slightly more explicit about the price/cost beyond emotional vulnerability—the
    text emphasizes courage but could sharpen the sacrifice element. Minor tone deduction
    (0.05): one phrase (''roar she finally didn''t want to hide from'') edges slightly
    toward melodrama rather than maintaining the understated intimacy of the rest.
    Overall exceptional execution of conversion.'
