  evidence: 'All four required elements appear: Maya uncovers Alejandro''s vulnerability,
    their relationship shifts from professional to personal, a shared cooking moment
    creates genuine connection, and Maya commits emotionally beyond the contract.
    The scene clearly performs the midpoint ''point of commitment.'' None of the prohibited
    items are present. The only issue is the word count (496 words), which falls outside
    the 300–450 range; otherwise continuity and character consistency are strong.
    Bridge scored 0.9 because the commitment is clear though a touch swift in its
    realization.'
