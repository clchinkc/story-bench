  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability
    (his confession about the injury and not eating sofrito), their relationship clearly
    shifts from professional to personal (emotional confession and his wish she not
    leave), a shared moment creates genuine connection (cooking, eating, wrist squeeze),
    and Maya makes a choice deepening commitment (''Neither do I''). None of the forbidden
    items occur (no pre-existing declared love or over-intimacy, no decision to leave,
    no photo taken here, Alejandro opens up). Character behavior and setting remain
    consistent with prior material, and the scene functions well as the Act 2 midpoint/point
    of commitment.'
