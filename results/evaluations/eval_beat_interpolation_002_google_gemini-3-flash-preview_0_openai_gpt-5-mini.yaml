  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Sarah weighs recanting, discusses
    official channels with Marcus, wrestles duty vs. sister, and has a clear tipping
    moment (spotting the sedan and internal realization) that pushes her toward action.
    Deductions: beat_execution_score slightly reduced (0.9) because her decision to
    leave is fairly swift—while still clearly a product of the debate, it verges on
    early commitment. Bridge_score slightly reduced (0.9) because the scene sets up
    the Break into Two very well but stops short of the formal resignation, so the
    transition is implied rather than shown. No must-not violations or continuity/character
    problems. Word count flagged invalid per the provided range.'
