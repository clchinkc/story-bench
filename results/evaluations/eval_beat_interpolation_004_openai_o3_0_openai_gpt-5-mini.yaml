  evidence: 'All four required elements are clearly present: direct examination, a
    believable near-recant, a decisive action by Thomas that influences Dr. Okonkwo,
    and the turning point where the truth is revealed. None of the prohibited items
    occur (no simple, effortless confession, Thomas is not passive, defense does not
    prevail, and no deus ex machina appears). Character behavior and setting are consistent
    with prior and subsequent beats, so no deductions were necessary.'
