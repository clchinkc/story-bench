  evidence: 'All eight Dan Harmon beats are present: comfort zone (library), need
    (missing her own voice), go (joins oral-history program), search (awkward interviews,
    learning), find (breakthrough with Bernard/trust and listening), take (town-hall
    presentation and taking responsibility), return (summer ends, continues work,
    returns to ordinary life), change (applies to journalism, speaks at funeral).
    All eight required elements are preserved (Zoe, library/program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard
    Park, Zoe''s social anxiety, town hall, Bernard''s death, journalism application).
    I deducted slightly on structural_accuracy_score because the ''Take'' beat (paying
    a price) is present but not strongly framed as a clear sacrifice or cost—it''s
    more an emotional responsibility and exposure than an explicit price—otherwise
    the structure maps very cleanly and the gentle, intimate tone is fully maintained.'
