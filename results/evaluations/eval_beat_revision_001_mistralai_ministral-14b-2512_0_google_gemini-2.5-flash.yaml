  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw that the original
    segment treated The Ordeal as a mere boss battle rather than a transformative
    crisis. It successfully integrated Kira's guilt over her brother's death as her
    deepest fear, creating a 'death' moment where she is overwhelmed by grief and
    self-blame, and a subsequent rebirth/transformation where she gains new understanding
    about her fear. The victory comes from this internal shift, not just persistence.
    The required phrases were all preserved, and the core structure of the fight was
    maintained, though significant new internal monologue and dragon dialogue were
    added to achieve the fix, making it more than 'minimal surgical edits' but not
    a complete rewrite.
