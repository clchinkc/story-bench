  - 'Chekhov''s Gun: the specific skill/knowledge demonstrated in Beat 1 (e.g., her
    servant disguise/pidgin performance) is not clearly the essential means by which
    she overcomes the final obstacle in Beat 3; instead the pivotal document-forgery
    action occurs in Beat 2 rather than being the through-line from Beat 1 to Beat
    3.'
