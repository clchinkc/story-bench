  evidence: 'All eight Dan Harmon beats are present and presented in clear sequence:
    You (library comfort), Need (desire to connect), Go (accepting the interview),
    Search (learning to interview), Find (breakthrough with Bernard), Take (town-hall
    presentation/exposure), Return (back to library, funeral), Change (applying to
    journalism, newfound confidence). All eight required story elements are retained:
    Zoe, library/oral-history program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard Park, Zoe''s social anxiety,
    town-hall presentation, Bernard''s death, and the journalism-ending. Tone is gentle
    and intimate throughout. No deductions made.'
