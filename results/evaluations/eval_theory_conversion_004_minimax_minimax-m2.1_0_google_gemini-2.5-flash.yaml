  evidence: The 'Go' beat is a bit stretched across the initial interviews rather
    than a single clear 'crossing the threshold' moment, but it's still present. The
    'Take' beat (paying the price) is well-represented by the town hall presentation.
    All other beats are clearly present and well-executed. All 8 elements are preserved.
    The word count is slightly under the requested range.
