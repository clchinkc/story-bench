  analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      search: Present - Jin navigates Prom Station, learns unspoken rules, discovers
        competing factions and hidden hierarchies through Kiran's guidance
      find: Present - Jin discovers the suppressed carbon capture technology is in
        Collective's possession; finds the platform/safety he sought
      take: Present - Jin accepts the broadcast deal, paying the price of his independence
        and becoming an instrument of the Collective's agenda
    must_include_analysis:
      1_unfamiliar_culture: Excellent - Detailed navigation of station politics, faction
        hierarchies, maintenance tunnels, unspoken rules
      2_mentor_figure: Excellent - Kiran serves as guide, explaining systems, revealing
        hidden truths, though with manipulative intent
      3_unexpected_discovery: Excellent - The revelation that Collective possessed
        the technology all along, hidden for years
      4_finds_what_wanted: Excellent - Jin gains platform, safety, and means to continue
        his fight against the Council
      5_action_with_cost: Excellent - Jin agrees to broadcast, explicitly recognizing
        the cost to his independence and identity
      6_moral_compromise: 'Excellent - Central tension: using humanitarian technology
        as political leverage; Jin''s internal conflict about becoming a symbol/instrument'
    must_not_analysis:
      1_easy_integration: Successfully avoided - Jin struggles with suspicion, confusion,
        moral qualms; integration is fraught
      2_earth_family_contact: Successfully avoided - No family communication or relationships
        depicted
      3_violence_weapons: Successfully avoided - Conflict is entirely political and
        psychological
      4_complete_resolution: Successfully avoided - Conspiracy remains active; broadcast
        is planned but not executed; larger plot unresolved
    tone_analysis: Contemplative and politically charged tone maintained throughout.
      Personal stakes (Jin's identity, independence) are woven through larger conflict
      (climate conspiracy, Collective politics). Introspective moments balance political
      exposition. Minor deduction only for occasional exposition-heavy dialogue.
    ending_analysis: Perfect execution of 'Take' beat. Jin gains platform and safety
      but pays price of independence and self-recognition. Final image ('Jin wondered
      if he would ever recognize himself in the mirror again') crystallizes the moral
      cost. Ends precisely at the moment of commitment with consequences acknowledged.
    strengths:
    - All three required beats present and well-executed
    - All six must-include elements seamlessly integrated
    - Sophisticated moral complexity—no easy answers
    - Strong character voice and internal conflict
    - Excellent pacing and tension escalation
    - Kiran is a compelling, morally ambiguous mentor
    - Ending lands with emotional and thematic weight
    weaknesses:
    - Word count exceeds limit by 84 words (11% over)
    - 'Minor: One instance of non-English character (''功能性'' appears to be encoding
      error, should be ''functional'')'
    - Could tighten exposition in middle section to meet word count
  failed_constraints:
  - 'word_count_exceeds_maximum: 834 words vs 750 limit (84 words over)'
error: null
