  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The narrative clearly
    functions as an Act 2 Midpoint, shifting the relationship and commitment. All
    'must not' items were successfully avoided. Character voices and continuity are
    strong. The bridge between the beats is seamless, setting up the 'All Is Lost'
    moment effectively.
