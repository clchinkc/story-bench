  evidence: "The revision targeted the correct flaw: it turns the segment into a proper\
    \ All Is Lost beat by removing the protagonist's remaining options and support.\
    \ Specific changes: fundraiser is reported as coming up short, the grant is denied,\
    \ the board dissolves, Denise accepts a job and leaves, and Marcus receives divorce\
    \ papers\u2014creating isolation and a 'whiff of death' (the collapse of his life's\
    \ work and identity). These address points 1\u20135 from the required fix. Minor\
    \ weakness: the fundraiser is described as bringing in \"half\" the needed amount\
    \ rather than being utterly impossible, which leaves a faint logical remnant of\
    \ hope; nonetheless, the combined losses effectively eliminate viable options.\
    \ The edit preserved all required phrases and core elements, and while it expands\
    \ the original text substantially to deliver the beat, it remains a targeted revision\
    \ rather than a complete rewrite."
