  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Exposition establishes Samira''s 15-year reputation and methodical world before
    the anomaly shatters it. Rising Action escalates through containment, patient
    influx, and mounting obstacles (bureaucracy, doubt, viral adaptation). Climax
    peaks with the Nexus confrontation and revelation of bioweapon. Falling Action
    shows press conference and public cure release with immediate chaos. Denouement
    provides new equilibrium 6 weeks later with Samira''s sacrifice and peace. All
    6 core elements preserved: Samira (protagonist), engineered virus, Raj (loyal
    support), Nexus (antagonist), public cure release, career sacrifice. Tone maintains
    medical thriller tension throughout with ethical weight evident in Samira''s internal
    conflicts and final choice. DEDUCTIONS: Word count is 709, exceeding the 500-700
    range by 9 words (minor violation, -0.05 from structural_accuracy). The conversion
    adds substantial narrative depth (employer discovery, bioweapon revelation, press
    conference details) that enriches the original but slightly inflates length. Structural
    accuracy remains high because the 5-beat framework is unmistakably present and
    properly sequenced. Tone is strong but could be marginally tighter in places (some
    descriptive passages like ''web of protocols'' are slightly purple prose, -0.1
    from tone). Overall execution is professional and demonstrates clear understanding
    of Freytag''s Pyramid as distinct from 3-act structure.'
