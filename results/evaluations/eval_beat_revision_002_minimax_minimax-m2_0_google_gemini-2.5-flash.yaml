  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment did not convey
    a true 'All Is Lost' moment. It addressed the lack of complete failure, the intact
    support system, and the absence of a 'whiff of death'. The revision introduces
    the failure of the grant, the resignation of board members (isolating Marcus),
    and a significant personal loss (wife's death), effectively removing all options
    and support. The changes were surgical, primarily adding new dialogue and internal
    monologue to achieve the desired effect, while preserving the core of the original
    text.
