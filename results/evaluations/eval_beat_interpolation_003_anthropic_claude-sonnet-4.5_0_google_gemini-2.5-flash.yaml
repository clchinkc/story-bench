  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas (quarters,
    medbay), discovers clues (notes, coffee cup), encounters transformed crew (shimmers),
    and overcomes a challenge (interpreting shimmers'' intent). The beat clearly executes
    the ''Search'' function by having Yuki actively investigate and adapt. No ''must
    not'' items were violated. Yuki''s scientific and cautious character is consistent.
    The transition from ''Go'' to ''Search'' and ''Search'' to ''Find'' is seamless
    and logical, maintaining continuity.'
