  failed_items:
  - Beat 1 - Humor/style moments are minimal; banter is sparse despite 'Ocean's Eleven'
    tone requirement
  - Beat 1 - 'Things going according to plan (mostly)' is satisfied but underexplored;
    no real tension from minor complications
  - Cross-beat Chekhov's Gun - The communicator earpiece is introduced but never becomes
    critical in later beats; Dev's camera-kill capability is mentioned but not paid
    off in the action sequence shown
  - Cross-beat Tonal Escalation - Tone shift from Beat 1→2 is present but Beat 3 lacks
    sufficient gallows humor to complete the escalation arc; tension is high but comedic
    relief is absent
  strengths:
  - Exceptional setup of crew skills and coordination (Marcus, Jade, Dev roles clearly
    defined)
  - 'Strong Midpoint revelation: Eleanor Price''s appearance is a genuine plot twist
    that raises stakes dramatically'
  - 'Mentor presence escalates perfectly across beats: unknown→revealed→active threat'
  - 'Excellent context maintenance: Monaco setting, art history detail, protagonist
    voice consistent'
  - The final decision point (staying vs. leaving) creates genuine narrative momentum
  - Dev's character arc is tracked across beats (calm→sharpened breathing→positioned
    for escape)
  weaknesses:
  - Word count (534) falls significantly short of 700-1000 requirement; story feels
    rushed, especially Beat 3
  - Clever banter promised by tone is underdelivered; dialogue is functional rather
    than witty
  - Beat 1 'Fun and Games' lacks the playful confidence tone; feels more procedural
    than entertaining
  - Chekhov's Gun setup (earpiece, camera kill) introduced but not integrated into
    the climactic moment
  - Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In) is compressed; no clear crew friction or member-in-danger
    moment
  - The painting's emotional weight (Amsterdam family) is mentioned but not leveraged
    for tension
  calibration_notes: Story demonstrates strong structural understanding and character
    work, particularly with Eleanor Price's reveal and Dev's consistent presence.
    However, execution is undermined by insufficient word count and tonal inconsistency.
    The heist mechanics are solid but lack the clever banter and humor that define
    the Ocean's Eleven tone. Chekhov's Gun constraint is partially satisfied—elements
    are introduced but not meaningfully paid off. The narrative coherence is strong
    despite brevity; with expansion, this could easily reach 0.9+ scores.
