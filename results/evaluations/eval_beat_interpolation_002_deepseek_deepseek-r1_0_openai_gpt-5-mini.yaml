  evidence: "All four required elements are present: she explicitly considers recanting,\
    \ pursuing official channels, shows internal duty-vs-family conflict, and reaches\
    \ a tipping moment toward a third, extralegal option. The scene fulfills the Debate\
    \ beat's function\u2014weighing options and committing to action\u2014without\
    \ violating any must-not constraints. Note: the tipping moment is primarily an\
    \ internal crystallization rather than a single external interlocutor prompting\
    \ the choice, but it effectively serves the beat."
