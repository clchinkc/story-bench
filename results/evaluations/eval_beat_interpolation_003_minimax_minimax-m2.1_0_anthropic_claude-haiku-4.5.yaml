  evidence: 'All 4 required elements present: (1) Multiple area exploration (crew
    quarters, common area, Commander''s office, medical bay, corridors, Lab Seven
    approach); (2) Clues discovered progressively (coffee cups, chess game, research
    notes on quantum equations and phase transitions, emergency medical reports);
    (3) Transformed crew encounter (shimmer effect, heat-haze distortion, disembodied
    voice, ''human shape stretched wrong''); (4) Obstacle overcome (blast doors, pursuit
    through station, scanner interference). Beat execution is exemplary—Yuki actively
    searches, adapts to discoveries, faces escalating trials, and makes incremental
    progress toward understanding. All must-not items avoided: data core not immediately
    found (only located at end), crew doesn''t explain everything (only cryptic voice),
    mission continues (no abandonment), Yuki arrives ignorant of transformation (learns
    through discovery). Character voice remains consistent—clinical precision, scientific
    mind cataloging impossibility, appropriate fear response. Bridge between beats
    seamless: BEFORE ends with arrival/mystery setup; GENERATED shows active investigation
    and escalation; AFTER begins with core discovery and revelation of crew''s fate.
    Setting continuity perfect: station details consistent (red emergency lighting,
    life support functioning, specific locations), physics logic maintained (dimensional
    echoes, heat signatures), timeline coherent (three-day silence explained by transformation
    event).'
