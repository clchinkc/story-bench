  evidence: All 12 Campbell beats appear in clear sequence (Ordinary World through
    Return with Elixir). All 7 required elements are retained (Maya, pottery, grandmother,
    shrine journey, dried spring, surrender theme, transformation). Structural score
    is slightly reduced because the Mentor figure is represented indirectly (journal/pendant
    and memory rather than a living guide) and the Tests/Allies/Enemies beat is compressed
    into a brief passage; otherwise sequencing and functions are faithful. Tone is
    quiet, meditative, and transformative throughout. Word count falls outside the
    requested 600–800 range.
