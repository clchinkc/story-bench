  evidence: 'The model explicitly responded ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' and provided a
    clear explanation mapping the segment to the Dark Night of the Soul criteria:
    isolation (dark apartment, unanswered brother), major defeat (gallery closure),
    genuine despair and reflection (failed promise, hospice memory), no premature
    solutions, and a ''whiff of death'' (mother''s passing and painting). The response
    avoided suggesting any changes and justified why the beat is effective.'
