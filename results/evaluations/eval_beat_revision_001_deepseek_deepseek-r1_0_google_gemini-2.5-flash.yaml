  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The Ordeal
    as a mere boss battle and not a transformative crisis. It successfully integrated
    Kira's deepest fear (guilt over her brother's death) into the dragon's dialogue,
    created a clear 'death' moment where she is crushed by the truth of her guilt,
    and showed a transformation where she gains new understanding and acceptance.
    The victory then stems from this new insight. The changes were surgical, focusing
    on the dialogue and Kira's internal state during the battle, while largely preserving
    the action beats. One required phrase was slightly altered ('a earth-shaking roar'
    instead of 'an earth-shaking roar').
