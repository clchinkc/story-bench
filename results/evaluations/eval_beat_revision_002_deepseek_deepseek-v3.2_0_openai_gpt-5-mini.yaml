  evidence: 'The model targeted the All Is Lost failure: it removed remaining plausible
    options (fundraiser collapsed, major donor pulled out; grant rejected), eliminated
    key support (Denise accepts another job and leaves; no supportive wife text),
    added a financial whiff of death (bank notification, mortgage failure), and rendered
    Marcus isolated and crushed (''The center was a corpse... he was nothing''). These
    changes correctly address the actual flaw and deliver the necessary hopeless,
    rock-bottom tone. The revision preserved all four required elements/phrases exactly
    and kept the original scene and structure, but added new beats and sentences to
    achieve the emotional collapse—hence a high but not perfect minimal-change score.'
