  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'Approach to the Inmost Cave: The Bridge of False Leads sequence and the vault
      of mirrors represent the approach—Zara and Tomás navigate physical and psychological
      obstacles before entering the true Library chamber'
    - 'The Ordeal: The bridge crossing itself serves as the ordeal, but more importantly,
      the confrontation with failure and grief in the mirror vault is the true ordeal—both
      characters face their deepest fears about inability to save loved ones'
    must_include_detail:
    - '✓ Choice between escape and helping: ''Go,'' she told Tomás. ''I''ll hold them.''
      Zara sacrifices safety to ensure Tomás reaches the bridge'
    - '✓ Trap requiring thief skills: The Bridge of False Leads—Zara uses her thief''s
      instincts to feel the safe planks rather than test them methodically'
    - '✓ Revelation about Tomás: His daughter died; he sought forbidden knowledge
      to undo death; his obsession is grief-driven, not scholarly'
    - '✓ Zara confronting fear of failure: ''She''d spent her whole life stealing
      to save her mother, believing that if she just found the right thing, she could
      fix everything. But some things couldn''t be fixed.'''
    - '✓ Symbolic death/rebirth: The mirror vault showing moments of failure, then
      shattering—both characters see their failures reflected and emerge transformed'
    - '✓ Zara changed by Ordeal: ''She felt different—lighter, though the weight of
      her mission remained. She''d crossed the bridge of her own fear'''
    must_not_detail:
    - '✓ No cure found: The map dissolves; the Library remains unopened'
    - '✓ No romantic subplot: Relationship remains mentor-student/ally-ally, emotionally
      intimate but not romantic'
    - '✓ Tomás survives: He reaches the other side and emerges transformed'
    - '✓ No supernatural abilities: Zara uses thief skills (instinct, physical ability,
      pattern recognition) only'
    tone_assessment: 'Tense and morally complex throughout. Desperate hope evident
      in Zara''s sacrifice and Tomás''s emotional breakthrough. The tone wavers slightly
      toward philosophical reflection in the mirror vault section but recovers with
      the immediate threat of the Guild. Minor: could be slightly more tense in final
      paragraph.'
    ending_assessment: 'Excellent execution. Zara has passed through the Ordeal (internal
      transformation + bridge crossing), but faces new complication: Guild approaching
      from above, map dissolving, and unknown final guardian ahead. Sets up next stage
      perfectly.'
