  evidence: The story successfully incorporates all five Freytag's Pyramid beats and
    preserves all six core elements. The word count is within the valid range. Structural
    accuracy is good, though the Climax and Falling Action feel a little compressed.
    The tone is well-maintained, capturing the medical thriller tension and ethical
    weight.
