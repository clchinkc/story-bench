  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: The Debate beat is present with Sarah wrestling the core dilemma
    (recant vs. refuse). Three required elements are clearly executed: (1) recanting
    as the easy but wrong choice is explicitly considered, (2) going to authorities/official
    channels is discussed with Marcus, (3) internal conflict between duty and sister
    is powerfully articulated (''Duty versus blood. Badge versus sister.''). The conversation
    with Marcus effectively tips her toward the third option (going dark/rogue). Character
    voice is consistent—Sarah''s detective mindset shows in how she ''laid out the
    facts like a case file.'' The bridge to Break Into Two is strong, with the resignation
    letter providing narrative continuity. WEAKNESSES: Missing element #4—there''s
    no clear moment showing Sarah weighing the consequences or alternatives beyond
    the two main options presented. The beat lacks deeper internal deliberation about
    other possible solutions. CRITICAL VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah has already decided to
    resign and is executing that decision (''Sarah Chen—former detective, current
    vigilante—sat in a rented car'') before the Debate beat concludes, which violates
    the ''must not include Sarah already having resigned'' requirement. The AFTER
    section shows her resignation already completed, collapsing the Debate into the
    Break Into Two. (2) The transition shows her already outside the Marchetti compound
    conducting surveillance, which edges toward direct confrontation setup. Setting
    continuity is slightly compromised by the jump from kitchen to captain''s office
    to rented car without clear temporal markers. The Debate beat itself (the GENERATED
    section) executes well, but the AFTER section prematurely resolves the decision,
    undermining the beat''s narrative function of sustained internal conflict.'
