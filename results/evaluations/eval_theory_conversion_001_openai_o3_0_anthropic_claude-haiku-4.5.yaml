  evidence: 'EXPOSITION (Opening): Samira''s predictable world, her reputation, the
    custodian''s arrival, and the impossible viral structure establish status quo
    and inciting incident with lyrical precision. RISING ACTION (Paragraphs 3-6):
    Escalating complications—containment protocols, multiplying patients, discovery
    of Nexus connection, legal threats, and the ticking ventilator clock create mounting
    tension expertly. CLIMAX (Conference room scene): The highest point of tension
    where Samira faces the choice between career security and ethical responsibility;
    the decision to refuse the contract and walk to media vans represents the turning
    point. FALLING ACTION (Press conference & aftermath): Immediate consequences unfold—media
    exposure, market collapse, Nexus indictment, antiviral distribution, infection
    curves bending. DENOUEMENT (Final scene): New equilibrium established with Samira
    and Raj outside the building, her career sacrificed but the world restored to
    health, ending on reflective acceptance. All 6 core elements preserved: Samira
    (protagonist), engineered virus (discovery), Raj (supporting character), Nexus
    (antagonist), public cure release (open-access journals), career sacrifice (blacklisted,
    packing office). Tone maintains medical thriller tension throughout with ethical
    weight—clinical language (''capsid spiraled,'' ''glycoprotein,'' ''CRISPR-based
    counter-agent'') balanced against emotional stakes and moral clarity. Minor deduction
    (0.05) for structural_accuracy: the climax could be slightly more isolated/distinct
    from falling action, though the current integration is narratively effective.
    Minor deduction (0.05) for tone: one phrase (''indecent handshake'') risks tonal
    lightness in a thriller context, though it ultimately reinforces Samira''s voice.'
