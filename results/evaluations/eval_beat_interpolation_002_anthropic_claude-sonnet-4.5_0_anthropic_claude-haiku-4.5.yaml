  evidence: "STRENGTHS: Strong execution of internal conflict (duty vs. sister), clear\
    \ consideration of recanting option, explicit debate about official channels vs.\
    \ going rogue, Marcus Webb conversation effectively represents the 'seek advice'\
    \ element. Character voice remains consistent and compelling throughout. Good\
    \ bridge to Break Into Two beat with resignation decision. WEAKNESSES: Missing\
    \ the fourth required element\u2014no clear moment that tips her toward the third\
    \ option (going rogue while keeping testimony). The decision feels somewhat abrupt;\
    \ we see her conclude 'there is no good option' but lack a specific catalyst within\
    \ the debate that crystallizes the vigilante path. VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah has already\
    \ mentally committed to going rogue by mid-beat ('began planning her exit strategy'),\
    \ which slightly skips the true debate function. (2) The AFTER section shows her\
    \ already having resigned and sitting outside the Marchetti compound, which violates\
    \ the 'must not include Sarah already having resigned' constraint\u2014though\
    \ this is technically in the AFTER section, the transition is too clean and suggests\
    \ the resignation happened during this beat rather than at its conclusion. The\
    \ beat should end with the decision to resign, not with her already outside the\
    \ compound. CONTINUITY: Setting and character consistency maintained well. The\
    \ apartment-to-office-to-car progression is logical."
