  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw\u2014the original\
    \ was pure exposition-as-info-dump (telling, not showing). The revision transforms\
    \ this into a lived scene that reveals character through action and behavior.\
    \ FLAW CORRECTION: Fully addressed. The revision eliminates all summary statements\
    \ ('She was known for,' 'She enjoyed') and replaces them with: (1) Rachel's detective\
    \ instincts shown through her eye for detail at the case board ('eyes narrowing\
    \ at details others missed'); (2) Partnership with James demonstrated through\
    \ practiced dialogue and wordless communication ('The exchange was routine, practiced\
    \ over countless shifts'); (3) Devotion to cold cases revealed through her arriving\
    \ first, carrying unsolved files, and gravitating to the case board; (4) Setting\
    \ established through sensory details (Queens traffic, sirens, October morning,\
    \ precinct buzz, tarnished mug). The cat appears naturally in the opening scene.\
    \ PRESERVATION: All 5 required elements intact\u2014Detective Rachel Torres (name\
    \ preserved), Detective James Oyelaran (name, role, 3-year partnership implied\
    \ through 'practiced' exchanges), cat named Sherlock (present in opening), Queens\
    \ apartment (referenced via 'Queens traffic'), October Tuesday timing (explicit:\
    \ 'gusty Tuesday morning in October'). All 4 required phrases present verbatim\
    \ or near-exact. MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is a SUBSTANTIAL REWRITE (0.3\
    \ score), not minimal surgical edits. The original 2-paragraph info-dump is completely\
    \ restructured into a 7-paragraph scene with dialogue, action, sensory detail,\
    \ and narrative momentum. However, this level of revision was necessary because\
    \ the flaw was structural\u2014telling cannot be minimally edited into showing;\
    \ it requires scene reconstruction. The constraint to preserve elements was met,\
    \ but the constraint to make 'MINIMAL modifications' was violated. QUALITY: Excellent\
    \ prose quality. No new errors. Sensory language is vivid ('tuxedo tom,' 'badge-shaped\
    \ return stamp,' 'tarnished precinct mug,' 'red-thread maps'). Dialogue feels\
    \ natural. The ending hook ('the phone beside the board began to ring, cutting\
    \ through the hum like a warning bell') effectively transitions toward the inciting\
    \ incident. The revision demonstrates sophisticated understanding of showing vs.\
    \ telling and scene construction."
