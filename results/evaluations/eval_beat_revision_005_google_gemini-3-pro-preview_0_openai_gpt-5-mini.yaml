  model_said_no_revision: false
  evidence: The model did not state that no revision was needed. Instead it rewrote
    the provided passage, adding sensory details (e.g., 'smell of antiseptic and dying
    flowers', 'dirt being shoveled onto a coffin') and intensifying the despair. While
    the rewrite demonstrates partial understanding of Dark Night of the Soul elements
    (isolation, despair, mortality hints), it failed the task requirement to recognize
    the original segment as correctly executed and therefore made an unnecessary revision
    with no accompanying justification.
