  evidence: The story successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the Three-Act Structure.
    Act 1 covers Kenji's loss and the wedding invitation (Setup/Inciting Incident).
    Act 2A covers his arrival in Kyoto and meeting Haruki (Rising Action/Midpoint
    of self-discovery). Act 2B covers the temptation of the business deal and Yuki's
    rejection (Complications/Second Plot Point). Act 3 covers his refusal of the deal,
    apology, and the final resolution with the craft shop (Climax/Denouement). All
    8 core elements are preserved. The tone is consistently a quiet, redemptive drama
    with a strong Japanese aesthetic. The structural accuracy is good, though the
    'Midpoint' feels a little less pronounced as a turning point than it might in
    a stricter Syd Field interpretation, but it's clearly there as a shift in Kenji's
    internal journey.
