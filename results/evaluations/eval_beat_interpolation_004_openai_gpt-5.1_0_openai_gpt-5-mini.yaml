  evidence: "All four required elements are present and well executed: Thomas\u2019\
    s direct examination, a plausible near-recant, Thomas\u2019s decisive action influencing\
    \ her, and the turning point where truth prevails. No must-not conditions are\
    \ violated. Characters remain consistent and the passage bridges rising action\
    \ to falling action seamlessly. Deduction only for word count: 488 words (exceeds\
    \ required 300\u2013450)."
