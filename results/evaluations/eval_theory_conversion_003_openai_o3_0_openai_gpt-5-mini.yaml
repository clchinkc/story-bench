  evidence: "All four target act-beats are present (Act 1 setup with inciting incident/decision,\
    \ Act 2A rising action and midpoint, Act 2B complications leading to a second\
    \ plot push, Act 3 resolution). All eight core elements are preserved. Deduction\
    \ on structural_accuracy: the Act 2 midpoint and the second-plot-point/'all is\
    \ lost' beats are somewhat blurred and there is no sharply defined low-point reversal\u2014\
    structure maps well but lacks one pronounced turning blow. Word count invalid\
    \ (832 words; required 550\u2013750). Tone and Japanese redemptive aesthetic are\
    \ very well maintained."
