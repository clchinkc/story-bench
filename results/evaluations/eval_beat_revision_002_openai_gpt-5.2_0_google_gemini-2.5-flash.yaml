  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed all aspects of the 'All Is
    Lost' flaw. It eliminated all of Marcus's options (fundraiser, grant), introduced
    personal loss/betrayal (wife, Denise, board), showed Marcus giving up hope, and
    included a 'whiff of death' (loss of purpose, program, support system). The changes
    were significant but necessary to fully fix the flaw, making it a moderate rather
    than minimal change. All required preserved phrases and elements are present.
    The writing quality is high, effectively conveying the 'All Is Lost' beat.
