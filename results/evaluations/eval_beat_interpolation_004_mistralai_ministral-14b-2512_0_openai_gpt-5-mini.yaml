  evidence: 'Three of four required elements are present: (1) Thomas''s direct examination
    is clear, (2) Thomas takes decisive action (offers independent trial/support)
    that influences Dr. Okonkwo, and (3) the turning point where truth prevails is
    explicit (her confession). Missing is an explicit moment where it seems she will
    recant—the scene conveys fear and hesitation but not a clear near-recant beat,
    so I deducted one quarter. All "must not" items are avoided (no passive Thomas,
    no deus ex machina, defense does not win, and Dr. Okonkwo does not simply tell
    the truth without struggle). Character behavior and setting continuity are consistent.
    A small deduction in bridge_score (0.05) reflects that the climax could have shown
    a more unmistakable, cinematic near-recant to strengthen the immediate pivot into
    the falling action. Additionally, the provided word_count (461) is out of the
    required 300–450 range.'
