  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and excellently executed:
    (1) Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability—post-surgery taste loss, emotional
    isolation masked by legend status; (2) Relationship shifts from professional to
    personal—she moves from ''here to cook'' to ''here to feed you'' with emotional
    investment; (3) Shared moment creates genuine connection—the sopa de ajo scene
    with egg-stirring, sherry vinegar, and balcony threshold standing is intimate
    without being romantic; (4) Maya commits beyond contract—''I''m not here to perform.
    I''m here to feed you'' and ''meant more than the contract'' show emotional commitment.
    All must-not items avoided: they''re not in love (connection is nascent), she
    doesn''t leave, photo isn''t taken here, Alejandro''s walls lower (he laughs,
    admits truth, shows hope). Character voices are consistent—Maya''s practical warmth,
    Alejandro''s guarded-then-vulnerable arc. Bridge is seamless: BEFORE establishes
    stakes (debt, difficult employer, contract); GENERATED shows the emotional turning
    point where professional relationship becomes personal; AFTER shows the consequence
    (photo leak, separation). Setting continuity perfect: kitchen→balcony threshold→study.
    DEDUCTION: Word count exceeds range by 81 words (531 vs 300-450 max). This is
    a significant technical violation despite narrative excellence.'
