  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-delineated.
    Exposition establishes Samira''s reputation crisis and the impossible virus discovery.
    Rising Action spans the 72-hour investigation with escalating complications (adaptation,
    strategic evolution, discovery of Nexus connection). Climax peaks at the conference
    room confrontation where Samira leverages the cure formula as leverage. Falling
    Action covers the press conference and immediate institutional consequences. Denouement
    resolves with Samira''s quiet vindication and career pivot to service. All 6 core
    elements preserved: protagonist (Samira), engineered virus, Raj (supporting),
    Nexus (antagonist), public cure release, career sacrifice. Tone maintains medical
    thriller tension throughout with ethical weight—phrases like ''fugue of caffeine
    and dread,'' ''reptilian'' executives, and the moral stakes of public health vs.
    corporate liability. MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Structural accuracy slightly reduced (0.95
    vs 1.0) because the climax/falling action boundary is slightly compressed—the
    press conference functions as both climactic revelation and falling action consequence,
    which is narratively effective but technically blurs Freytag''s distinction. Tone
    score 0.95 (not 1.0) because the denouement shifts toward quiet reflection, which
    is thematically appropriate but slightly softens the thriller tension that dominated
    earlier sections. Word count (598) is within valid range (500-700).'
