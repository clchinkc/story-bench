  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Maya witnesses Alejandro''s vulnerability
    (his memories of his abuela and loneliness), the relationship shifts from professional
    to personal (distance evaporates), there is a clear shared moment creating genuine
    connection (midnight bread, tasting oil and salt), and Maya explicitly chooses
    to stay emotionally committed beyond the contract. The scene cleanly avoids the
    must-not items (no premature love, no contract breach decision, no photograph,
    Alejandro lowers his guard rather than remaining closed). Word count is invalid
    (474 words; required 300–450), so word_count_valid is false. I deducted 0.1 from
    the bridge_score because, while the midpoint commits Maya emotionally and raises
    stakes, it could more explicitly foreshadow consequences that lead into the subsequent
    scandal to create a slightly stronger bridge to the All-Is-Lost beat.'
