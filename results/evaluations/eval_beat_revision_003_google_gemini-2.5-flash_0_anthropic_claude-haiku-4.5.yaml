  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation\
    \ and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.\
    \ The revision fixes this precisely by: (1) Adding the phone hesitation moment\u2014\
    Sophie catches herself in the old reflex but chooses differently, (2) Explicitly\
    \ stating the insight ('they no longer felt like an inescapable current. She could\
    \ choose'), (3) Showing behavioral change through action (putting phone away,\
    \ declining to call Linda tonight), (4) Creating contrast via internal monologue\
    \ about seeing her world 'differently now', (5) Having the mother notice the change\
    \ ('noticing the phone's brief appearance'). All 4 required phrases preserved\
    \ exactly: 'Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare', 'How was Thailand? her mother asked',\
    \ 'The familiar Chicago skyline appeared', 'It's good to be home, she said'. Changes\
    \ were surgical: inserted phone hesitation paragraph, added mother's observation,\
    \ expanded final reflection on changed perspective. No elements removed, no new\
    \ errors introduced. The revision transforms a flat return into a genuine beat\
    \ that demonstrates integration of the journey's lessons into behavior."
