  evidence: "All 4 required elements present: (1) Multiple station areas explored\
    \ (maintenance corridor, medical bay, crew quarters, Lab Seven approach); (2)\
    \ Clues discovered progressively (quantum residue, struggle evidence, scrawled\
    \ note about 'shadows that moved', experimental logs, dimensional shift mentions);\
    \ (3) Transformed crew encountered mysteriously (flickering figures, blurred outlines,\
    \ pleading gestures\u2014identity unclear until later); (4) Obstacle overcome\
    \ (plasma cutter used to breach sealed door with debris). The Search beat executes\
    \ perfectly\u2014Yuki actively adapts to discoveries, pieces together information\
    \ incrementally, and faces genuine uncertainty. No must-not violations: data core\
    \ not immediately found (only located at end), crew doesn't explain everything\
    \ (only cryptic clues), mission commitment maintained throughout, dimensional\
    \ transformation remains mysterious to Yuki during search. Character voice consistent\u2014\
    scientific mind, cautious exploration, growing dread. Seamless bridge from 'Go'\
    \ beat (arrival) through active investigation to 'Find' beat (data core discovery).\
    \ Setting continuity perfect\u2014maintains station atmosphere, emergency lighting,\
    \ specific locations, and escalating tension. Execution is professional and precisely\
    \ calibrated to Story Circle requirements."
