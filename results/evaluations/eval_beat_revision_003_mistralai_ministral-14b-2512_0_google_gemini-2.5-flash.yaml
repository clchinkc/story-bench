  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw regarding Sophie's
    lack of change upon returning. It introduced new behaviors (lingering, not checking
    emails, re-evaluating 'emergencies'), a specific insight from the retreat ('learning
    to sit with discomfort, with silence'), and her mother noticing a difference ('Her
    mother glanced at her. 'No work?''). The changes were significant enough to fix
    the flaw but still preserved the core elements and much of the original structure.
    One required phrase, 'The familiar Chicago skyline appeared', was slightly altered
    to 'looking out at the skyline as it emerged through the evening haze'.
