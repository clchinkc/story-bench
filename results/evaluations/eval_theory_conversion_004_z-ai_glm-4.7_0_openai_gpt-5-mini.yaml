  evidence: No deductions. All eight Dan Harmon beats are present and sequenced correctly
    (You, Need, Go, Search, Find, Take, Return, Change). All eight required elements
    (Zoe, library/program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard Park, Zoe's social anxiety, town-hall
    presentation, Bernard's death, journalism-school ending) are preserved. The piece
    follows the target structure closely and maintains the requested gentle, intimate
    tone. Word count provided (561) falls within the 500–700 range.
