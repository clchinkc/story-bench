  evidence: The model did not state 'NO REVISION NEEDED'. Instead, it provided a revised
    segment, indicating it believed the original needed changes. While the revised
    segment is good and enhances the 'whiff of death' and despair, the original was
    already a strong execution of the beat. The model's revision suggests it didn't
    fully recognize the original's adequacy.
