  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Thomas directly examines Dr.
    Okonkwo; there is a clear moment where she appears likely to recant; Thomas takes
    decisive, personal action (abandoning script and appealing to her as a mother)
    that influences her; the turning point occurs when she admits the cover-up. No
    prohibited elements appear (no passive Thomas, no simple untroubled confession,
    no defense victory, no deus ex machina). Characters and setting remain consistent
    with the provided before/after beats.'
