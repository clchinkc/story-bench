  evidence: 'Conversion successfully maps all 4 three-act beats: Act 1 (empty office
    + letter catalyst establishing ordinary world and inciting incident through Kyoto
    invitation); Act 2A (train journey, village arrival, Haruki mentorship, failed
    conversations establishing obstacles and midpoint realization); Act 2B (business
    call temptation, Yuki''s disappointment, dark moment at tea house window creating
    complications and second plot point); Act 3 (phone deletion, shrine apology, wedding
    garden vigil, bamboo shop denouement). All 8 core elements preserved: Kenji protagonist,
    corporate loss, estranged Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki craftsman, business deal
    temptation, theme of people over ambition, craft shop ending. Tone masterfully
    maintained—quiet, contemplative, Japanese aesthetic (bamboo flute, rice paddies,
    shrine, tea house, cherry blossoms). Minor deduction: Act 2B could slightly sharpen
    the ''second plot point'' transition between phone deletion and shrine scene,
    though the emotional arc is clear. Prose quality exceptional with sensory detail
    and metaphorical precision.'
