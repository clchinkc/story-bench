  evidence: 'All four three-act beats are clearly present: Act 1 (ordinary world,
    inciting letter, first plot point = he goes to Kyoto), Act 2A (village integration,
    midpoint = brief belief he can re-enter Yuki''s life), Act 2B (complication =
    investor temptation and Yuki''s rejection as second plot point), Act 3 (climax
    = watching the wedding/apology, denouement = opening bamboo shop). All eight required
    elements appear (Kenji, lost career, Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki, business deal
    temptation, theme of people over ambition, ending bamboo shop). Tone (quiet drama,
    Japanese aesthetic, redemptive) is consistently maintained. No significant deductions.'
