  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Maya learns about Alejandro's\
    \ dulled sense of taste and emotional guardedness (vulnerability); their relationship\
    \ moves from contractual to personal via the shared soup and balcony moment; a\
    \ genuine connection is formed; Maya explicitly chooses to stay ('I want to').\
    \ The scene functions clearly as a midpoint \u2014 a commitment that raises stakes\
    \ and propels her from reactive to proactive. None of the prohibited items appear\
    \ (no pre-existing love, no decision to leave, no photograph, Alejandro lowers\
    \ his walls). Character behavior and setting remain consistent with the provided\
    \ Before/After beats. The only formal issue is word count: the provided scene\
    \ exceeds the requested 300\u2013450 range, so word_count_valid is false."
