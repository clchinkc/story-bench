  failed_constraints:
  - 'PARTIAL: Thomas Chen''s personal stake in the outcome is underdeveloped - his
    role is primarily supportive rather than showing how the decision affects him
    directly or what he stands to gain/lose'
  analysis:
    beats_present_detail: First Plot Point clearly established when Eleanor decides
      to publish the manuscript (point of no return - committing the printing house's
      resources to a controversial project). Act 2 Opening begins with 'With the decision
      made, Eleanor's thoughts turned to the task ahead' - new world of editing, oversight,
      and publication process clearly initiated.
    must_include_analysis:
      1_decision_to_publish: PRESENT - 'I want to publish it,' she said, her voice
        firm and resolute.
      2_central_conflict: PRESENT - Profit vs. ethics/danger established through the
        controversial Whitechapel manuscript and the financial desperation driving
        the decision.
      3_defying_expectations: PRESENT - Eleanor stepping into business leadership
        role explicitly defies Victorian gender norms ('Eleanor had spent twenty-six
        years being told that business was not a woman's domain').
      4_thomas_as_ally: WEAK - Thomas is present and supportive, but his personal
        stake is not clearly established. We see his approval but not what he stands
        to gain or lose.
      5_hint_of_danger: PRESENT - 'The Whitechapel Murders' title, sensationalism,
        'darkness itself was watching her every move,' and the implicit danger of
        publishing controversial content about real murders.
      6_threshold_crossed: PRESENT - Publishing decision is irreversible; she's committed
        resources and reputation to a dangerous path.
    tone_assessment: 'Gothic tension maintained throughout with fog, shadows, darkness
      imagery. Feminist undertones strong in Eleanor''s defiance and determination.
      Victorian atmosphere well-established. Minor weakness: some passages become
      slightly overwrought with metaphor (''darkness receding,'' ''story unfolded
      within her'') which occasionally dilutes rather than intensifies the tension.'
    ending_assessment: Strong conclusion with Eleanor committed to dangerous path
      and Act 2 clearly begun. The final paragraphs establish rising action (editing,
      oversight, publication process ahead). Ending successfully positions her as
      having crossed the point of no return.
