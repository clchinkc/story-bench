  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the core flaw of the Ordeal
    being a mere boss battle. It successfully integrated Kira's deepest fear (guilt
    over her brother's death) into the dragon's taunts, creating a 'death' moment
    where Kira nearly gives up. Her subsequent realization and shift in motivation
    ('not fighting to avenge him. She was fighting to stop being the girl who failed
    him.') represents a clear transformation and new understanding. The victory comes
    from this internal shift, not just persistence. The changes were significant enough
    to fix the flaw but maintained the original structure and many phrases. One required
    phrase was slightly altered ('The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking
    roar' vs 'The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar').
