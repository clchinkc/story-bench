  analysis:
    beats_analysis: Both required beats are excellently executed. 'Approach to the
      Inmost Cave' occurs at the obsidian door with copper ribs—the literal threshold
      before the Library. 'The Ordeal' spans the pressure-plate corridor, quicksand
      pit, and symbolic death/rebirth, culminating in the discovery of volatility
      charges. The progression is clear and narratively satisfying.
    must_include_analysis:
      1_escape_vs_help_choice: 'PRESENT - Zara chooses to stay with limping Tomás
        rather than flee alone through familiar routes. The internal conflict is explicit:
        ''Survival tugged at her like a familiar friend'' vs. her mother''s wisdom
        about not taking alone.'
      2_trap_requiring_thief_skills: PRESENT - The pressure-plate corridor with sun/scorpion
        tiles requires Zara to read mechanical language, feel for spring mechanisms,
        and navigate misdirection. Her knife-hilt technique demonstrates mastery.
      3_revelation_of_tomás_motivation: PRESENT - Tomás confesses his dissertation
        was burned for quoting the Codex of Redactions; he seeks personal redemption
        alongside helping Zara. The guilt flicker and his admission create moral complexity.
      4_confronting_fear_of_failure: 'PRESENT - In the quicksand pit, Zara''s fear
        is explicitly internal: ''her fear wasn''t of dying; it was of failing, of
        returning home empty-handed to the raspy cough.'' This psychological depth
        transcends physical danger.'
      5_symbolic_death_rebirth: 'PRESENT - The quicksand pit functions as symbolic
        death: suffocation, darkness, weight of past sins (stolen trinkets). Emergence
        into light with sand shedding like ''a second skin shed'' is rebirth. The
        narrative explicitly acknowledges this: ''Symbolic death, whispered a corner
        of her mind. Rebirth buys passage.'''
      6_zara_changed_by_ordeal: 'PRESENT - Post-ordeal Zara is transformed: ''she
        had crossed a threshold where retreat wasn''t an option...stripped her to
        purpose.'' She moves from reactive thief to purposeful agent, seeing Tomás
        as tied to her redemption rather than mere ally.'
    must_not_analysis:
      1_no_cure_found: AVOIDED - Zara discovers the Library's outer stacks but not
        the cure. The story ends with new complications (volatility charges).
      2_no_romantic_subplot: AVOIDED - Relationship remains professional/alliance-based.
        No romantic tension, attraction, or intimacy.
      3_no_tomás_death: AVOIDED - Tomás survives the quicksand pit and remains alive
        at story's end.
      4_no_magic_or_supernatural_abilities: AVOIDED - All of Zara's abilities are
        thief-skills (knife work, pressure-plate reading, route memorization, weight
        distribution). No supernatural elements present.
    tone_analysis: 'The tone is consistently tense with morally complex layers. Desperation
      permeates (Guild pursuit, mother''s illness, time pressure). Moments of hope
      emerge through Zara''s competence and her choice to help Tomás. The revelation
      of Tomás''s selfish motivation adds moral ambiguity without undermining the
      partnership. The prose balances visceral action (sand choking, bootsteps booming)
      with introspective moments (guilt flickering, fear of failure). Minor tone variance:
      the final line (''knowing the true test had only just begun'') edges slightly
      toward dramatic convention rather than maintaining the grounded, desperate tone,
      but this is minimal.'
    ending_analysis: 'Excellent execution of the requirement. Zara has passed through
      the Ordeal (quicksand pit = symbolic death/rebirth; pressure plates = test of
      skill). She emerges changed—purposeful, unified with Tomás, stripped to core
      motivation. The new complication is immediate and escalating: volatility charges
      threaten to destroy the Library entirely, creating a ticking-clock urgency that
      raises stakes beyond personal survival. This sets up the ''Road Back'' and ''Resurrection''
      beats perfectly.'
    constraint_failures:
    - 'WORD COUNT: 704 words exceeds the 500-700 range by 4 words. This is a technical
      violation, though minimal (0.6% over). The excess comes from the final line
      and some descriptive passages that could be trimmed.'
    strengths:
    - Masterful integration of both required beats with clear narrative progression
    - All six must-include elements woven organically into the narrative
    - Excellent character development for both Zara and Tomás
    - Visceral, sensory-rich prose that maintains tension
    - Moral complexity without melodrama
    - Strong thematic coherence (taking vs. giving, masks, redemption)
    - Ending perfectly positions next story beats
    minor_weaknesses:
    - Word count exceeds limit by 4 words (technical violation)
    - Final line slightly shifts toward dramatic convention
  failed_constraints:
  - 'word_count_exceeds_range: 704 words vs. 500-700 range (4 words over limit)'
error: null
