  evidence: The story successfully maps the original three acts into Freytag's five
    stages, clearly delineating Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action,
    and Resolution. All core elements are preserved. The word count is too low. The
    tone is largely maintained, but the Climax feels a little rushed in its transition
    from the realization to the confrontation and public release of the cure, slightly
    diminishing the build-up that a true climax might have.
