  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated: (1) You—opening
    sanctuary in library with safety/predictability; (2) Need—explicit statement of
    wanting to matter, aching for more; (3) Go—Ms. Okafor''s intervention and first
    interview with Bernard; (4) Search—repeated visits, learning to listen, overcoming
    awkwardness; (5) Find—breakthrough moment when Bernard shares his deepest truth
    and trusts her; (6) Take—town hall presentation where she publicly shares his
    story; (7) Return—continuing to visit Bernard, his death, funeral speech, ordinary
    life resuming; (8) Change—journalism applications and demonstrated transformation
    in final paragraph. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library
    setting, oral history program, Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key
    relationship), social anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic
    moment), Bernard''s death and funeral (resolution). Structure elegantly mirrors
    Harmon''s theory with clear progression through comfort→need→departure→struggle→discovery→sacrifice→return→transformation.
    Tone is consistently gentle, intimate, and emotionally true—introspective without
    being maudlin, hopeful without being saccharine. Minor deduction (0.05) for structural_accuracy:
    the ''Take'' beat could be slightly more emphasized as a cost/sacrifice moment,
    though the town hall does function as both revelation and risk. Minor tone deduction
    (0.05): final paragraph edges slightly toward inspirational rather than purely
    intimate, though it remains grounded and earned.'
