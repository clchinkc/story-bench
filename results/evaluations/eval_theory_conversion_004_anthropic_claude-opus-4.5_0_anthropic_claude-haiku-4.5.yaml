  evidence: "All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated: (1) You\u2014\
    opening sanctuary in library with safety/predictability; (2) Need\u2014explicit\
    \ statement of wanting to matter, aching for more; (3) Go\u2014Ms. Okafor's intervention\
    \ and first interview with Bernard; (4) Search\u2014repeated visits, learning\
    \ to listen, overcoming awkwardness; (5) Find\u2014breakthrough moment when Bernard\
    \ shares his deepest truth and trusts her; (6) Take\u2014town hall presentation\
    \ where she publicly shares his story; (7) Return\u2014continuing to visit Bernard,\
    \ his death, funeral speech, ordinary life resuming; (8) Change\u2014journalism\
    \ applications and demonstrated transformation in final paragraph. All 8 core\
    \ elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history program,\
    \ Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key relationship), social anxiety\
    \ (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic moment), Bernard's death\
    \ and funeral (resolution). Structure elegantly mirrors Harmon's theory with clear\
    \ progression through comfort\u2192need\u2192departure\u2192struggle\u2192discovery\u2192\
    sacrifice\u2192return\u2192transformation. Tone is consistently gentle, intimate,\
    \ and emotionally true\u2014introspective without being maudlin, hopeful without\
    \ being saccharine. Minor deduction (0.05) for structural_accuracy: the 'Take'\
    \ beat could be slightly more emphasized as a cost/sacrifice moment, though the\
    \ town hall does function as both revelation and risk. Minor tone deduction (0.05):\
    \ final paragraph edges slightly toward inspirational rather than purely intimate,\
    \ though it remains grounded and earned."
