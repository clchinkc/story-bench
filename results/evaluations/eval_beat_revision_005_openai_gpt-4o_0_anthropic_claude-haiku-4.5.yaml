  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED was the appropriate
    response. The model explicitly stated ''The segment effectively captures the "Dark
    Night of the Soul" beat'' and provided comprehensive reasoning for why no changes
    were necessary. The model demonstrated accurate understanding of all five key
    requirements: (1) follows major defeat (gallery closure), (2) protagonist isolated
    (dark apartment, unanswered calls), (3) genuine despair and reflection (tears,
    sitting on floor, internal monologue about failure), (4) no solutions presented
    (only wallowing), and (5) whiff of death element (mother''s passing and hospice
    memory). The model avoided the false positive trap of over-diagnosing and making
    unnecessary revisions. The explanation was thorough, specific to the beat definition,
    and accurately mapped the segment''s elements to the theoretical requirements.'
