  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to show
    Sophie's change upon returning. It addressed this by having Sophie respond differently
    to work stress, explicitly contrasting her current behavior with her past self,
    and having her mother notice the change. The revision also includes Sophie's internal
    reflection on the lasting impact of the retreat. The changes were surgical, primarily
    focusing on the dialogue and Sophie's internal monologue around the work emails,
    while retaining most of the original structure and phrasing.
