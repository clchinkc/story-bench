  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Sarah contemplates recanting,
    considers going through official channels (conversation with Marcus), struggles
    with duty vs. sister, and a conversation/moment pushes her toward a dangerous
    third option. None of the forbidden items appear (no immediate rogue decision,
    no one else makes the choice, no prior resignation, no direct confrontation).
    Character behavior and setting remain consistent and it cleanly bridges into the
    Break Into Two.'
