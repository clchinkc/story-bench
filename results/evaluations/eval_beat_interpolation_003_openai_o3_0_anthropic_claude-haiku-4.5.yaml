  evidence: "REQUIRED ELEMENTS (4/4 present): (1) Multiple station areas explored\u2014\
    crew quarters, medical bay, research wing with deliberate progression; (2) Clues\
    \ discovered systematically\u2014unmade bunks, half-finished chess game, singed\
    \ lab coat, scrawled warning 'THEY'RE STILL HERE', patient files showing impossible\
    \ vitals; (3) Transformed crew encountered mysteriously\u2014shimmer-forms, distortion\
    \ anomalies, sparking silhouettes, temperature drops, no immediate explanation;\
    \ (4) Obstacles overcome\u2014sealed quarantine bulkhead requiring biometric spoofing,\
    \ scanner interference, navigation challenges. BEAT EXECUTION: Perfectly executes\
    \ Search phase\u2014active exploration, incremental discovery, adaptation (hot-wiring\
    \ panel), struggle against unknowns, mounting tension without resolution. MUST-NOT\
    \ VIOLATIONS (0/4): Avoids all prohibited elements\u2014data core not found yet\
    \ (only referenced as destination), crew doesn't explain transformation (only\
    \ cryptic presence), mission continues (not abandoning), Yuki arrives ignorant\
    \ of dimensional shift (discovers it through evidence). CHARACTER CONSISTENCY:\
    \ Yuki maintains scientist's methodical approach (recording data, scanning, filing\
    \ unknowns), balances fear with mission focus, problem-solves under pressure.\
    \ BRIDGE QUALITY: Seamless transition from 'Go' (arrival) to 'Search' (exploration)\
    \ to 'Find' (data core located but not yet obtained). CONTINUITY: Setting details\
    \ preserved (red emergency lighting, zero-g chess, Jupiter viewport context),\
    \ timeline coherent, physics consistent with established world."
