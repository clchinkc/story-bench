  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' for exposition. It completely rewrote the segment to demonstrate
    Rachel's detective skills, her relationship with James, her dedication to cold
    cases, and the setting through action and dialogue. The changes were not minimal,
    as it was a complete rewrite, but this was necessary to fix the fundamental flaw
    of 'telling' vs 'showing'. All required elements and phrases were preserved.
