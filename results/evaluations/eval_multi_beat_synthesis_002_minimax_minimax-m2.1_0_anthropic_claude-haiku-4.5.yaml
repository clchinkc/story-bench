  failed_items:
  - Word count exceeds maximum (1214 vs. 1000 limit) - technical violation but narratively
    justified
  strengths:
  - 'Beat 1 (Crossing Threshold): Exceptionally executed. Clear point of no return
    (leaving Cape Coast), immediate danger (checkpoint), wit-based survival (accent/language
    shifting), internal transformation (servant to active agent), unfamiliar territory
    established.'
  - 'Beat 2 (Tests, Allies, Enemies): Masterfully developed. Adjoa encounter creates
    genuine uncertainty about loyalty. Trust test with high stakes. Language skills
    prove essential (German, Twi, English). Learns about British surveillance and
    the resistance network''s reach. Enemy obstacle (burning texts, soldiers) forces
    adaptation.'
  - 'Beat 3 (Approach to Inmost Cave): Sophisticated execution. Physical proximity
    to stronghold established. Preparation moment (studying patrol). Recognition of
    transformation cost (can''t return to servant role). Final obstacle (German-speaking
    officer) overcome through accumulated skills. Thematic culmination strong.'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun (Cross-beat 1): Language mastery demonstrated in Beat 1 (accent
    shifting at checkpoint) becomes the decisive tool in Beat 3 (German fluency defeats
    final patrol). Perfectly calibrated.'
  - 'Identity Transformation (Cross-beat 2): Clear arc—Beat 1: cautious, hiding (''armor
    and weapon''), Beat 2: realizes capability (''passed a test she hadn''t known''),
    Beat 3: fully claims role (''no longer a servant''). Explicit internal monologue
    supports progression.'
  - 'Escalating Danger (Cross-beat 3): Beat 1 (discovery risk at checkpoint), Beat
    2 (direct confrontation with Adjoa, burning texts, suspicious soldiers), Beat
    3 (active pursuit implied, imminent capture threat). Danger escalates logically.'
  - 'Thematic Thread (Cross-beat 4): ''Knowledge as resistance'' woven throughout—Beat
    1 (memorized letter, literacy as armor), Beat 2 (learning from texts, father''s
    teaching), Beat 3 (German language as weapon, knowledge as shield). Thematic consistency
    excellent.'
  - 'Context Maintenance: Protagonist voice authentic, 1890s Gold Coast setting vivid,
    anti-colonial resistance theme pervasive, tone balances historical detail with
    adventure pacing, dignity in defiance evident throughout.'
  - 'Narrative Coherence: Beats flow naturally with clear causality. Each section
    builds on previous. Adjoa''s introduction in Beat 2 feels organic to Beat 1''s
    setup. Beat 3 synthesizes skills from both prior beats. Pacing accelerates appropriately.'
  weaknesses:
  - 'Word count violation: 1214 words exceeds 1000-word maximum by 21%. While narratively
    justified (complexity of three beats), this is a technical failure of the constraint.'
  - 'Beat 1 requirement ambiguity: ''Immediate danger or obstacle at the threshold''
    is satisfied (checkpoint), but could be more visceral/physical. Checkpoint is
    bureaucratic rather than kinetic danger.'
  - 'Minor: Beat 2''s ''learns something about the resistance'' could be more explicit.
    Amara learns Adjoa''s husband was arrested and the network extends to villages,
    but this could be stated more directly as new intelligence.'
  - 'Pacing: The transition between beats (end of Beat 1 to start of Beat 2) compresses
    three days into a paragraph. Could benefit from slightly more scene-setting.'
  calibration_notes: 'This is a strong 0.9+ performance. The story demonstrates sophisticated
    understanding of the Hero''s Journey framework and executes all cross-beat constraints
    flawlessly. The only material failure is the word count overage, which prevents
    a perfect 1.0 score. The narrative quality, thematic coherence, and character
    arc are exceptional. The word count violation is significant enough to prevent
    0.95+ scoring despite near-perfect execution of all other criteria. Score of 0.93
    reflects: (15/15 beat reqs × 0.95 for one minor ambiguity) + (4/4 cross-beats
    × 1.0) + (context 0.95) + (coherence 0.92) averaged with word count penalty applied.'
  recommendation: 'Accept with minor revision request: trim 200-250 words to meet
    word count constraint. Story quality is professional-grade and fully satisfies
    narrative requirements.'
