  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently.\
    \ (1) Direct examination occurs with foundational questions about her role and\
    \ data accuracy. (2) Near-recant moment is powerfully rendered\u2014she initially\
    \ denies discrepancies ('Not discrepancies that would affect patient safety'),\
    \ creating genuine tension. (3) Thomas takes decisive action by asking the probing\
    \ question about threats/promises, which directly influences her decision to testify\
    \ truthfully. (4) Clear turning point: her admission under oath ('The data was\
    \ falsified') irrevocably shifts trial outcome. The climax executes its narrative\
    \ function perfectly\u2014highest tension, protagonist action determines outcome,\
    \ axis of trial tilts toward judgment. MUST-NOT ITEMS: All avoided. She doesn't\
    \ simply tell truth; internal struggle and coercion are central. Thomas is highly\
    \ active, not passive\u2014his strategic questioning and emotional appeal ('As\
    \ a physician and as a mother') directly influence her choice. Defense doesn't\
    \ win; case proceeds to guilty verdict. No deus ex machina; resolution comes from\
    \ character choice under pressure. CHARACTER: Thomas's voice remains consistent\u2014\
    strategic, empathetic, morally driven. Dr. Okonkwo's fear and internal conflict\
    \ are authentic and consistent with setup. BRIDGE: Seamless connection between\
    \ rising action (setup of her fear) and climax (that fear being confronted and\
    \ overcome). CONTINUITY: Courtroom setting maintained, all details align with\
    \ prior narrative. ONLY ISSUE: Word count exceeds range by 38 words (488 vs. 300-450\
    \ max), but this is a minor technical violation that doesn't affect narrative\
    \ quality or beat execution."
