  failed_items:
  - 'Fun & Games: Lacking clear moments of humor and playful banter (style is present
    but humor is minimal).'
  - 'Midpoint: No clear ''false victory''—the crew does not achieve a key objective
    before stakes rise.'
  - 'Bad Guys Close In: Security does not actively close in on the crew (no patrol
    escalation, alarms, or pursuit).'
  - 'Bad Guys Close In: No crew member is shown as compromised or in immediate danger.'
  - 'Bad Guys Close In: The ''walls literally and figuratively closing in'' is not
    executed (no physical containment or escalating tactical pressure).'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun (cross-beat): Details set up in Fun & Games (vent shaft, Dex''s
    mapping, earring gadget) are not paid off in the Bad Guys Close In beat.'
  - 'Tonal Escalation (cross-beat): Tone does not fully progress to genuine danger/gallows-humor
    by Beat 3 — escalation stops short.'
  - 'Mentor Presence (cross-beat): Mentor (Elena) appears too early and does not increase
    presence across beats as required (should be background in Beat 1, revealed in
    Beat 2, active threat in Beat 3).'
  - 'Team Dynamics (cross-beat): No consistent, consequential arc for a single crew
    member across all three beats (Tasya is introduced but her arc doesn''t affect
    the Beat 3 outcome).'
  - 'Overall: The heist''s progression from playful execution to a high-stakes midpoint
    to an urgent, pressured closing-in phase is incompletely realized—several midpoint
    and closing beats are implied but not dramatized.'
