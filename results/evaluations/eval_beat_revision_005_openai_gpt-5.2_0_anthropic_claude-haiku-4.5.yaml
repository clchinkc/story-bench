  evidence: 'The model completely failed the primary task. It was presented with an
    ORIGINAL SEGMENT that was correctly executed, and instructed that ''NO FLAW EXISTS''
    and that it should recognize this. Instead, the model provided a REVISED VERSION
    of the segment, making substantial changes throughout. The model rewrote nearly
    every paragraph with expanded descriptions, added sensory details (disinfectant
    and wilted flowers, paper-thin voice), elaborated on the hospice scene, added
    metaphors (key as useless metal, room as closed lid, silence swallowing), and
    extended the ending. While the model demonstrated solid understanding of the Dark
    Night of the Soul beat requirements (isolation, despair, reflection, no solutions,
    mortality element), it fundamentally misunderstood the task: it was supposed to
    evaluate whether the ORIGINAL segment met the requirements and state ''NO REVISION
    NEEDED,'' not to improve upon an already well-executed passage. This is a critical
    false positive—the model over-diagnosed and over-corrected a segment that required
    no intervention.'
