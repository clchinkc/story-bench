  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World - coastal village pottery
    life, (2) Call to Adventure - dried spring crisis, (3) Refusal of Call - ''I''m
    not my grandmother'', (4) Meeting the Mentor - grandmother''s letter discovery,
    (5) Crossing Threshold - begins three-day climb, (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies - mountain
    obstacles (loose rocks, storms, cold), (7) Approach to Inmost Cave - shrine ruins
    exploration, (8) Ordeal - despair at finding nothing, breakthrough with journal,
    (9) Reward - creates the vessel through surrender, (10) Road Back - treacherous
    return journey with storm test, (11) Resurrection - realizes transformation mid-journey,
    (12) Return with Elixir - PARTIALLY PRESENT but underdeveloped. The final spring
    ceremony and water return occur, but the ''elixir'' (knowledge/transformation)
    isn''t fully crystallized as a distinct beat separate from the return itself.
    The transformation is stated rather than dramatically demonstrated. PRESERVATION:
    All 7 elements intact - Maya (protagonist), pottery/ceramics (central), grandmother''s
    legacy (journal, tools, letter), mountain shrine (three-day journey), dried spring
    (problem driver), surrender theme (explicit in journal entry and clay work), transformation
    (clearly shown). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Strong adherence to monomyth structure with
    clear progression through most stages. Minor weakness: Resurrection and Return
    with Elixir blend together rather than being distinct phases. The story doesn''t
    fully separate the moment of personal rebirth from the moment of community impact/elixir
    delivery. TONE: Consistently meditative and quiet throughout. Introspective language
    (''trembling fingers,'' ''bone-deep cold,'' ''despair overwhelmed her'') maintains
    contemplative quality. Transformative arc is clear and earned. Word count: 621
    words (within 600-800 range).'
