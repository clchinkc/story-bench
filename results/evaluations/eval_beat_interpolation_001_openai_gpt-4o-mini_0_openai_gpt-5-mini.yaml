  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he provides practical wisdom and a tangible tool (leather-bound journal); Elena''s
    doubt shifts toward reluctant acceptance (a ''flicker'' of hope); Marcus references
    her librarian skills as useful. None of the forbidden items appear: Elena does
    not become immediately confident or eager, Marcus does not solve her problems
    or offer to accompany her, the scene is set in Marcus''s shop (not the forest),
    and Elena does not discover magical powers. No deductions were necessary.'
