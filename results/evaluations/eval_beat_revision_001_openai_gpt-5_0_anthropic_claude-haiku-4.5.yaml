  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: The Ordeal was executed\
    \ as a mere boss battle rather than a transformative psychological crisis. The\
    \ revision precisely addresses all four required corrections: (1) The dragon exploits\
    \ Kira's deepest fear by weaponizing her guilt over her brother's death, speaking\
    \ directly to her trauma ('your brother died because you hesitated'); (2) A clear\
    \ death moment occurs when Kira 'welcomed' the darkness and accepted failure ('Let\
    \ the dark take me too'), representing psychological surrender; (3) Transformation\
    \ is explicit\u2014she moves from guilt-driven denial to acceptance ('I failed\
    \ him. I loved him. I cannot change it'), fundamentally reframing her relationship\
    \ to the past; (4) Victory flows from new understanding rather than persistence\
    \ alone\u2014she defeats the dragon by recognizing it as a manifestation of her\
    \ own fear ('You haunt what hurts. But hurt isn't truth'). All four required phrases\
    \ are preserved verbatim or near-verbatim: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across\
    \ the chasm' (exact), 'The creature was massive\u2014twenty feet of obsidian scales\
    \ and burning eyes' (exact), '\"You cannot defeat me, child,\" the dragon rumbled'\
    \ (exact), 'The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar' (exact). The\
    \ changes are surgical rather than wholesale\u2014the model retained the setting,\
    \ structure, and outcome while inserting psychological depth into the existing\
    \ battle framework. The revision adds approximately 150 words of internal monologue\
    \ and dragon dialogue while maintaining the original's skeleton. Writing quality\
    \ is professional with no new errors; the prose achieves literary sophistication\
    \ ('ash and then air,' 'the chasm within her') without sacrificing clarity. Minor\
    \ deduction from minimal_change_score reflects the substantial addition of internal\
    \ monologue, though this was necessary and appropriate for fixing the flaw."
