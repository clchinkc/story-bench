  evidence: The model correctly identified the 'telling vs. showing' flaw in the original
    exposition. It revised the segment to show Rachel's detective skills through her
    focus on cold cases and deciphering photographs, her relationship with James through
    their teasing dialogue and shared history, and the setting through sensory details
    like the hum of lights and jazz music. The cat is naturally integrated. The changes
    were not minimal; it was a significant rewrite to achieve the 'showing' aspect,
    but it successfully addressed the core flaw. The quality is good, though the cat's
    'gritty aura' and 'unraveling mysteries' feel a little over-the-top for exposition.
