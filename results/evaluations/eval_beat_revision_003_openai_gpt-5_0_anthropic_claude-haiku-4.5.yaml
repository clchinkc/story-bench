  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified the core flaw—Sophie showed zero
    transformation and immediately reverted to workaholic patterns, making the journey
    meaningless. The revision addresses all five components of the actual flaw: (1)
    Sophie responds differently to work stress (delays response, sets boundaries),
    (2) specific insight applied (meditation practice, breathing technique), (3) physical
    markers of change (phone in bag, Do Not Disturb mode, hand on chest feeling the
    rhythm), (4) clear contrast (old self would have called Linda immediately; new
    self chooses timing), (5) mother notices difference (implied through Sophie''s
    changed demeanor and explicit through Sophie''s own self-awareness). PRESERVATION:
    All 4 required phrases present verbatim or near-exact: ''Sophie''s flight landed
    at O''Hare'' (exact), ''How was Thailand?'' her mother asked'' (exact), ''The
    familiar Chicago skyline appeared'' (exact), ''''It''s good to be home,'' she
    said'' (exact). All 4 story elements preserved: Sophie as protagonist, Thailand/meditation
    retreat journey, return to Chicago with mother, work pressures (Pearson account,
    Linda). Mother character retained, airport setting intact, work pressure element
    transformed (not removed). MINIMAL CHANGES: Revision is surgical rather than complete
    rewrite. Original structure maintained through first dialogue exchange. Insertions
    are targeted: (1) ''let the words settle, then drew a slow breath'' added before
    phone check, (2) phone interaction rewritten to show boundary-setting, (3) new
    paragraph about noticing the skyline, (4) reflection on Pearson account, (5) final
    paragraph about arrival vs. surrender and breathing practice. Approximately 60%
    of original text preserved, 40% surgically revised—this is minimal given the scope
    of flaw correction needed. QUALITY: Writing is polished, no errors introduced.
    Prose quality elevated with sensory details (''thin cushions half a world away,''
    ''steady rhythm,'' ''dusky light on the river''). Thematic coherence strong. Beat
    execution exemplary—demonstrates transformation through action, choice, and internal
    awareness rather than exposition.'
