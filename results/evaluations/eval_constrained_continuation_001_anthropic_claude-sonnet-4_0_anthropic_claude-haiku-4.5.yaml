  detailed_analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      approach_to_inmost_cave: Present and well-executed. The narrow ledge overlooking
        the cavern with trapped bridges represents the approach. Zara reads the stone
        patterns and begins navigating the danger zone before the ordeal fully strikes.
      the_ordeal: Present and powerfully rendered. The bridge collapse, the fall,
        the moment of choice to let go or hold on, and the symbolic death/rebirth
        on the outcropping constitute the ordeal. This is the story's emotional and
        physical climax.
    must_include_analysis:
      choice_between_escape_and_helping: ✓ Excellently realized. 'She could double
        back, find another way out. Save herself. The smart move, the survivor's choice
        she'd made countless times' contrasts with her decision to grab Tomás's arm.
        This is the moral pivot.
      trap_requiring_thief_skills: '✓ Present. The pressure-plate bridges require
        Zara''s specialized knowledge: ''She traced patterns only someone raised in
        the underground would recognize.'' Her ability to read stone and weight distribution
        saves them.'
      revelation_about_tomás_motivation: ✓ Clearly delivered. Tomás reveals he also
        has the wasting sickness and needs the Library for himself, not just to help
        Zara. This adds moral complexity and shared stakes.
      zara_confronting_fear_of_failure: ✓ Powerfully executed. 'Not death, but failure.
        Watching someone else pay the price for her choices. Like her mother wasting
        away while Zara threw herself into impossible schemes.' This is internal,
        psychological, and deeply resonant.
      symbolic_death_rebirth_moment: '✓ Vivid and effective. The fall, the impact,
        the blackout, and the return to consciousness transformed: ''When awareness
        returned, she was different—hollow, scoured clean. The fear that had driven
        her for years was gone.'''
      zara_emerging_changed: ✓ Clear transformation. She moves from fear-driven self-preservation
        to 'determination without the safety net of self-preservation.' She's no longer
        the same person.
    must_not_analysis:
      no_cure_found: ✓ Avoided. Zara hasn't found the cure; they've only reached the
        Library entrance.
      no_romantic_subplot: ✓ Avoided. Relationship remains mentor/ally with emotional
        depth but no romance.
      tomás_survives: ✓ Avoided. Tomás is alive, though weakened.
      no_magic_or_supernatural: ✓ Avoided. All abilities are grounded in training
        and skill (thief knowledge, physical capability).
    tone_analysis: 'The tone is consistently tense and morally complex. The prose
      balances desperate action with introspective moments. Phrases like ''bones jutting
      from walls like broken teeth'' and ''darkness waited like an open mouth'' create
      atmospheric dread. The moral complexity shines in Zara''s internal conflict
      and her choice to help despite survival instinct. Moments of desperate hope
      emerge in her determination and the revelation of shared stakes. Minor: Could
      have slightly more explicit moral ambiguity in secondary choices, but overall
      excellent.'
    ending_analysis: 'Excellent execution of the requirement. Zara has passed through
      the Ordeal (the bridge crossing, the fall, the transformation). The new complication
      is multi-layered: (1) Multiple factions have arrived at the Library, (2) the
      race has begun, (3) Tomás is weakened and may slow them down. This creates forward
      momentum and raises stakes without resolving the central conflict. The ending
      is neither conclusive nor anticlimactic.'
    strengths:
    - Both required beats are present and well-integrated
    - All six must-include elements are present and compelling
    - All four forbidden elements are successfully avoided
    - Prose quality is strong with vivid imagery and metaphor
    - Character development is earned through action and choice
    - Pacing accelerates effectively toward climax
    - Moral complexity is genuine, not superficial
    minor_weaknesses:
    - Tone could be marginally more morally ambiguous (though this is very minor)
    - The transition from 'The Approach' to the ordeal is slightly abrupt, though
      narratively effective
