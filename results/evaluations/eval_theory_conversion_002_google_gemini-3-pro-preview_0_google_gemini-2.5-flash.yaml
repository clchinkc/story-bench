  evidence: The story successfully hits all 12 beats of the Hero's Journey and preserves
    all 7 core elements. The 'Meeting the Mentor' beat is subtly integrated through
    the Elder's words and Maya's grandmother's journal/memory, which works well for
    the quiet tone. The 'Allies' and 'Enemies' beats are less explicit, but the internal
    struggle and the natural elements (mountain, storm) serve as antagonists, and
    the memory of the grandmother acts as an ally. The word count exceeds the specified
    range. The tone is mostly quiet and meditative, but some descriptions lean slightly
    more dramatic than 'quiet' (e.g., 'crushing weight of expectation', 'kiln fired
    too hot').
