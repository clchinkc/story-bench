  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated: (1) You—opening
    library sanctuary; (2) Need—unnamed desire to speak, fear of voice; (3) Go—bicycle
    ride to Bernard''s porch; (4) Search—five visits of awkward interviews, learning
    to listen; (5) Find—breakthrough moment of silence and story-pouring; (6) Take—town
    hall presentation, speaking publicly; (7) Return—autumn, senior year, ordinary
    life resumed; (8) Change—demonstrated through college essays, campus tours, reframed
    relationship with silence. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library
    setting, oral history program, Ms. Okafor (initiator), Bernard Park (key relationship),
    social anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic Take beat),
    Bernard''s death and funeral (Return phase). Structural accuracy is exceptional—the
    conversion elegantly reframes Hero''s Journey''s external adventure as internal
    emotional arc. Minor deduction (0.05) for ''journalism school ending'' being implied
    rather than explicit (college applications mentioned but not specifically journalism
    focus). Tone is consistently gentle, intimate, and emotionally true throughout—lyrical
    language (''slipped between shelves,'' ''stories die in silence,'' ''warm rain'')
    maintains vulnerability while avoiding sentimentality. Prose quality exceeds requirements.'
