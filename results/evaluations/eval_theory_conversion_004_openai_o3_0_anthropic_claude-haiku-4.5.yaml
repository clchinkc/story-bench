  evidence: "All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated: (1) You\u2014\
    opening library sanctuary; (2) Need\u2014unnamed desire to speak, fear of voice;\
    \ (3) Go\u2014bicycle ride to Bernard's porch; (4) Search\u2014five visits of\
    \ awkward interviews, learning to listen; (5) Find\u2014breakthrough moment of\
    \ silence and story-pouring; (6) Take\u2014town hall presentation, speaking publicly;\
    \ (7) Return\u2014autumn, senior year, ordinary life resumed; (8) Change\u2014\
    demonstrated through college essays, campus tours, reframed relationship with\
    \ silence. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting,\
    \ oral history program, Ms. Okafor (initiator), Bernard Park (key relationship),\
    \ social anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic Take beat),\
    \ Bernard's death and funeral (Return phase). Structural accuracy is exceptional\u2014\
    the conversion elegantly reframes Hero's Journey's external adventure as internal\
    \ emotional arc. Minor deduction (0.05) for 'journalism school ending' being implied\
    \ rather than explicit (college applications mentioned but not specifically journalism\
    \ focus). Tone is consistently gentle, intimate, and emotionally true throughout\u2014\
    lyrical language ('slipped between shelves,' 'stories die in silence,' 'warm rain')\
    \ maintains vulnerability while avoiding sentimentality. Prose quality exceeds\
    \ requirements."
