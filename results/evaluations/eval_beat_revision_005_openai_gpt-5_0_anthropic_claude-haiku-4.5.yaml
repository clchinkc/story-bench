  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive
    reasoning. The model accurately recognized all five key requirements were met:
    (1) follows major defeat (gallery closure), (2) protagonist isolated (dark apartment,
    unanswered calls), (3) genuine despair and reflection (sitting on floor, tears,
    guilt about broken promise), (4) no solutions present (pure wallowing), and (5)
    whiff of death element (hospice memory, mother''s passing). The model also correctly
    noted that the line about ''tomorrow'' preserves the wallow without premature
    breakthrough. The explanation demonstrates clear understanding of the Dark Night
    of the Soul beat definition and avoided the false positive of over-diagnosing
    problems in a well-executed segment. The reasoning was specific, referenced textual
    evidence, and aligned perfectly with the ground truth analysis.'
