  evidence: "The output includes 'Yuki immediately finding the data core or understanding\
    \ what happened (skips the search)' as a violation. While she finds the core,\
    \ the narrative emphasizes the struggle to get to it and the partial understanding\
    \ of what happened, rather than an immediate, effortless discovery. However, the\
    \ final sentence 'She had found exactly what she had come for. She just didn\u2019\
    t yet understand the cost.' leans a bit too close to 'finding' for this beat.\
    \ The word count is significantly over the limit."
