  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - Things going according to plan (mostly): The plan goes awry very quickly,
    not ''mostly'' according to plan.'
  - 'Beat 1 - Introduction of an unexpected complication (minor): The complication
    (the guard noticing the fake) is significant, leading to an immediate abort, not
    minor.'
  - 'Beat 2 - False victory: a key objective achieved: No false victory is achieved.
    The painting is swapped, but immediately detected, leading to the abort.'
  - 'Beat 2 - The nature of the heist changes (from simple theft to something more):
    While the mentor''s involvement changes things, the ''simple theft'' aspect is
    immediately undermined, not changed from a successful simple theft.'
  - 'Beat 3 - Team friction or trust issues surface: While Nikolai questions Miri''s
    choice, it''s not really ''friction'' or ''trust issues'' in the sense of a significant
    conflict within the team.'
  - 'Cross-beat constraint - Chekhov''s Gun: The ''maintenance grate above'' is mentioned,
    but it''s not clearly established during Fun and Games. Nikolai ''noted the ventilation
    layout while planting the replica'' is a retrospective explanation, not a setup.'
  - 'Word count: The output is significantly under the requested word count.'
