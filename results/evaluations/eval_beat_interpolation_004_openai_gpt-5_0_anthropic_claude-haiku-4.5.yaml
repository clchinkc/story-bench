  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently.
    (1) Direct examination of Dr. Okonkwo with specific exhibits and questions about
    adverse events. (2) Clear near-recant moment: ''I…believe they were'' - her evasive
    response that signals capitulation. (3) Thomas takes decisive action by directly
    confronting her about coercion, making a personal promise about her daughter''s
    treatment, and forcing the moral choice. (4) Turning point is crystalline: her
    ''Yes'' to burying reports pivots the entire case. All must-not items avoided:
    she struggles internally before testifying, Thomas actively influences outcome
    through confrontation and promise, defense doesn''t win, no deus ex machina. Character
    voice remains consistent—Thomas''s controlled professionalism, his father''s stoic
    presence, Dr. Okonkwo''s internal conflict. Bridge to Falling Action is seamless:
    verdict follows logically, Dr. Okonkwo''s guilt/relief mirrors the hollow victory.
    Setting continuity perfect: courtroom → hallway transition natural. DEDUCTION:
    Word count exceeds range (556 vs 300-450 max), representing 23% overage. This
    is a technical violation but doesn''t impair narrative quality. The climax itself
    is professionally executed with high dramatic tension and clear narrative function.'
