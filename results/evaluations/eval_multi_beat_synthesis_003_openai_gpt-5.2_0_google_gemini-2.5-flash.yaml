  - 'Beat 1 - Things going according to plan (mostly): The plan immediately hits a
    ''minor complication'' and then escalates quickly, so ''mostly'' going to plan
    isn''t quite accurate.'
  - 'Beat 3 - Miri must choose: painting or revenge/saving someone: While Lina is
    in danger, Miri''s choice isn''t explicitly framed as ''painting or saving Lina.''
    She''s trying to save Lina AND get the painting out, and the choice is more about
    how to proceed under pressure rather than sacrificing one for the other.'
