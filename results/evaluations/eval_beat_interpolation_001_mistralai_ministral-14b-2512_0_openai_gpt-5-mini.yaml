  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he provides practical tools (compass, satchel, sketch) and wisdom; Elena''s doubt
    softens toward reluctant acceptance; her librarian skills are explicitly framed
    as useful. None of the forbidden items occur (no instant hero turn, no mentor
    accompaniment/solutions, not in the forest, no sudden magical powers). Minor deduction
    to bridge_score (0.05) for a small abruptness in transitioning from the refusal
    scene to Elena ''waking'' and immediately going to the shop—effective but slightly
    brisk. Word count is invalid (495 words; required 200–350). No content continuity
    or character-consistency issues.'
