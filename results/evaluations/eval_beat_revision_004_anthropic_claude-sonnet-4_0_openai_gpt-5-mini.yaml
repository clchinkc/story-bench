  evidence: "The model clearly addressed the real flaw: replacing an info-dump with\
    \ a lived scene that shows Rachel's instincts (analyzing photos, noting blood-spatter\
    \ angles), her devotion to cold cases (files labeled 'COLD', early arrival), and\
    \ her partnership with James through natural dialogue and interaction. Sensory\
    \ details (fluorescent hum, steaming coffee, dust motes, October light) establish\
    \ setting. Required phrases/names ('Detective Rachel Torres', 'Detective James\
    \ Oyelaran', Sherlock, 'Tuesday morning in October') are preserved. Changes were\
    \ not minimal \u2014 the segment is effectively rewritten into an active scene\
    \ rather than surgically edited prose, and one preservation element (explicit\
    \ 'Queens' mention) was lost, hence deductions to minimal_change_score and preservation/beat\
    \ scores."
