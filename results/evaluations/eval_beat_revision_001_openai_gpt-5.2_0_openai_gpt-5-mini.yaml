  evidence: "The revision correctly identified and addressed the actual flaw: it turns\
    \ the Ordeal into an internal confrontation with Kira's guilt over her brother\
    \ (dragon taunts exploit that fear), includes a symbolic death/surrender (she\
    \ allows the memory to hit and nearly gives up), and a rebirth/transformation\
    \ (acceptance steadies her and enables victory). All four required elements (Shadow\
    \ Dragon antagonist, Kira with sword, brother's death reference, victorious outcome)\
    \ and the four required phrases are preserved verbatim or nearly so. Changes are\
    \ moderate rather than purely surgical\u2014the model expanded internal material\
    \ and added scenes to enact the psychological crisis. Note: word count exceeds\
    \ the specified 250\u2013400 range (invalid) and there's a minor grammatical blemish\
    \ retained in the preserved phrase: 'a earth-shaking roar.'"
