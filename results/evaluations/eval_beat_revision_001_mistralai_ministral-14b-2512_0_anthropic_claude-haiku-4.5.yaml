  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated
    The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis. The revision
    explicitly addresses all four actual flaws: (1) Dragon exploits Kira''s guilt
    over brother''s death—extensively woven throughout (''ghost of her brother''s
    voice,'' ''weight of memory,'' dragon''s taunts about unworthiness); (2) Death
    moment achieved—Kira experiences psychological death through overwhelming grief
    and self-doubt (''three times she was knocked down...by waves of grief''), reaching
    a nadir where she questions her worthiness; (3) Transformation occurs—she shifts
    from believing guilt is her failure to recognizing it as external fear (''fear
    could be cut down''); (4) Victory from insight—she defeats the dragon by understanding
    ''The dragon''s words had been a lie...fear, not failure.'' PRESERVATION: All
    4 required phrases present: ''Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm''
    (opening), ''The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning
    eyes'' (intact), ''You cannot defeat me, child,'' the dragon rumbled'' (preserved),
    ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar'' (ending). All 4 preserved
    elements maintained: Shadow Dragon, Kira with sword, brother''s death reference,
    victorious outcome. MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: While the diagnosis is correct,
    the revision is NOT minimally surgical—it''s a substantial expansion (500 vs 250-400
    words, exceeding upper bound by 25%). The model added extensive internal monologue,
    emotional processing, and thematic layers throughout rather than making targeted
    insertions. A minimal fix would have interwoven the guilt/fear elements more surgically
    into the existing battle structure. The rewrite is high-quality but violates the
    constraint to make ''MINIMAL modifications.'' QUALITY: Prose is strong, emotionally
    resonant, no new errors, thematic coherence excellent. The writing successfully
    transforms the beat but at the cost of constraint adherence.'
