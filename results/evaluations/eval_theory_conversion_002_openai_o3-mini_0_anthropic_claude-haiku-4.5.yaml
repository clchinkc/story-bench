  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World - opening pottery life, (2)
    Call to Adventure - elders'' request about spring, (3) Refusal of Call - hesitation
    and fear explicitly stated, (4) Meeting the Mentor - grandmother''s journal as
    guide, (5) Crossing Threshold - departure on three-day journey, (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies
    - natural world as both ally and critic during climb, (7) Approach to Inmost Cave
    - arrival at shrine ruins, (8) Ordeal - nighttime work by firelight, surrender
    of control, (9) Reward - vessel completion and transformation sealed, (10) Road
    Back - return journey with doubt temptations, (11) Return with Elixir - spring
    flows, village celebrates. MISSING: (12) Resurrection - no explicit final test/death-rebirth
    moment before return; the ordeal and return blend without a distinct resurrection
    beat where Maya faces ultimate challenge. PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact
    - Maya protagonist, pottery central, grandmother''s legacy woven throughout, mountain
    shrine journey detailed, dried spring as catalyst and resolution, surrender theme
    explicit (''let go of need to impose will''), transformation clear. STRUCTURAL
    ACCURACY: Strong adherence to monomyth structure with clear progression, though
    Resurrection beat lacks distinct separation from Ordeal/Road Back sequence. TONE:
    Excellent maintenance of quiet, meditative, transformative voice throughout -
    contemplative language (''moonlight spilled,'' ''mute language,'' ''gentle moment''),
    introspective pacing, spiritual resonance preserved from original.'
