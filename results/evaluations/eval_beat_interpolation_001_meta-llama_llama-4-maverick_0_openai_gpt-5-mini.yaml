  evidence: Missing reference to Elena's librarian skills as potentially useful (required
    element 4). The mentor provides wisdom but no explicit physical tools in this
    excerpt (though later beat mentions Marcus's gifts), so a small deduction to bridge_score
    for not explicitly introducing the parting gift here. All must-not conditions
    are avoided; character voices and setting continuity are consistent.
