  evidence: 'The model explicitly responded ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' and provided a
    clear explanation tying the segment to the Dark Night of the Soul beat: identified
    the gallery closure as the major defeat, noted Maya''s isolation and genuine despair,
    referenced the mother''s death/hospice memory as the ''whiff of death,'' and confirmed
    no solutions are presented. This aligns fully with the provided key requirements.'
