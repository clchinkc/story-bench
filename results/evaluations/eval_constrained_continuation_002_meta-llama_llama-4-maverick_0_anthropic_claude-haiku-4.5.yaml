  failed_constraints:
  - Word count is 442, below minimum of 450 (8 words short)
  analysis:
    beats_present_detail: Fun and Games (viral moment, crowd rush, working in sync)
      and Midpoint (false victory with raised stakes about scaling up) both clearly
      executed
    must_include_analysis:
      viral_moment: Present - Instagram post from drunk college kid goes viral, brings
        sudden crowd
      working_together: Present - Priya and Dev work in perfect sync, movements described
        as 'well-oiled machine'
      rival_competitor: Present - Smokey's BBQ Bonanza owner appears, creates tension
        and competitive dynamic
      midpoint_false_victory: Present - They sell out and celebrate success, but immediately
        face scaling challenge
      genuine_connection: Present - High-five, gratitude expressed, Dev's admiration
        for Priya, partnership focus (not romantic)
      complication_hint: Present - Scaling concerns raised, Dev hesitates, foreshadowing
        future problems
    tone_analysis: Upbeat energy maintained throughout (viral success, perfect sync,
      high-fives, celebration). Undercurrent of tension present but could be slightly
      stronger - the rival interaction is brief and the scaling concern feels somewhat
      muted. Overall tone execution is strong.
    ending_analysis: Excellently positioned at Midpoint. Apparent success clearly
      established (sold out, crowd dispersed, high-fives). Stakes raised effectively
      through scaling revelation and Dev's hesitation. Ends on note of celebration
      masking underlying tension - perfect Midpoint positioning.
    strengths:
    - All required beats present and well-executed
    - All 6 must-include elements seamlessly integrated
    - No forbidden elements present
    - Strong narrative momentum and pacing
    - Authentic character voices maintained from opening
    - Excellent Midpoint structure with false victory and raised stakes
    weaknesses:
    - Word count falls 8 words short of minimum requirement
    - Rival competitor interaction could be slightly more developed for greater tension
    - Tone could push the undercurrent of tension slightly harder
  overall_score: 0.92
  score_rationale: Exceptional execution of story structure and content requirements.
    All beats present, all must-includes delivered, all forbidden elements avoided.
    Tone is strong and ending perfectly positioned. Only minor deduction for word
    count shortfall (8 words) and slightly underdeveloped tension elements. This is
    professional-quality work that fully satisfies the creative brief.
