  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats present and clearly articulated: (1) You—opening
    establishes Zoe''s library comfort zone and voice anxiety; (2) Need—''Something
    was missing'' and her attraction to oral histories; (3) Go—Ms. Okafor''s challenge
    and Zoe accepting the program; (4) Search—''stumbled through interviews,'' learning
    to listen, five visits showing adaptation; (5) Find—Bernard''s breakthrough moment
    (''You''re the first person who ever asked the right questions''); (6) Take—town
    hall presentation where she publicly shares Bernard''s story; (7) Return—summer
    ends, life resumes, but she keeps visiting Bernard; (8) Change—journalism applications,
    funeral speech from her own perspective, final paragraph demonstrates transformed
    capability. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting,
    oral history program, Ms. Okafor (initiator), Bernard Park (key relationship),
    social anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic Take beat),
    Bernard''s death and funeral (Return/Change catalyst). Tone is consistently gentle,
    intimate, and emotionally true—lyrical without being overwrought (''disappearing
    into the quiet predictability,'' ''voices dried up,'' ''his eyes wet''). Minor
    deduction (0.05) for structural_accuracy: the narrative occasionally blends beats
    together rather than cleanly delineating them, though this actually enhances emotional
    flow. Tone deduction (0.05) minimal—maintains intimacy throughout with only slight
    variation in intensity.'
