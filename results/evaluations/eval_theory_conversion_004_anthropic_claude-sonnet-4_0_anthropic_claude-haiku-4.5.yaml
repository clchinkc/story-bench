  evidence: "All 8 Story Circle beats present and clearly articulated: (1) You\u2014\
    opening establishes Zoe's library comfort zone and voice anxiety; (2) Need\u2014\
    'Something was missing' and her attraction to oral histories; (3) Go\u2014Ms.\
    \ Okafor's challenge and Zoe accepting the program; (4) Search\u2014'stumbled\
    \ through interviews,' learning to listen, five visits showing adaptation; (5)\
    \ Find\u2014Bernard's breakthrough moment ('You're the first person who ever asked\
    \ the right questions'); (6) Take\u2014town hall presentation where she publicly\
    \ shares Bernard's story; (7) Return\u2014summer ends, life resumes, but she keeps\
    \ visiting Bernard; (8) Change\u2014journalism applications, funeral speech from\
    \ her own perspective, final paragraph demonstrates transformed capability. All\
    \ 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history\
    \ program, Ms. Okafor (initiator), Bernard Park (key relationship), social anxiety\
    \ (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic Take beat), Bernard's\
    \ death and funeral (Return/Change catalyst). Tone is consistently gentle, intimate,\
    \ and emotionally true\u2014lyrical without being overwrought ('disappearing into\
    \ the quiet predictability,' 'voices dried up,' 'his eyes wet'). Minor deduction\
    \ (0.05) for structural_accuracy: the narrative occasionally blends beats together\
    \ rather than cleanly delineating them, though this actually enhances emotional\
    \ flow. Tone deduction (0.05) minimal\u2014maintains intimacy throughout with\
    \ only slight variation in intensity."
