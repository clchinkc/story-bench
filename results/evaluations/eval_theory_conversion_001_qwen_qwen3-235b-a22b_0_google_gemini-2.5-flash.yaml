  evidence: All 5 Freytag's Pyramid beats are clearly present and distinct. All 6
    core elements from the original story are preserved. The word count is 500, which
    is valid. The structural accuracy is excellent, with a clear progression through
    the stages. The tone of medical thriller tension with ethical weight is perfectly
    maintained throughout the narrative.
