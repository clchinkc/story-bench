  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Maya
    discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability through his grandmother story and emotional
    opening; (2) relationship shifts from professional (contract focus) to personal
    (he shares intimately, she forgets the contract); (3) genuine connection established
    through shared meal and emotional vulnerability; (4) Maya makes explicit commitment
    choice (''She would stay. Not just for the money, but for this. For him.''). The
    beat perfectly executes Act 2 Midpoint function—raises emotional stakes, shifts
    Maya from reactive (taking job for money) to proactive (staying for him), represents
    point of no return in emotional journey. All must-not items avoided: no premature
    love declaration, no intimacy beyond forehead touch, no photograph during scene,
    Alejandro''s walls clearly lower. Character voices consistent—Alejandro''s rare
    softness contrasts his usual guardedness; Maya''s internal conflict between financial
    motivation and emotional connection rings true. Seamless bridge: BEFORE establishes
    her mercenary motivation and his reputation; GENERATED shows that motivation being
    superseded by genuine connection; AFTER reveals the consequence of that emotional
    commitment. Setting continuity perfect—villa dinner scene logically follows her
    employment, precedes the photograph scandal. Pacing and emotional arc are exemplary
    for this beat.'
