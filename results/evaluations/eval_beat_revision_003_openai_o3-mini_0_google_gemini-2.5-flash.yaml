  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to show
    Sophie''s transformation upon returning. It addressed all aspects of the required
    fix: Sophie responds differently to work stress, applies a specific lesson from
    the retreat (''choose when to answer it''), shows a behavioral marker of change
    (setting phone aside, new priorities), creates contrast, and implies her mother
    notices (through the ''calm conviction'' and ''newfound steadiness'' descriptions).
    The changes were surgical and focused on the flaw, preserving most of the original
    structure and dialogue.'
