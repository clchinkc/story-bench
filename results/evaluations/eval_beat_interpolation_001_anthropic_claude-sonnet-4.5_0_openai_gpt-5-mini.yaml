  evidence: All four required elements are present (Marcus introduced; gives practical
    wisdom/tools; Elena's doubt shifts toward reluctant acceptance; librarian skills
    referenced). No prohibited items appear (Elena is not suddenly confident or magical;
    mentor does not solve problems or accompany her; setting is a shop, not the forest).
    Character voices and continuity are consistent, and the scene cleanly sets up
    the threshold to follow.
