  evidence: 'All 12 Campbell beats are represented: Ordinary World (village), Call
    to Adventure (dry spring), Refusal (her hesitation), Meeting the Mentor (grandmother''s
    dream/journal), Crossing the Threshold (leaving for the mountain), Tests/Allies/Enemies
    (storm, treacherous path, fox ally), Approach to Inmost Cave (ruined shrine),
    Ordeal (surrendering control in the kiln), Reward (the realized vessel/knowing),
    The Road Back (heavy journey home), Resurrection (final test at the spring), and
    Return with the Elixir (Maya as keeper, new understanding). All 7 required elements
    are preserved (Maya, pottery, grandmother''s legacy, mountain shrine, dried spring,
    theme of surrender, Maya''s transformation). Minor, intentional deductions from
    perfect structural score because the mentor appears as a dream/journal rather
    than an in-person mentor and there is no personified antagonist—''enemies'' are
    environmental tests rather than a distinct adversary. Tone is very well maintained
    (quiet, meditative, transformative) with only a very small deduction for moments
    of slightly more literal narration.'
