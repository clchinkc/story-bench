  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-sequenced.\
    \ Exposition establishes Samira's 15-year reputation, lab sanctuary, and the impossible\
    \ protein discovery. Rising Action escalates through 72-hour containment chaos\
    \ and pathogen adaptation. Climax peaks with dual revelations: Nexus Biotech's\
    \ involvement AND their legal team arriving to suppress evidence\u2014creating\
    \ maximum tension. Falling Action executes the press conference gambit and immediate\
    \ consequences. Denouement provides new equilibrium (unemployment but moral victory).\
    \ All 6 core elements preserved: protagonist, engineered virus, Raj, Nexus antagonist,\
    \ public cure release, career sacrifice. Word count 678 is valid (500-700 range).\
    \ Tone maintains medical thriller tension throughout with ethical weight evident\
    \ in Samira's dilemma and final sacrifice. MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Structural accuracy\
    \ -0.05 because the transition between Rising Action and Climax could be slightly\
    \ sharper (the Nexus discovery feels slightly rushed). Tone -0.05 because one\
    \ phrase ('siren') is slightly poetic for the clinical thriller register, though\
    \ this is minimal. The conversion successfully transforms 3-act linear progression\
    \ into 5-act pyramid structure with enhanced dramatic architecture."
