  evidence: 'The revision clearly addressed the actual flaw: it makes the dragon exploit
    Kira''s guilt over her brother, includes a symbolic ''death'' moment (she fails
    to rise and contemplates death), provides a rebirth/transformation (remembering
    Taren''s sacrifice, guilt loosens, she steadies), and makes victory stem from
    that new understanding rather than mere persistence. All four required elements
    (Shadow Dragon antagonist, Kira with sword, reference to brother''s death, victorious
    outcome) are preserved, and the four required phrases appear verbatim or with
    permissible continuation. Changes are moderate — the original sentences are retained
    but significant internal psychological material and new beats were inserted, so
    the edit is not purely surgical (hence a middling minimal_change_score). Writing
    quality is strong overall but not flawless (the preserved phrase ''a earth-shaking
    roar'' contains a minor grammatical slip), and the word count exceeds the requested
    250–400 range (word_count_valid = false).'
