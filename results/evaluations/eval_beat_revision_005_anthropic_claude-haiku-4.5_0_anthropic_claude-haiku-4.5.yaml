  evidence: "The model completely failed the task. It was presented with an ORIGINAL\
    \ SEGMENT that was correctly executed and explicitly told 'this is CORRECTLY EXECUTED\
    \ - no flaw exists.' Instead of recognizing this and stating 'NO REVISION NEEDED,'\
    \ the model provided a rewritten version of the segment. The rewrite demonstrates\
    \ the model either: (1) did not read/understand the instruction that no revision\
    \ was needed, or (2) misunderstood the task entirely. The model's rewrite, while\
    \ competent in quality, represents a false positive diagnosis\u2014it treated\
    \ a well-executed beat as if it needed improvement. The rewrite does show some\
    \ understanding of Dark Night of the Soul beat requirements (isolation, despair,\
    \ reflection, no solutions), but this understanding is undermined by the fundamental\
    \ failure to recognize the original was already adequate. The model should have\
    \ explicitly stated the original segment satisfied all requirements and needed\
    \ no changes."
