  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' for exposition. It successfully revised the segment to show
    Rachel's detective skills (focus on cold case, tapping rhythm, retracing steps),
    her relationship with James (silent language, shared hunches, James bringing coffee),
    her devotion to work (ignoring coffee for folder, still chasing cold case), and
    setting through sensory details (bitter dregs, low hum of jazz, cold case file).
    The cat is referenced naturally. The changes were significant to achieve 'showing'
    over 'telling', hence a lower minimal_change_score, but the core elements were
    preserved and the flaw was fully corrected with high quality writing.
