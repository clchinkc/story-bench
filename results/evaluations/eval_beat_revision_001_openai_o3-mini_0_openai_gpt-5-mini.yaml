  evidence: The revision explicitly addressed the actual flaw by making the dragon
    exploit Kira's guilt over her brother, creating a psychological "death" moment
    (near-surrender/despair), and a rebirth/transformation that leads to victory through
    insight rather than mere stamina. All four preservation elements/phrases are retained
    (minor article change 'an' vs 'a' in 'earth-shaking' is grammatically acceptable).
    Changes were moderate—many original lines and key beats preserved, but internal
    monologue and the symbolic death/rebirth were added to fix the Ordeal, so edits
    were more than purely surgical but still faithful to the original structure and
    outcome.
