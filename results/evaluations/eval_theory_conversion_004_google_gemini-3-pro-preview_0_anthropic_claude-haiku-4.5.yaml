  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated: (1) You—opening
    establishes Zoe''s library sanctuary and emotional camouflage; (2) Need—hollow
    space, desire to be seen despite terror; (3) Go—accepts recorder, steps into Bernard''s
    living room; (4) Search—navigates awkwardness, learns to abandon index cards,
    discovers power of silence; (5) Find—breakthrough moment with Bernard''s Korea
    story, realizes listening is empathy; (6) Take—Town Hall presentation, speaking
    Bernard''s truth publicly despite terror; (7) Return—summer ends, library feels
    different, grief at Bernard''s death; (8) Change—funeral speech without notes,
    applies to journalism programs, demonstrates transformation. All 8 core elements
    preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history program, Ms. Okafor
    (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key relationship), social anxiety (threaded
    throughout), Town Hall presentation (climactic scene), Bernard''s death (emotional
    anchor), journalism school ending. Structure follows Harmon''s theory with smooth
    transitions between beats. Minor deduction (0.05) for structural_accuracy: the
    ''Take'' beat could be slightly more explicit about the ''price'' concept—while
    Town Hall is clearly costly emotionally, the framing emphasizes triumph over sacrifice.
    Tone is consistently gentle, intimate, and emotionally true throughout; internal
    monologue creates vulnerability; sensory details (dust-mote silence, driftwood,
    humidity) maintain intimacy. Minor deduction (0.05) for tone: one phrase (''aggressive
    empathy'') edges slightly toward analytical rather than purely intimate voice.'
