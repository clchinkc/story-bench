  evidence: 'The revision correctly diagnosed the missing ''Return (Having Changed)''
    beat and shows Sophie behaving differently: she cites a lesson from the retreat
    (''truly listen''), deliberately sets the phone aside instead of replying immediately,
    delays responding to Linda/the Pearson account, and views familiar landmarks with
    new eyes. Those actions demonstrate changed perspective and behavior. All four
    required elements and the four required phrases are preserved verbatim or nearly
    so. Changes are relatively surgical—new lines and subtle rewrites that integrate
    the lesson without discarding original structure. Minor shortcomings: the mother''s
    noticing of the change is implied rather than explicit, and one line about the
    Pearson account reads a bit awkwardly, so the fix is strong but not perfectly
    complete.'
