  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are clearly present and in order (Exposition:
    Samira and the anomalous virus; Rising Action: quarantine, escalating cases, discovery
    of Nexus; Climax: the Nexus confrontation/press conference and public release
    of the cure; Falling Action: immediate aftermath, Nexus scrambling, investigation;
    Denouement: outbreak controlled, Samira''s altered future). All six required elements
    are preserved (Samira, engineered virus discovery, Raj, Nexus Biotech, public
    release of the cure, Samira''s career sacrifice). Structure follows Freytag''s
    Pyramid closely and the medical-thriller tone with ethical weight is maintained,
    so no deductions were made.'
