  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw by turning the combat into an internal
    crisis: the dragon taunts Kira about her brother (exploiting her guilt), she experiences
    a collapsing/''death'' moment and despair, then a rebirth triggered by her brother''s
    remembered words, and victory comes from renewed understanding rather than mere
    endurance. All four required elements/phrases are present verbatim or nearly so.
    Changes were more than surgical edits (new internal beats, dialogue, and transformation
    added), so minimal_change_score is moderate.'
