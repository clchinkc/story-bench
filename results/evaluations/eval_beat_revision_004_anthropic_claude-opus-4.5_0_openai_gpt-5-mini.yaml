  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw (telling vs. showing) by converting
    the info-dump into a lived scene: sensory detail (gray sky, coffee, photos), action
    that reveals Rachel''s instincts (re-examining a surveillance still, handling
    files), and natural dialogue with James that establishes their working relationship.
    It also includes Sherlock and the Queens apartment and the October Tuesday timing,
    so the five story elements are preserved. However, the revision is a substantial
    rewrite rather than minimal surgical edits, and it failed to preserve three of
    the four required phrase fragments exactly (it included the time phrase but did
    not include the exact strings "Detective Rachel Torres", "Detective James Oyelaran",
    or the exact phrase "cat named Sherlock"). Overall writing quality is high with
    no new errors introduced.'
