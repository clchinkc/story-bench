  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: The Ordeal was executed\
    \ as a mere boss battle rather than a transformative psychological crisis. The\
    \ revision precisely addresses all four required corrections: (1) Dragon exploits\
    \ Kira's deepest fear by invoking her brother and weaponizing her guilt ('Your\
    \ fault, Your fault, Your fault'); (2) Clear 'death' moment where Kira symbolically\
    \ dies\u2014she lies on the ground suffocated by guilt, experiences internal collapse\
    \ ('something broke inside her'), and accepts her own death as inevitable; (3)\
    \ Transformation occurs through reframing: she shifts from fighting to prove herself\
    \ worthy to understanding that 'the choice to fight despite certain death\u2014\
    that was the victory'; (4) Victory emerges from new understanding (acceptance\
    \ and freedom from guilt) rather than mere persistence. All four required phrases\
    \ are preserved verbatim or near-verbatim: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across\
    \ the chasm,' 'The creature was massive\u2014twenty feet of obsidian scales and\
    \ burning eyes,' 'You cannot defeat me, child,' the dragon rumbled,' and 'The\
    \ Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar.' The setting, outcome, and\
    \ core elements remain intact. Changes were surgical but substantial\u2014approximately\
    \ 65% of original text was retained with targeted insertions of psychological\
    \ depth (dragon's dialogue about brother, internal monologue during the 'death'\
    \ moment, rebirth realization). The writing quality is exceptional with no new\
    \ errors; the prose is more sophisticated and emotionally resonant than the original.\
    \ The beat definition is satisfied comprehensively: confrontation with internal\
    \ fear (guilt), symbolic death (psychological collapse and acceptance), transformation\
    \ (shift in self-understanding), and victory through insight rather than strength."
