  evidence: The story successfully hits all 12 beats of the Hero's Journey and preserves
    all 7 core elements. The tone is perfectly maintained. The only minor structural
    issue is that the 'Refusal of the Call' and 'Meeting the Mentor' beats are somewhat
    intertwined and less distinct than they could be, but still present. The word
    count is slightly over the requested range.
