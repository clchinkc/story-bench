  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are clearly present and well-executed: (1) You—library
    comfort zone established in opening; (2) Need—craving connection despite anxiety
    articulated explicitly; (3) Go—leaves library with recorder for first interview;
    (4) Search—weeks of interviews, learning listening as courage; (5) Find—Bernard''s
    breakthrough revelation about Korea; (6) Take—town hall presentation where she
    takes responsibility; (7) Return—comes back to ordinary life, still visiting Bernard;
    (8) Change—demonstrated through journalism applications and newfound voice. All
    8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history program,
    Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key relationship), social anxiety
    (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic moment), Bernard''s death
    and funeral (emotional anchor), journalism school ending. Tone is consistently
    gentle, intimate, and emotionally true throughout—introspective without being
    melodramatic, hopeful without being saccharine. Minor deduction (0.05) from structural
    accuracy: the ''Return'' beat could be slightly more distinct as a separate phase
    rather than flowing into ''Change,'' though the narrative handles this gracefully.
    Minor deduction (0.05) from tone: one phrase (''comfort zones are prisons of their
    own making'') edges toward slightly more philosophical abstraction than the rest
    of the intimate voice, though it remains appropriate.'
