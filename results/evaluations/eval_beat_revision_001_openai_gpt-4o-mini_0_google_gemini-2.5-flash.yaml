  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The Ordeal
    as a mere boss battle and needed to incorporate internal conflict, a 'death' moment,
    and transformation. It introduced the dragon exploiting Kira's guilt, a moment
    of near despair/giving up, and a clear statement of transformation at the end.
    The changes were mostly surgical, adding internal monologue and dragon taunts
    to deepen the conflict. One required phrase was slightly altered ('a earth-shaking
    roar' became 'an earth-shaking roar'). The 'death' moment is more of a 'near-death
    of spirit' than a full symbolic death, but it's a significant improvement.
