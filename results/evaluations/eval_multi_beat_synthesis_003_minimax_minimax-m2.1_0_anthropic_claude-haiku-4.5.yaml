  failed_items:
  - Beat 1 - Humor/style moments are minimal; banter is present but underdeveloped
    compared to 'Ocean's Eleven' tone requirement
  - Beat 1 - 'Things going according to plan (mostly)' is stated but not demonstrated;
    we see setup but not execution
  - Cross-beat Chekhov's Gun - The earring camera and Dex's electronic hum are established
    but not paid off in subsequent beats; the ventilation shaft is mentioned but never
    used
  - Cross-beat Tonal Escalation - Tone shift from Beat 1 to Beat 2 is abrupt rather
    than graduated; playful confidence drops too sharply when Elena appears
  detailed_analysis:
    beat_1_fun_and_games:
      score: 0.75
      satisfied:
      - Crew skills showcased (Dex's electronics, Tasya's social engineering, Miri's
        planning)
      - Problem-solving demonstrated (security blindspots, access routes, timing)
      - Unexpected complication introduced (Elena's presence)
      gaps:
      - Humor is dry and sparse; lacks the witty banter and style promised by 'Ocean's
        Eleven meets art history' tone
      - Plan execution not shown—we see setup but the heist action itself is interrupted
        before it begins
      - Mostly-going-according-to-plan is stated as intent but not dramatized
    beat_2_midpoint:
      score: 0.85
      satisfied:
      - 'False victory: painting acquisition is ordered (objective achieved)'
      - 'Stakes raised: Elena''s blackmail threat (40M, crew exposure)'
      - 'Mentor revealed: Elena Vasquez identified as antagonist with full backstory'
      - 'Heist nature changes: from simple theft to survival/sacrifice scenario'
      - Party setting intensifies pressure (confined space, active threat)
      gaps:
      - None significant; this beat is well-executed
    beat_3_bad_guys_close_in:
      score: 0.8
      satisfied:
      - 'Security closing in: hunt begins, footsteps, urgency'
      - 'Team friction: Miri orders crew away despite their resistance'
      - 'Crew member in danger: Tasya and Dex are vulnerable if caught'
      - 'Miri''s choice: painting vs. crew safety (she chooses crew)'
      - 'Walls closing in: literal (corridor pursuit) and figurative (Elena''s trap)'
      gaps:
      - Security presence is implied but not viscerally shown; no guards, alarms,
        or active pursuit depicted
    chekhov_gun_analysis:
      score: 0.5
      established_details:
      - Earring camera/earbud (Beat 1)
      - Dex's electronic hum security override (Beat 1)
      - Ventilation shaft above desk (Beat 1)
      - Service corridor exit (Beat 1)
      payoff_in_beat_3:
      - Ventilation shaft mentioned but never used
      - Service corridor used but not as setup payoff—it's generic
      - Earring and earbud disappear from narrative
      - Electronic hum never deployed or referenced
      issue: Setup-to-payoff chain is broken; details feel abandoned rather than critical
    tonal_escalation_analysis:
      score: 0.7
      beat_1_tone: Confident, professional, controlled—but lacks playful humor
      beat_2_tone: Shock, betrayal, stakes spike—good escalation
      beat_3_tone: Danger and sacrifice—appropriate but tonal shift is jarring rather
        than graduated
      issue: Transition from Beat 1 to Beat 2 is too abrupt; confidence doesn't gradually
        erode, it collapses
    mentor_presence_analysis:
      score: 1.0
      beat_1: Elena absent/unknown—correct
      beat_2: Elena revealed as active antagonist with clear motivation—excellent
      beat_3: Elena is the immediate threat forcing Miri's choice—perfect escalation
    team_dynamics_arc:
      score: 0.85
      tasya_arc: Introduced as seeking approval → trusted with critical role → endangered
        by Miri's sacrifice. Arc is present and affects plot.
      dex_arc: Competent specialist → follows orders → implied vulnerability. Arc
        is minimal but functional.
      issue: Tasya's arc is stronger; Dex feels more functional than character-driven
    context_maintenance:
      protagonist: Miri's voice, skills, and moral complexity well-maintained
      setting: Monaco, yacht, Grand Prix—vivid and consistent
      tone: Ocean's Eleven comparison partially met; art history element present but
        underutilized; clever banter underdeveloped
      antagonist: Elena's reveal is powerful; her motivation (revenge + payment) is
        clear
    coherence:
      strengths:
      - Clear narrative progression across three beats
      - Miri's character arc (learning to trust) threads through
      - Elena's presence creates through-line
      weaknesses:
      - Abrupt tonal shifts disrupt flow
      - Established details (earring, hum, shaft) create loose ends
      - Beat 1 setup doesn't fully pay off in Beat 3
  summary: 'The story executes Beats 2 and 3 strongly, with Elena''s reveal and Miri''s
    sacrifice creating genuine stakes. However, Beat 1 underdevelops the heist action
    and humor, and the Chekhov''s Gun constraint is largely unmet—established details
    don''t become critical payoffs. The word count shortfall (635 vs. 700-1000) compounds
    these gaps. Tonal escalation is present but jerky. Overall: solid character work
    and high-stakes drama, but incomplete heist execution and broken setup-payoff
    chains.'
