  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment lacked the internal,
    transformative aspects of The Ordeal. It introduced Kira's guilt over her brother's
    death as the core fear, created a 'death' moment where hope and innocence were
    extinguished, and showed a rebirth/transformation through renewed determination
    and insight. The victory came from this new understanding and resolve, not just
    persistence. The changes were significant enough to address the flaw but still
    maintained much of the original structure and action. One required phrase was
    slightly altered ('earth-shaking roar' vs 'a earth-shaking roar').
