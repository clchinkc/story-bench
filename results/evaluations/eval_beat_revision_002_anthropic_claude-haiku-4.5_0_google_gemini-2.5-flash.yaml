  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to execute
    'All Is Lost' because Marcus still had options and support. The revision systematically
    removed all options (grant rejected, fundraiser cancelled), removed support systems
    (Denise leaving, wife leaving, daughter not answering), and introduced a 'whiff
    of death' (arrest of a program member, metaphorical death of his purpose). The
    changes were significant enough to achieve the beat, but the core premise and
    initial setup were preserved. The writing quality is excellent, and no new errors
    were introduced.
