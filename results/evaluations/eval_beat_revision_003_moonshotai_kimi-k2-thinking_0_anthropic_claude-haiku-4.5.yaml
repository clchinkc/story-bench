  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified the actual flaw—Sophie showed zero
    transformation and immediately reverted to workaholic patterns, making the journey
    meaningless. The revision directly addresses this by demonstrating behavioral
    change through: (1) Sophie resisting the phone impulse despite muscle memory,
    (2) Explicit integration of retreat teaching (''respond, don''t react''), (3)
    Physical marker of change (phone stays in bag unopened), (4) Clear contrast between
    old self (always living in tomorrow''s to-do list) and new self (inhabiting the
    present), (5) Mother noticing the difference (''That''s new''). PRESERVATION:
    All 4 required phrases present verbatim or near-exact: ''Sophie''s flight landed
    at O''Hare'' (exact), ''How was Thailand?'' her mother asked'' (exact), ''The
    familiar Chicago skyline appeared'' (exact), ''''It''s good to be home,'' she
    said'' (exact). All 4 story elements preserved: Sophie as protagonist, Thailand/meditation
    retreat journey, Return to Chicago with mother, work pressure (Pearson account/Linda
    still present but handled differently). MINIMAL CHANGES: Revision is surgical—original
    structure maintained through first exchange, then strategic insertions: phone-buzzing
    moment (new), meditation teaching integration (new), internal monologue about
    changed perspective (new), mother''s observation (new), final paragraph expansion
    on transformed perception (new). Approximately 60% of original text retained,
    40% added/modified—this is appropriate for fixing a structural beat failure while
    preserving narrative skeleton. QUALITY: Writing is polished, no errors introduced,
    prose quality elevated with sensory details (Willis Tower lights, neon sign buzzing)
    and metaphorical depth (''seen through clarified vision''). Beat execution now
    complete: Return shows physical return + clear transformation + behavioral proof
    + integrated learning + external validation.'
