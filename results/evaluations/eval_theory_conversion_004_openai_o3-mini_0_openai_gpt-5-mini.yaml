  evidence: "All eight Dan Harmon beats are clearly present and in appropriate sequence.\
    \ All eight required elements (Zoe protagonist, library/oral-history program,\
    \ Ms. Okafor, Bernard Park, Zoe's social anxiety, town-hall presentation, Bernard's\
    \ death, journalism application) appear and are integrated. No significant deductions\
    \ \u2014 the piece faithfully and cleanly maps the original monomyth to the Story\
    \ Circle with the requested gentle, intimate tone."
