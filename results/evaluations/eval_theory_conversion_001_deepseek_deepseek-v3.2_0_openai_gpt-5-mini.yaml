  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are present and clearly mapped: Exposition (Samira''s
    ordered world/status quo), Rising Action (containment, investigation, Nexus revealed),
    Climax (proof and confrontation with Nexus), Falling Action (press conference,
    cure release), Denouement (six-week aftermath/new equilibrium). All six required
    elements are preserved: Samira as protagonist, engineered virus discovery, Raj,
    Nexus Biotech antagonist, public release of the cure, and Samira’s career sacrifice.
    No notable deductions — structure, stakes, and medical-thriller/ethical tone are
    consistently maintained.'
