  evidence: 'All eight Dan Harmon beats appear in order and clearly mapped: You (comfort
    zone), Need (voice), Go (oral-history program/interviews), Search (learning to
    listen and adapt), Find (Bernard’s revelation), Take (town-hall presentation/risk),
    Return (back to library/funeral), Change (journalism application/lasting courage).
    All eight required elements are preserved: Zoe protagonist, library and oral-history
    program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard Park, Zoe’s social anxiety, town-hall presentation,
    Bernard’s death, and the journalism-school ending. Tone remains gentle, intimate,
    and emotionally true. No deductions applied.'
