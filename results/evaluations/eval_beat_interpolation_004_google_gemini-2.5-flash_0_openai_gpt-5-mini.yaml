  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: direct examination, a near-recant
    moment, Thomas takes deliberate action that influences her, and the truth is revealed
    as the turning point. None of the prohibited items occur (no passive Thomas, no
    deus ex machina, no simple unconflicted confession, no defense victory). Character
    behavior and setting remain consistent and the climax cleanly bridges to the falling
    action.'
