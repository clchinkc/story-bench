  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw (overly telling exposition) by converting
    summary into a lived scene: sensory detail (coffee, precinct sounds, jazz), an
    action that hints at instincts (surveying the bulletin board of cold cases), and
    a shown partner relationship (wordless nod with Detective James Oyelaran). It
    preserved the five required story elements (Rachel as detective, James, Sherlock,
    Queens apartment, Tuesday in October) but only three of four exact required phrases
    (''cat named Sherlock'' was paraphrased). The revision is more than a surgical
    edit (moderate rewrite) but succeeds at showing rather than telling, with only
    minor remaining tell-style lines.'
