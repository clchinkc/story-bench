  evidence: "All five Freytag beats are present and ordered: clear exposition of Samira's\
    \ world, rising action (investigation, quarantine, evolving pathogen, Nexus link),\
    \ climax (revelation and Nexus confrontation culminating in the decisive act),\
    \ falling action (press conference and immediate spread of the cure), and denouement\
    \ (six-week aftermath and new equilibrium). All six required elements are preserved:\
    \ Samira, the engineered virus, Raj, Nexus Biotech, public release of the cure,\
    \ and Samira's career sacrifice. Minor, subjective deduction in tone (0.05) for\
    \ occasional melodramatic phrasing and the climax and falling-action moments being\
    \ tightly adjacent\u2014effective but tightly compressed rather than more distinct\
    \ separations."
