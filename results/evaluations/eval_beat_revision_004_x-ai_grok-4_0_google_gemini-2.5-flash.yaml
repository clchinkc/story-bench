  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' and revised it to demonstrate Rachel's traits, relationships,
    and setting through action and dialogue. It successfully showed her detective
    skills (cold case, instincts), her relationship with James (dialogue, shared coffee),
    her devotion to work (cold case, broken engagement reference), and setting (Queens
    apartment, precinct buzz, October chill). The changes were extensive, essentially
    a rewrite, which is why minimal_change_score is low, but the fix is very effective.
    The word count is slightly over the requested range.
