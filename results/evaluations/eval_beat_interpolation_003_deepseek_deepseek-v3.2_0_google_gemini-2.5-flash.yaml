  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores crew quarters, medical
    bay, and hydroponics bay. She discovers clues like corrupted logs, energy spikes,
    and Commander Reyes''s notes. She encounters shimmering figures of crew members.
    She overcomes the challenge of the malfunctioning hydroponics bay with high CO2
    levels. All ''must not'' items were successfully avoided. The character remains
    consistent, and the bridge to the next beat is well-established with the convergence
    of anomalies leading her to Lab Seven. Setting continuity is perfectly maintained.'
