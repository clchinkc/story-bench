  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Marcus still had multiple
    viable options (fundraiser, grant, new location) and intact support systems, creating
    a ''setback'' rather than ''rock bottom.'' The revision systematically eliminates
    all escape routes: (1) Appeal/petition/judge ruling finalized, (2) Fundraiser
    canceled due to donor flight, (3) Grant rejected, (4) Board betrayal—Denise joins
    the developer, isolating Marcus professionally, (5) Wife''s ultimatum about losing
    the house creates personal/financial pressure. The ''whiff of death'' is multi-layered:
    loss of identity (15-year purpose), loss of community (kids'' voices fade as lights
    die), loss of support (Denise''s betrayal), and metaphorical death of his life''s
    work. All four required phrases preserved verbatim: ''Marcus stared at the eviction
    notice in his hands,'' ''Thirty days to vacate the community center,'' ''"There
    has to be something we can do," said Denise,'' and ''He rubbed his temples.''
    All four story elements preserved: Marcus as protagonist, community center setting,
    eviction crisis, Denise present throughout. Changes were surgical rather than
    wholesale—the model kept the opening, Denise dialogue, and basic structure while
    replacing the middle section''s false hope with cascading failures. The emotional
    arc now genuinely reaches despair. Minor: the final image (lights dying) is slightly
    more poetic than the original''s abrupt cut, but this enhances rather than violates
    the beat. Writing quality remains strong with no new errors.'
