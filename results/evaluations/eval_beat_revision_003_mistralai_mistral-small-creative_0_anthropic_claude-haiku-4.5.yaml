  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified the actual flaw—Sophie showed zero
    transformation and immediately reverted to workaholic patterns, making the journey
    meaningless. The revision directly addresses this by demonstrating behavioral
    change through: (1) Sophie consciously choosing NOT to respond to urgent work
    emails despite the pull, (2) explicit contrast (''A month ago, I would''ve already
    been typing a response''), (3) physical marker of change (phone deliberately put
    away), (4) insight application (''I think I need to be here first''), (5) mother''s
    visible surprise at the change. REQUIRED PHRASES: All 4 preserved exactly or near-exactly:
    ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare'' (present), ''How was Thailand?'' her mother
    asked'' (present), ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'' (present), ''''It''s
    good to be home,'' she said'' (present). PRESERVATION: All 4 story elements intact—Sophie
    as protagonist, Thailand/meditation retreat journey, Chicago return with mother,
    work pressure (Pearson account/Linda) now responded to differently. MINIMAL CHANGES:
    The revision is surgical rather than a complete rewrite. Core structure preserved:
    airport arrival → mother greeting → dialogue about trip → work intrusion → skyline
    appearance → closing line. Additions are targeted: the hesitation, the phone moment,
    the explicit contrast, the insight. Approximately 60% of original text remains;
    40% is surgical insertion of transformation markers. No new errors introduced.
    Writing quality maintained with improved emotional resonance and thematic coherence.
    Beat execution is nearly perfect—only minor note is that the ''price paid'' (what
    she sacrificed) could be slightly more explicit, but the revision strongly satisfies
    the Return (Having Changed) requirement.'
