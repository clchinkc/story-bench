  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: mentor Marcus is introduced;
    he provides practical wisdom and a tangible gift (worn leather notebook, and compasses
    present); Elena''s doubt shifts gradually toward reluctant acceptance (hesitant
    spark of resolve); her librarian skills are explicitly framed as useful. None
    of the forbidden items appear: Elena does not become immediately confident or
    eager, Marcus doesn''t solve her problems or offer to accompany her, the scene
    is set in Marcus''s curiosity shop (not the forest), and Elena does not discover
    magical powers. No deductions were necessary.'
