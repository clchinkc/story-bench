  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats are clearly present and well-executed.\
    \ Act 1 (Setup) establishes Kenji's loss, the letter, and his journey to Kyoto\
    \ with strong sensory detail. Act 2A (Rising Action/First Half) covers wedding\
    \ preparations and Haruki's mentorship, building emotional stakes. Act 2B (Rising\
    \ Action/Second Half) introduces the business temptation, Yuki's confrontation,\
    \ and Kenji's moral choice\u2014the true turning point. Act 3 (Resolution) delivers\
    \ the ceremony, reconciliation, and the bamboo shop denouement. All 8 core elements\
    \ are preserved: protagonist Kenji, lost career, estranged Yuki, Kyoto wedding,\
    \ Haruki, business deal temptation, theme of people over ambition, bamboo shop\
    \ ending. Tone is consistently quiet, meditative, with Japanese aesthetic (Shinkansen,\
    \ temple steps, Obon festival, uchikake, cicada song). The prose maintains restraint\
    \ and emotional depth throughout. DEDUCTIONS: Word count is 832, exceeding the\
    \ 550-750 range by 82 words (11% over). This is a minor violation but measurable.\
    \ Structural accuracy is near-perfect; the three-act framework is implicit rather\
    \ than explicitly marked, which is appropriate for literary fiction but slightly\
    \ less transparent than pedagogical clarity might demand. The midpoint (business\
    \ offer) and second plot point (Kenji's decline and apology) are present but could\
    \ be more sharply delineated for teaching purposes."
