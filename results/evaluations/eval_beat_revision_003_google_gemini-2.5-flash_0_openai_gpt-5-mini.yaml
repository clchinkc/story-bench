  evidence: 'The model appears to have addressed the actual flaw: Sophie previously
    showed no lasting change after the retreat. The revision corrects this by giving
    Sophie a different response to work (hesitating with the phone, putting it away,
    telling her mother the emails can wait), offering a clear behavioral marker of
    change (new habit of not immediately checking/answering emails), and noting an
    internal shift in perspective (seeing the city differently, choosing to be present).
    The mother also notices the phone''s brief appearance, fulfilling the requirement
    that someone observe the change. Changes were minimal and surgical: core sentences
    and scene structure remain intact while inserting a few lines and altering Sophie''s
    immediate reactions to demonstrate transformation. Overall the beat is well executed
    and writing quality is good.'
