  evidence: The 'Find' beat feels a little early, as the true 'Find' (understanding
    the importance of connection and bearing witness) happens after the 'Search' (learning
    to interview). The 'Take' beat (town hall presentation) is well-placed as the
    'pay price' for her growth. The 'Return' and 'Change' are clearly delineated and
    effective.
