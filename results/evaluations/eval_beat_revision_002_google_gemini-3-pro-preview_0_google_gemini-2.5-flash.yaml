  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true 'All Is Lost' moment. It addressed the flaw by systematically removing
    Marcus's options (fundraiser, grant), isolating him (wife leaving, Denise leaving),
    and creating a 'whiff of death' (loss of family, purpose, and support system).
    The changes were significant enough to fix the flaw but still maintained the core
    setup and characters, indicating a good balance between fixing the problem and
    preserving the original structure. The writing quality is excellent, effectively
    conveying the despair required for the beat.
