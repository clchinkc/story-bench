  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed all aspects of the 'All Is
    Lost' flaw. It eliminated all remaining options (fundraiser failed, grant denied),
    removed support systems (Denise leaves, board resigns, wife leaves), created a
    sense of genuine hopelessness, and introduced a strong 'whiff of death' (loss
    of purpose, marriage, financial security). The changes were significant but necessary
    to achieve the beat's requirements, making it a moderate rather than minimal change.
    All required phrases and preserved elements are present.
