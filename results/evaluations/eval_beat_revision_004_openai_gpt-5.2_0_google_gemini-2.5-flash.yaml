  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed all aspects of the 'telling
    vs. showing' flaw. It transformed the summary into a vivid scene, revealing character
    traits, relationships, and setting through action, dialogue, and sensory details.
    The changes were extensive, resulting in a complete rewrite rather than minimal
    edits, which is appropriate given the nature of the flaw. All required elements
    and phrases were preserved.
