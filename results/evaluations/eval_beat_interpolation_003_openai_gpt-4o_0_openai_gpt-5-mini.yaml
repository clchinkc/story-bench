  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas
    (medical bay, crew quarters, hallways), discovers clues (overturned equipment,
    holo-log mentioning molecular phase shift), encounters transformed crew as mysterious
    shimmers/whispers, and overcomes an obstacle (locked/slammed door requiring scanner
    recalibration). None of the prohibited items occur (she doesn''t immediately find
    the data core, isn''t given a full explanation by the crew, doesn''t decide to
    leave, and didn''t already know about the transformation). Setting and character
    behavior remain consistent, and the Search segment naturally leads into the subsequent
    Find beat.'
