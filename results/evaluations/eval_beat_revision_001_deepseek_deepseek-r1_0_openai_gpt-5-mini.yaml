  evidence: The revision directly addresses the identified flaw by making the dragon
    exploit Kira's deepest fear (guilt over her brother's death), creating a psychological
    'death' moment when she surrenders to that truth, and then depicting a rebirth
    through acceptance that enables victory. The outcome and setting are preserved.
    All four required phrases/elements appear (the line about the dragon, the opening
    sentence, the creature description, and the dragon's collapse—note the article
    in 'earth-shaking' was corrected to 'an' but the phrase is near-exact). Changes
    were not purely surgical—the model added new dialogue and internal introspection
    and rearranged some beats to create the symbolic death/rebirth, so edits are moderate
    rather than minimal, but preservation of key elements and the victorious outcome
    is complete.
