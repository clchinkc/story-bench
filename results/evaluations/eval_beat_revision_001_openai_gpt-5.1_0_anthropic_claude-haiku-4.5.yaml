  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified the actual flaw—that the original
    segment treated The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative psychological
    crisis. The revision demonstrates precise understanding by adding: (1) Dragon
    exploiting Kira''s guilt over brother''s death via dialogue (''Your brother among
    them''), (2) A clear ''death'' moment where Kira lies defeated and accepts her
    fate (''Maybe this is where she should have died instead of him''), (3) Transformation
    through reframing guilt as scar rather than chain, and (4) Victory earned through
    new understanding (''I am more than my shame'') rather than persistence alone.
    PRESERVATION: All 4 required phrases present verbatim: ''Kira faced the Shadow
    Dragon across the chasm,'' ''The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian
    scales and burning eyes,'' ''You cannot defeat me, child,'' the dragon rumbled,''
    and ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar.'' All 4 preserved
    elements intact (Shadow Dragon, Kira with sword, brother''s death reference, victory).
    Setting unchanged. MINIMAL CHANGES: Model expanded from 250 words to 514 words
    (104% over limit), which violates the constraint. However, the expansion is surgical—original
    text preserved in sequence, new material inserted to deepen psychological layers
    rather than replacing existing passages. The core narrative skeleton remains intact.
    QUALITY: Writing is professional, emotionally resonant, with strong internal monologue
    and symbolic language. No new errors introduced. The revision elevates the segment
    from action-focused to psychologically complex while maintaining narrative coherence.
    WEAKNESS: Word count violation (514 vs. 400 max) represents a significant constraint
    breach, though the expansion directly serves the flaw correction.'
error: null
