  evidence: "All eight Harmonian beats are present and clearly mapped. All eight required\
    \ elements are preserved. Small deduction from structural_accuracy_score because\
    \ the 'Take' beat (the price paid) is portrayed mainly as overcoming fear rather\
    \ than a distinct tangible sacrifice, and the 'Return' reintegration is slightly\
    \ understated rather than deeply examined\u2014these are minor and do not undermine\
    \ the structure or emotional truth."
