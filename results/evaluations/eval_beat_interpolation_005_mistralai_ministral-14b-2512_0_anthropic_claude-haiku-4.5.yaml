  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Maya
    discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability through the kitchen scene, scars, and his
    reaching for the sacred ''98 wine; (2) relationship shifts from professional/contractual
    to deeply personal through the intimate kitchen moment; (3) shared moment of genuine
    connection via the lemon story and blood-tasting ritual; (4) Maya explicitly commits
    beyond the contract (''Not for the salary...For this''). The beat perfectly executes
    the Midpoint function—raising emotional stakes, shifting Maya from reactive (surviving
    6 months) to proactive (choosing to stay for him), and creating a point of no
    return in her emotional journey. Character voice is consistent and intimate. Bridge
    between BEFORE and AFTER is seamless—the photograph revelation directly follows
    this commitment moment, making the stakes devastatingly clear. Setting continuity
    is perfect (kitchen→study). VIOLATION: The blood-tasting ritual (''he lifted her
    wrist, his breath hot against her skin as he licked the blood away'') crosses
    into ''overly intimate'' territory, approaching the ''already in love'' threshold.
    While not a full violation, it''s borderline excessive for a Midpoint that should
    establish connection without premature physical intimacy. WORD COUNT: Exceeds
    range by 298 words (748 vs. 300-450 max), though content quality justifies the
    expansion.'
  overall_assessment: Exceptional execution of the Act 2 Midpoint beat with only minor
    calibration issues. The scene masterfully establishes vulnerability, shifts the
    dynamic, and commits Maya emotionally. The one violation is the intensity of physical
    intimacy, which slightly overshoots the 'connection' mark into 'already intimate'
    territory. Word count excess is notable but content-driven rather than padded.
