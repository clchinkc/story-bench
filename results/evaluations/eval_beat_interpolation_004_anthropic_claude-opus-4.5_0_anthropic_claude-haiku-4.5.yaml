  evidence: "All four required elements present and executed excellently: (1) Direct\
    \ examination occurs with specific question about documents; (2) Clear near-recant\
    \ moment where Dr. Okonkwo begins to backtrack ('may have misinterpreted,' 'could\
    \ be misleading'); (3) Thomas takes decisive action by revealing knowledge of\
    \ her daughter's situation and making a binding promise ('I will find another\
    \ way'), directly influencing her decision; (4) Turning point clearly marked when\
    \ she commits to truth ('They told me to bury it') and produces the flash drive.\
    \ All must-not items avoided: she struggles internally before testifying, Thomas\
    \ actively influences outcome through empathetic pressure rather than passive\
    \ questioning, defense doesn't win, no external deus ex machina (the flash drive\
    \ was already in her possession, not newly discovered). Character voice remains\
    \ consistent\u2014Thomas shows both prosecutorial skill and moral complexity.\
    \ Bridge between beats seamless: climax ends with verdict setup, falling action\
    \ begins with verdict delivery. Setting continuity perfect: courtroom \u2192 hallway\
    \ progression is natural and expected. The narrative executes the climax beat's\
    \ core function flawlessly: highest tension, protagonist's decisive action, irrevocable\
    \ turning point."
