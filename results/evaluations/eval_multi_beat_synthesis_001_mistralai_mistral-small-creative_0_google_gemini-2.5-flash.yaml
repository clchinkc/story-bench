  - 'Beat 1 - Revelation of an enemy within the Resonant community (a traitor): The
    killer is revealed to be the man who sold his sister the bad batch, not explicitly
    a ''traitor'' within the Resonant community itself, though he targets Resonants.'
  - 'Beat 2 - Dante and his new ally plan how to confront the killer: There is no
    planning scene with Lila. She gives him instructions, but it''s not a collaborative
    ''plan''.'
  - 'Beat 2 - Preparation scene—gathering tools, information, or courage: Dante doesn''t
    gather tools or information; he''s given the dampener and sent in.'
  - 'Beat 3 - Ally Continuity: The ally (Lila) is not present in the confrontation
    (Beat 3) until after the ordeal is over. She appears in the doorway at the very
    end.'
