  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: the original segment was
    pure exposition-through-telling (info-dump style with ''She was known for,'' ''She
    enjoyed,'' ''She had never married''). The revision transforms this into SHOWN
    exposition through grounded scene and action. Key corrections: (1) Rachel''s detective
    instincts revealed through her analyzing the fire escape shadow mismatch—characteristic
    behavior, not summary; (2) Partnership with James demonstrated through natural
    dialogue (''Black,'' ''Your dots are creeping,'' ''Stop reading over my shoulder'')
    and synchronized workflow, not stated as ''mutual respect''; (3) Devotion to cold
    cases shown through her working with the Cold case files, the cat on the banker''s
    box, her reluctance to close the drawer; (4) Setting established through sensory
    details (jazz crackling, lukewarm coffee, fluorescents buzzing, red dots on crime
    board, phones trilling) rather than ''She lived alone in a small apartment'';
    (5) Cat Sherlock integrated naturally into the scene, not mentioned as adopted
    fact. All 4 required phrases present: ''Detective Rachel Torres,'' ''Detective
    James Oyelaran,'' ''cat named Sherlock,'' ''Tuesday morning in October.'' The
    changes were surgical—the original''s entire structure was replaced with scene-based
    narrative, but no character names, roles, or core elements were altered. The final
    line ''It was a Tuesday morning in October when everything changed'' preserves
    the timing while signaling the inciting incident. Writing quality is professional
    with strong sensory language and natural dialogue. Minor deduction (0.15 on minimal_change_score)
    because this required substantial structural rewrite rather than surgical edits,
    though the rewrite was necessary and appropriate given the severity of the original
    flaw.'
