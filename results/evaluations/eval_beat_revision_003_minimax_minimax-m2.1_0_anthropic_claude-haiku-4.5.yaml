  evidence: 'Model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation
    and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.
    The revision fixes this precisely by: (1) inserting a hesitation moment that reveals
    internal conflict, (2) explicitly contrasting old vs. new behavior (''In the past,
    she would have called Linda immediately...The old Sophie would have been already
    typing''), (3) showing changed action (putting phone away instead of typing),
    (4) demonstrating the mother''s surprise (external validation of change), (5)
    integrating the meditation insight (''something quieter that she''d found in those
    silent rooms''), and (6) ending with philosophical reflection on integration (''Life
    went on. But so, it seemed, did she.''). All 4 required phrases preserved exactly:
    ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare'', ''How was Thailand? her mother asked'',
    ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'', ''It''s good to be home, she said''.
    Changes were surgical: added ~80 words of internal reflection and contrast within
    the existing structure rather than rewriting. No new errors introduced. The revision
    transforms a flat return into a genuine beat that demonstrates transformation
    through choice, behavior, and integrated wisdom.'
