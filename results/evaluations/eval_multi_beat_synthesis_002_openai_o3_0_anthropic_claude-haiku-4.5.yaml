  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - Internal shift incomplete: While Amara transitions from servant to active
    resistance, the internal psychological shift is somewhat muted. The narrative
    tells us ''she ceased being a silent household shadow'' but shows limited internal
    conflict or hesitation about this transformation. The shift feels more external/situational
    than deeply internalized.'
  strengths:
  - 'Beat 1 (5/5): Exceptional execution. Clear threshold crossing at Cape Coast jetty
    with point of no return (''no returning''). Immediate danger (checkpoint). Wit-based
    survival (language switching, manifest error). Identity shift explicitly stated
    though could be deeper internally.'
  - 'Beat 2 (5/5): Kweku encounter perfectly embodies uncertain ally. Test of commitment
    shown through ferry confrontation and choice to continue alone. Enemy obstacle
    (search party). Languages crucial to survival (Hausa, Twi, English). New intelligence
    learned (stronghold relocation).'
  - 'Beat 3 (5/5): Stronghold approach clear. Preparation/steeling evident (''desperation
    steadied her voice''). Recognition of cost shown through Kweku''s sacrifice and
    her acceptance of it. Final obstacle (guards demanding writ). Thematic element:
    knowledge as blade, not shield—resistance through intellectual ownership.'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun (1.0): Language skills demonstrated in Beat 1 (German with missionary,
    Fante with sergeant) become the decisive factor in Beat 3 (reciting letter in
    German, English, Twi to prove authenticity to guards).'
  - 'Identity Transformation (1.0): Beat 1—''shy servant'' persona maintained. Beat
    2—''You speak Hausa too?'' marks realization of capability. Beat 3—''she was its
    author, the ink of her memory'' shows full claim to resistance fighter identity.'
  - 'Escalating Danger (1.0): Beat 1—threat of discovery at checkpoint. Beat 2—direct
    confrontation with search party. Beat 3—active pursuit with gunfire and imminent
    capture.'
  - 'Thematic Thread (1.0): Knowledge as resistance woven throughout. Beat 1: copying
    letter to memory, ''walking book no patrol could burn.'' Beat 2: translating orders,
    demonstrating linguistic mastery. Beat 3: reciting letter verbatim as proof of
    authority.'
  - 'Context Maintenance: Protagonist voice authentic. Setting vivid (Cape Coast jetty,
    forest, mine shafts). Tone perfectly balanced between historical detail and anti-colonial
    resistance themes. Dignity in defiance evident throughout.'
  - 'Prose Quality: Exceptional. ''The sea wind faded. Bush smells—earth, palm wine,
    sweat—rose around her.'' Sensory immersion. Dialogue natural and revealing. Pacing
    accelerates appropriately through beats.'
  minor_observations:
  - The internal monologue in Beat 1 could have shown more hesitation or fear to deepen
    the psychological transformation, though the external markers are clear.
  - Kweku's character is well-developed but brief; his sacrifice in Beat 3 lands emotionally
    because of Beat 2 foundation.
  - The final line 'Knowledge...was a blade, and she had learned to swing it' provides
    thematic closure while maintaining ambiguity about what comes next—appropriate
    for this narrative moment.
  overall_assessment: This is a strong, well-crafted narrative that satisfies nearly
    all requirements with sophistication. The story demonstrates mastery of the Hero's
    Journey structure while maintaining historical authenticity and thematic coherence.
    The single minor gap (internal psychological depth in Beat 1's identity shift)
    is offset by exceptional execution of cross-beat constraints and prose quality.
    The narrative successfully transforms Amara from servant-scholar to active resistance
    fighter while using her multilingual intelligence as both plot device and thematic
    anchor.
