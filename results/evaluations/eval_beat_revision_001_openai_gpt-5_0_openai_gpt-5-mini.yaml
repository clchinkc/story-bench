  evidence: 'The revision explicitly addresses the identified flaw by making the dragon
    exploit Kira''s guilt over her brother, creating a psychological confrontation,
    a symbolic death (she kneels and ''lets the guilt crest through her''), and a
    rebirth/transformation (rises without the tremor, declares a new truth) that leads
    to victory through insight rather than mere persistence. The model correctly diagnosed
    the missing elements and implemented them. Changes are moderate rather than strictly
    surgical: key original lines and outcome are preserved verbatim, but significant
    internal material and thematic framing were added to fulfill The Ordeal requirements.'
