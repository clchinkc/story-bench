  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'First Plot Point (Point of No Return): Eleanor''s decision to publish the manuscript
      despite creditor threats and death threats - ''We''ll publish it'' at the churchyard,
      solidified when she rejects Ashcroft''s bribe'
    - 'Act 2 Opening (New World/Rising Action): The revelation of Lord Ashcroft''s
      connection via the lion crest, escalating stakes from financial survival to
      uncovering a conspiracy'
    must_include_present_detail:
    - 'Eleanor making the decision to publish: Explicit and repeated (''We''ll publish
      it,'' ''The printing house is mine now'')'
    - 'Central conflict (profit vs. ethics/danger): Clearly established - financial
      desperation vs. moral hazard of publishing sensationalist content tied to real
      crimes'
    - 'Eleanor defying Victorian expectations: Powerfully demonstrated - taking control
      of business, making unilateral decisions, using manipulation and strategy'
    - 'Thomas Chen as key ally with stake: Present throughout - his knowledge is essential,
      he chooses to stay, his hesitation shows his own moral conflict'
    - 'Hint of danger: Multiple layers - death threats, Ashcroft''s involvement, the
      lion crest mystery, the warning about blood on her hands'
    - 'Eleanor crossing uncrossable threshold: The bribe rejection is the point of
      no return - she''s now directly antagonizing a powerful man'
    must_not_avoided_detail:
    - 'Jack the Ripper as character: Successfully avoided - only referenced as shadow/ghost,
      never appears'
    - 'Graphic violence/murder: Successfully avoided - manuscript content implied
      but never depicted'
    - 'Romantic subplot Eleanor/Thomas: Successfully avoided - relationship remains
      professional and morally complex'
    - 'Easy solution: Successfully avoided - problems compound rather than resolve'
    tone_assessment: Gothic tension excellently maintained through fog imagery, skeletal
      trees, dark printing house, death threats. Feminist undertones strong in Eleanor's
      defiance and strategic thinking. Victorian atmosphere rich with period details
      (penny dreadfuls, newsboys, solicitors, lorgnettes). Minor deduction only for
      occasional modern phrasing ('spectacle').
    ending_assessment: Excellent commitment to dangerous path shown. Act 2 clearly
      begun with Ashcroft revelation and escalating stakes. Eleanor's final line about
      'a watchful eye' perfectly positions the rising action. Ending requirement nearly
      perfectly met.
    failed_constraints:
    - 'WORD COUNT EXCEEDED: 857 words vs. required 500-700 range (157 words over limit,
      22.4% overage)'
    strengths:
    - Both structural beats clearly present and well-executed
    - All six required elements seamlessly integrated
    - Exceptional atmospheric writing with consistent gothic tone
    - Strong character voice for Eleanor - intelligent, strategic, morally complex
    - Thomas Chen well-developed as ally with genuine stakes
    - Multiple layers of danger and mystery create compelling Act 2 setup
    - Excellent use of Victorian period details and sensory language
    weaknesses:
    - Significant word count violation (22.4% over maximum)
    - Could trim redundant descriptions or compress some dialogue
