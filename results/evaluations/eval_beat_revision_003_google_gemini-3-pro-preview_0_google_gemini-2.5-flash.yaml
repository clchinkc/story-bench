  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie not showing
    change upon return. It introduced a clear contrast between her old reaction to
    work stress and her new, calmer response, directly applying a lesson from the
    retreat. The changes were surgical, adding internal monologue and new actions
    (turning off the phone) to demonstrate the transformation, while preserving the
    core structure and elements of the original segment.
