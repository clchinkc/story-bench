  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Maya learns a vulnerable fact
    (Alejandro''s memory loss), their relationship shifts from professional to personal
    (shared hand-holding and invitation to dine together), there is a concrete shared
    moment (cooking through the night, his emotional reaction), and Maya makes an
    explicit choice that deepens commitment (''This isn''t about the contract'' and
    reaching for his hand). None of the forbidden items appear: they''re not already
    in love or overly intimate, Maya does not decide to leave or breach the contract,
    no photograph is taken in this scene, and Alejandro does lower his guard rather
    than remain closed off. Character behavior and voice remain consistent with the
    setup and the scene cleanly bridges the End of Act 1 to the Midpoint, setting
    up later stakes and the subsequent All-Is-Lost moment. No continuity issues detected.'
