  evidence: 'All four required elements present: (1) Marcus introduced as mentor character
    with clear wisdom-keeper role in curiosity shop; (2) practical wisdom provided
    (''doubt can be a compass'') and tangible tool given (leather-bound journal);
    (3) Elena''s doubt shifts toward reluctant acceptance (''Perhaps she could be
    more than just ordinary, after all''); (4) librarian skills explicitly reframed
    as valuable asset (''Your knowledge of stories, of histories, is a powerful tool'').
    All must-not violations avoided: Elena remains doubtful and reluctant throughout,
    Marcus does not accompany her or solve problems, setting is the curiosity shop
    (not forest), no magical powers discovered. Character voice consistent—Elena defensive
    and self-deprecating, Marcus warm and enigmatic. Bridge seamless: BEFORE ends
    with Elena refusing the call; GENERATED shows her returning to seek guidance;
    AFTER shows her at forest threshold with Marcus''s gifts, creating natural progression.
    Continuity perfect: journal and compass from Generated appear in After, location
    transitions logically from shop to forest edge, emotional arc maintains momentum.'
