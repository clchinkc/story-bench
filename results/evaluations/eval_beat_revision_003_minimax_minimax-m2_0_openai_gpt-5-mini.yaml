  evidence: "The model targeted the correct flaw (lack of demonstrated change on Return)\
    \ and shows Sophie altering her behavior: she sets the phone face-down, powers\
    \ it off, and decides to delay work\u2014explicitly invoking her meditation insight\
    \ ('it can wait'). These are minimal, surgical edits that preserve the original\
    \ structure, characters, and work-pressure element. Missing: an explicit moment\
    \ where the mother notices Sophie's change and the integration is concise rather\
    \ than deeply developed, so the fix is strong but not fully exhaustive."
