  evidence: All five Freytag beats are present (exposition, rising action, climax,
    falling action, denouement). All six core elements are preserved (Samira, engineered
    virus, Raj, Nexus, public cure release, Samira's career sacrifice). Minor deduction
    from perfect structural score because the revelation and the public confrontation
    blur the boundary between climax and falling action—the text places the internal
    turning-point (the decision/revelation) just before the public showdown, so the
    peak tension is split across two paragraphs rather than concentrated in a single,
    discrete moment. Slight tone deduction because while the medical-thriller tension
    and ethical weight are strongly maintained, a small portion leans toward heroic-cinematic
    resolution (rapid public broadcast and neat legal aftermath) rather than sustaining
    murkier ethical ambiguity typical of darker medical thrillers.
