  evidence: 'REQUIRED ELEMENTS (4/4 present): (1) Multiple station areas explored
    - crew quarters, mess hall, corridors, bio-labs, Lab 4, Lab 7 with progressive
    discovery; (2) Clues discovered systematically - abandoned meal, chess game, scattered
    personal effects, frantic log entry about ''phase shifts'' and ''dimensional bleed-through'';
    (3) Mysterious encounter with transformed crew - heat haze distortions, peripheral
    movement, whispers, Reyes''s flickering voice; (4) Obstacle overcome - locked
    Lab 7 door requiring maintenance panel bypass with scanner energy pulse. MUST-NOT
    ITEMS (0/4 violations): Data core NOT immediately found (discovered only in AFTER
    section); crew does NOT explain everything upfront (only cryptic whispers and
    final message); Yuki does NOT abandon mission; dimensional transformation remains
    mysterious during Search phase. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Yuki maintains professional
    composure, scientific curiosity, and determination throughout. Her progression
    from confusion to focused investigation is authentic. BRIDGE QUALITY: Seamless
    transition from ''Go'' (arrival) to ''Search'' (exploration) to ''Find'' (discovery).
    Each section builds logically. CONTINUITY: Setting details consistent - red emergency
    lighting, recycled oxygen smell, Jupiter viewport, station layout. No contradictions
    between sections. EXECUTION: Perfectly executes the Search beat''s narrative function
    - active exploration, incremental discovery, mounting tension, obstacles requiring
    problem-solving, mystery deepening rather than resolving.'
