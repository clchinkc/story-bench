  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive
    reasoning. The model accurately recognized all five key requirements were satisfied:
    (1) follows major defeat (gallery closure), (2) protagonist isolated (dark apartment,
    unanswered calls), (3) genuine despair demonstrated (sitting on floor, tears,
    triple failure recognition), (4) no solutions presented (wallowing phase), and
    (5) whiff of death element present (hospice memory, mortality reflection). The
    model demonstrated strong beat understanding by explaining why each element works
    and avoided the false positive of over-diagnosing problems. The explanation was
    detailed, accurate, and showed clear calibration to the Dark Night of the Soul
    definition provided.'
