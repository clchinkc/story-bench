  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the 'telling vs. showing'
    flaw in the original exposition. It transformed summary into a scene, introducing
    Rachel through her actions (cradling coffee, musing to Sherlock), showing her
    relationship with James through dialogue and interaction, and hinting at her devotion
    to work through her thoughts about cases. Setting is established with sensory
    details (morning light, rich aroma, buzzing precinct). The changes were significant,
    essentially a rewrite of the segment, hence a lower minimal_change_score, but
    this was necessary to fix the fundamental flaw. The quality of the writing is
    good, and no new errors were introduced. All required preserved elements and phrases
    are present.
