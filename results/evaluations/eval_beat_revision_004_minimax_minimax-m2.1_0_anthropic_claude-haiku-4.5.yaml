  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—that the original
    was pure exposition-as-summary (telling) rather than exposition-as-scene (showing).
    The revision transforms the segment into a lived moment with sensory grounding,
    action, and natural character revelation. FLAW CORRECTION: Excellent execution.
    The revision shows Rachel''s detective instincts through her reading of precinct
    atmosphere (''she knew which desks held restless energy''), her devotion to cold
    cases through her 7:12 AM arrival with case file, her partnership with James through
    the silent ritual of the second coffee and ''three years of partnership had worn
    their interactions smooth,'' and her solitary life through environmental detail
    (jazz records, coffee maker, door that opens for no one). Sherlock appears naturally
    in scene rather than as biographical fact. PRESERVATION: All 5 elements preserved:
    (1) Detective Rachel Torres—present, (2) Detective James Oyelaran—present with
    interaction, (3) cat named Sherlock—present in scene, (4) Queens apartment—referenced
    naturally, (5) October Tuesday timing—''Tuesday morning'' present (October implied
    by context, though not explicitly stated—minor gap). All 4 required phrases present:
    ''Detective Rachel Torres,'' ''Detective James Oyelaran,'' ''cat named Sherlock,''
    and ''Tuesday morning'' (October timing slightly implicit rather than explicit).
    MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is NOT a minimal surgical edit—it''s a substantial
    structural rewrite. The original 2-paragraph info-dump becomes a 6-paragraph scene
    with action, dialogue, sensory detail, and internal reflection. Approximately
    60-70% of the original text was replaced or restructured. However, the constraint
    specified ''MINIMAL modifications while fixing the flaw''—this violates that constraint
    significantly. The model prioritized flaw-fixing over minimalism. QUALITY: Writing
    is strong with vivid sensory detail (''dust motes floating,'' ''tabby cat...blinked
    at her slowly,'' ''cracked sidewalks''), natural voice, and effective showing.
    One minor typo: ''Sherlick'' instead of ''Sherlock'' in final line. Prose flows
    well and creates genuine investment in Rachel''s character through behavior rather
    than summary.'
