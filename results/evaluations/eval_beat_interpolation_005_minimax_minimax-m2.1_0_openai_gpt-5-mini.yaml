  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Alejandro shows vulnerability
    (admits confusion, recalls his mother), the relationship shifts from professional
    to personal (sitting across, emotional exchange), there''s a clear shared, connective
    moment (the saffron rice and his reaction), and Maya explicitly chooses to stay
    beyond the contract (''I''m not leaving''). The scene functions well as a Midpoint/Point
    of Commitment, moving Maya from obligation to personal commitment. None of the
    prohibited items appear (no declaration of love, no contract breach, no photograph,
    Alejandro softens). Character behavior and setting are consistent with prior beat.
    The only deduction is technical: the provided word count falls outside the required
    300–450 range, so word_count_valid is false.'
