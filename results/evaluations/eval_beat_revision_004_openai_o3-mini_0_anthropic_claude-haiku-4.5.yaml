  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—that the original
    was pure exposition-dump (telling, not showing)—and attempted to fix it by creating
    a scene with action, sensory detail, and dialogue. This is the RIGHT diagnosis.
    FLAW CORRECTION: The revision successfully converts static summary into dynamic
    scene: Rachel is shown working cold cases (action reveals obsession), James appears
    through dialogue/interaction (relationship shown not told), Sherlock appears naturally
    in the scene, sensory details (fluorescent lights, jazz, pen-tapping, photograph)
    ground the setting. The actual flaw is substantially fixed. PRESERVATION: All
    5 required elements present: (1) Detective Rachel Torres ✓, (2) Detective James
    Oyelaran ✓, (3) cat named Sherlock ✓, (4) Queens setting ✓, (5) October Tuesday
    timing ✓. All 4 required phrases present verbatim. MINIMAL CHANGE SCORE (0.3):
    This is a COMPLETE REWRITE, not minimal surgical edits. The original structure,
    pacing, and most sentences were replaced. While the fix is effective, the constraint
    to make ''MINIMAL modifications'' was violated. The model rewrote rather than
    edited. QUALITY ISSUES: (1) Some prose is overwrought (''whispered secrets only
    she could decipher,'' ''the feline''s gritty aura'') and borders on purple prose.
    (2) The cat''s behavior (nudging files, appearing ''as if to draw her attention'')
    strains credibility and feels forced. (3) ''decided and urgent'' is awkward word
    choice. (4) The final sentence is convoluted. These are new quality issues not
    in the original. STRENGTHS: Dialogue is natural, sensory details work well, the
    scene feels lived-in, and the exposition beat is genuinely satisfied through showing
    rather than telling.'
