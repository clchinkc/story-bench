  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw\u2014that the\
    \ original was pure exposition-dump (telling, not showing)\u2014and attempted\
    \ to fix it by creating a scene with action, sensory detail, and dialogue. This\
    \ is the RIGHT diagnosis. FLAW CORRECTION: The revision successfully converts\
    \ static summary into dynamic scene: Rachel is shown working cold cases (action\
    \ reveals obsession), James appears through dialogue/interaction (relationship\
    \ shown not told), Sherlock appears naturally in the scene, sensory details (fluorescent\
    \ lights, jazz, pen-tapping, photograph) ground the setting. The actual flaw is\
    \ substantially fixed. PRESERVATION: All 5 required elements present: (1) Detective\
    \ Rachel Torres \u2713, (2) Detective James Oyelaran \u2713, (3) cat named Sherlock\
    \ \u2713, (4) Queens setting \u2713, (5) October Tuesday timing \u2713. All 4\
    \ required phrases present verbatim. MINIMAL CHANGE SCORE (0.3): This is a COMPLETE\
    \ REWRITE, not minimal surgical edits. The original structure, pacing, and most\
    \ sentences were replaced. While the fix is effective, the constraint to make\
    \ 'MINIMAL modifications' was violated. The model rewrote rather than edited.\
    \ QUALITY ISSUES: (1) Some prose is overwrought ('whispered secrets only she could\
    \ decipher,' 'the feline's gritty aura') and borders on purple prose. (2) The\
    \ cat's behavior (nudging files, appearing 'as if to draw her attention') strains\
    \ credibility and feels forced. (3) 'decided and urgent' is awkward word choice.\
    \ (4) The final sentence is convoluted. These are new quality issues not in the\
    \ original. STRENGTHS: Dialogue is natural, sensory details work well, the scene\
    \ feels lived-in, and the exposition beat is genuinely satisfied through showing\
    \ rather than telling."
