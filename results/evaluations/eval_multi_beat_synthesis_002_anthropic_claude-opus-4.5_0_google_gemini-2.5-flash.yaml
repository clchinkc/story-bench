    as a ''gap between duty and distraction'' rather than an immediate danger Amara
    has to overcome with wit. She slips through, implying ease rather than a challenge.)'

    she acknowledges the danger, the story doesn''t explicitly show her recognizing
    the personal cost or transformation reaching the stronghold will bring, beyond
    the immediate threat.)'
