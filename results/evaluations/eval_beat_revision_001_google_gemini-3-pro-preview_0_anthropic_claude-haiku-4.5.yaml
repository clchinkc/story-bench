  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated
    The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis. It diagnosed
    all four actual flaws: (1) lack of internal fear confrontation, (2) absence of
    a death moment, (3) no transformation, (4) victory through persistence rather
    than insight. FLAW CORRECTION: All four required elements were successfully integrated:
    (1) Dragon exploits guilt over brother''s death, making the threat psychological
    not just physical; (2) Clear death moment (''Let go... Join him'') where Kira
    surrenders and symbolically dies; (3) Rebirth/transformation occurs (''The guilt
    shattered... burning with a new, violet light''); (4) Victory comes from acceptance
    and understanding (''she stepped into the darkness... piercing the heart of her
    own despair''), not mere persistence. BEAT SATISFACTION: Executes Campbell''s
    Ordeal beat excellently—confrontation with deepest fear (survivor''s guilt), symbolic
    death (surrender to darkness), rebirth (violet light, new identity), and emergence
    transformed. The internal journey parallels and supersedes the external combat.
    PRESERVATION: All 4 required phrases present: ''Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across
    the chasm'' (exact), ''The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales
    and burning eyes'' (exact), ''"You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled''
    (exact), ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar'' (exact). All
    4 preserved elements intact: Shadow Dragon, Kira with sword, brother''s death
    reference, victorious outcome. MINIMAL CHANGES: While the revision is substantial
    (377 words vs ~200 original), the changes are surgical rather than wholesale.
    Core structure preserved: opening confrontation, dragon dialogue, three knockdowns/rises,
    final sword strike, victory. Additions are layered in (guilt manifestation, smoke-face,
    void moment, violet light) rather than replacing existing beats. The skeleton
    remains recognizable. QUALITY: Writing quality elevated significantly—prose is
    more evocative, metaphors are precise (guilt as smoke, darkness as internal),
    dialogue serves thematic purpose. No new errors introduced. Pacing improved. Minor
    note: ''earth-shaking'' should be ''earth-shattering'' for idiom, but this is
    negligible.'
error: null
