  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw by demonstrating Sophie''s changed
    relationship to work: she pockets her phone, places it face-down on the dash,
    and explicitly names an insight from the retreat (''how loud my head used to be''
    / ''Now I can hear myself think''), then chooses to defer emergencies. This correctly
    targets the missing Return/Change beat. Changes were moderate and surgical—original
    structure, characters, and beats remain, with added internal reflection and a
    physical habit as markers of change. The only minor omission is a clearly explicit
    line where the mother explicitly comments on Sophie being different; the mother
    only gestures, so that one required nuance is implied rather than stated outright.'
