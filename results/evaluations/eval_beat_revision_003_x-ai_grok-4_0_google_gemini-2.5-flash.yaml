  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie not showing
    evidence of change upon her return. It introduced a clear moment where Sophie
    applies a lesson from her retreat to her work stress, contrasting her old behavior
    with her new one. Her mother's reaction ('That's new.') explicitly highlights
    the change. The changes were surgical, adding a few sentences and modifying one
    line to demonstrate the transformation, while preserving the vast majority of
    the original text and all required elements.
