  evidence: 'All four three-act beats are present: Act 1 (ordinary world, inciting
    letter, first plot point = travel to Kyoto), Act 2A (arrival, Haruki, building
    relations, midpoint = rivals'' offer), Act 2B (complication: Yuki’s rejection,
    second plot point = his refusal of the deal and decision to go to the temple),
    Act 3 (climax at the wedding/temple, denouement with the bamboo shop). All eight
    core elements are preserved. Minor structural deductions (–0.10): the midpoint/second-act
    break could be more sharply signposted (the rivals’ offer functions as midpoint
    but the beats blur slightly), and the transition from refusing the deal to the
    temple scene is a touch abrupt. Small tone deduction (–0.05): the piece strongly
    evokes quiet Japanese aesthetics and redemptive mood, but occasional corporate
    phrasing slightly lessens the aesthetic consistency. Word count invalid because
    provided text length (530 words) falls below the required 550–750 range.'
