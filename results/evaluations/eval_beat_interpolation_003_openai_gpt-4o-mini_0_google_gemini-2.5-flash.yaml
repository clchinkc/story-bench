  evidence: The 'Search' beat is well-executed. Yuki explores crew quarters and the
    medical bay, finds clues about 'Intra-dimensional resonance' and experiments,
    encounters a transformed crew member, and faces an obstacle with the containment
    unit. All required elements are present, and no 'must not' items are violated.
    The character's behavior is consistent. The bridge to the 'After' beat is good,
    though the 'After' beat immediately jumps to the data core in Lab Seven without
    a direct lead-in from the 'Search' beat's ending, which focused on a containment
    unit in the medical bay. This is a minor discontinuity in the immediate transition,
    but the overall narrative flow is maintained.
