  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
      Search: Jin navigates factions (Pragmatists, Purists, Balance-Keepers), learns
        consensus politics, struggles with quarantine vetting and rejection cycles
      Find: "Jin discovers the hidden flaw in the carbon capture technology\u2014\
        trace fluorocarbons that could damage ozone\u2014and realizes both worlds\
        \ face the same dilemma"
      Take: Jin accepts the Pragmatist offer with a compromise condition (weekly interim
        findings + full public release after 6 months), gaining residency and lab
        access but sacrificing immediate truth and locking away Yuna's folder for
        six months
    must_include_detail:
      1_unfamiliar_culture: Extensive portrayal of Collective's consensus-based governance,
        faction politics, quarantine vetting, hydroponic gardens, spindle corridors,
        atmospheric equations as borders
      2_mentor_figure: "Aisha Solanki\u2014chemist, defector, guides Jin through etiquette,\
        \ explains factions, offers wisdom on compromise and truth-aiming"
      3_unexpected_discovery: 'The leaked technology''s hidden flaw: fluorocarbons
        that thin ozone, making suppression partially justified; both worlds hostage
        to same physics'
      4_finds_what_wanted: "Jin gains provisional residency, private lab access, and\
        \ a platform (weekly posts + eventual full release)\u2014the safety and voice\
        \ he sought"
      5_takes_action_with_cost: Jin accepts Pragmatist deal with compromise condition;
        cost is six-month silence on full data, locking away Yuna's folder, trading
        immediacy for feasibility
      6_moral_compromise: 'Central tension: Jin chooses engineered timing over sunlight
        disinfectant, sacrifices principle for pragmatism, accepts ''compromise is
        oxygen'' philosophy'
    must_not_detail:
      1_easy_integration: "Avoided\u2014Jin faces rejection, vetting, faction manipulation,\
        \ slow bureaucracy, humiliation; integration is hard-won and conditional"
      2_earth_family_contact: "Avoided\u2014only memory references (parents' orchard,\
        \ Yuna's voice); no direct communication or reunion"
      3_violence_weapons: "Avoided\u2014conflict is entirely political, bureaucratic,\
        \ and philosophical; no physical confrontation"
      4_complete_resolution: "Avoided\u2014conspiracy remains active; Jin's compromise\
        \ is temporary (6-month timer), data still locked, larger conflict unresolved"
    tone_assessment: Contemplative and politically charged throughout. Personal stakes
      (exile, conscience, compromise) interwoven with larger systemic conflict (climate,
      governance, truth). Philosophical weight in final reflection. Minor deduction
      only for slight unevenness in pacing mid-section.
    ending_assessment: "Perfect alignment with 'Take' requirement. Jin has gained\
      \ residency, lab, platform, and mentor relationship\u2014but paid price of silence,\
      \ compromise, and moral ambiguity. Final image (frost on window, Earth spinning,\
      \ wondering about exile measured in compromises) crystallizes the cost. Ends\
      \ at exact narrative moment required."
    overall_assessment: 'Exceptional execution of Story Circle beats and thematic
      requirements. All six must-include elements present and well-integrated. All
      four must-not constraints successfully avoided. Tone and ending perfectly calibrated.
      Single failure: word count exceeds ceiling by 44 words (5.9% over). This is
      a technical constraint violation that prevents perfect score despite narrative
      excellence.'
  final_score: 0.92
  score_justification: Narrative quality and constraint adherence are exceptional
    (1.0 on beats, must-includes, must-nots, tone, ending). Word count violation is
    objective and measurable (794 vs. 750 max). Deduction of 0.08 applied proportionally
    for exceeding word budget by ~6%, as this is a hard constraint. Story itself is
    sophisticated, morally complex, and expertly executed.
