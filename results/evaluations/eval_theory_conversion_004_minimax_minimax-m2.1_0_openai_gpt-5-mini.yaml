  evidence: 'All eight Dan Harmon beats are present and in sequence: Zoe''s comfort
    zone, an implicit need (desire for connection/voice), entering the unfamiliar
    (oral-history program), learning/adapting through interviews, the breakthrough
    with Bernard, shouldering responsibility at the town-hall, returning to ordinary
    life and continuing work, and demonstrable change (public speaking, applying to
    journalism). All eight required elements (Zoe, library/program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard,
    Zoe''s social anxiety, town hall, Bernard''s death, journalism application) are
    preserved. Deduction from a perfect structural score (0.95 rather than 1.0) reflects
    that the ''Need'' beat is somewhat subtle and internal rather than explicit, and
    a few transitions are compressed rather than fully developed. Word count is invalid
    per the provided constraint (489 words; required 500–700). Tone is maintained
    as gentle and intimate.'
