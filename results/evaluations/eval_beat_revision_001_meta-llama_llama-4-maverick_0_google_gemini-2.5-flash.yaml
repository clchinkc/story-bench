  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the core flaw of the Ordeal
    being a mere boss battle. It introduced the dragon exploiting Kira's guilt over
    her brother's death, creating a confrontation with her deepest fear. The 'death'
    moment is present when she falls to her knees and her 'world go dark,' followed
    by a rebirth/transformation as she recalls her brother's determination and gains
    'newfound ferocity.' Victory comes from this internal shift, not just persistence.
    The changes were surgical, focusing on dialogue and Kira's internal state, preserving
    much of the original structure and required phrases. The only minor point is that
    the 'new understanding' could be slightly more explicit, but it's strongly implied
    by her renewed determination and the lifting of guilt.
