  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are clearly present and in order: Exposition (Samira,
    lab, status quo), Rising Action (quarantine, evolving pathogen, investigation),
    Climax (revelation of Nexus and legal confrontation), Falling Action (press conference/upload
    and immediate fallout), Denouement (cure deployed, Samira disgraced and leaving).
    All six required elements are preserved: Samira, engineered virus, Raj, Nexus,
    public release of the cure, and Samira''s career sacrifice. Tone consistently
    maintains medical-thriller tension with ethical stakes. No deductions applied.'
