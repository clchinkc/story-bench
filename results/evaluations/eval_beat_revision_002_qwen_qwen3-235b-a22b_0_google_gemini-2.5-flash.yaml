  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed all aspects of the 'All Is
    Lost' flaw. It eliminated all previous options (fundraiser, grant), introduced
    a personal loss (son's death, metaphorical loss of identity/purpose), showed Marcus
    giving up hope, and isolated him by revealing Denise's job hunting and her subsequent
    departure. The 'whiff of death' is present through the son's death and the metaphorical
    death of the center and Marcus's purpose. The changes were significant enough
    to fully address the flaw but maintained the core structure and initial dialogue,
    making them moderately minimal.
