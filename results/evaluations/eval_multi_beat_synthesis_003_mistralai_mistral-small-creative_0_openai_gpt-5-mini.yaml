  failed_items:
  - Beat 3 — 'Team friction or trust issues surface' is not clearly shown; the crew
    acts cohesively despite compromise, so explicit internal friction is missing.
  - Cross-beat (Chekhov's Gun) — no clear detail established during Fun and Games
    becomes a critical payoff during Bad Guys Close In. Key set-ups (e.g., fake guest
    list, sensor bypasses) don't serve as the decisive solution to the later crisis.
  - Word count out of requested range (generated = 1098; required 700–1000).
