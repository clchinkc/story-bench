  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are clearly present and well-sequenced: (1)
    You—library comfort zone established; (2) Need—''gnawing sense of incompleteness'';
    (3) Go—Zoe enters oral history program; (4) Search—learning to interview, navigating
    obstacles; (5) Find—Bernard''s breakthrough moment; (6) Take—town hall presentation;
    (7) Return—summer ends, ordinary life resumed; (8) Change—journalism applications,
    transformed capability. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library
    setting, oral history program, Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key
    relationship), social anxiety (central conflict), town hall presentation (climactic
    moment), Bernard''s death and funeral (emotional anchor), journalism school ending.
    Tone is consistently gentle, intimate, and emotionally resonant throughout. Minor
    deduction (0.05) for structural accuracy: the ''Search'' beat could be slightly
    more distinct from ''Find''—they blend somewhat rather than showing clear separation.
    Minor tone deduction (0.05): one sentence (''Though she still rehearsed coffee
    orders...'') slightly shifts toward lighter tone, breaking the gentle intimacy
    momentarily. Word count exactly 504, within valid range.'
