  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1: Introduction of an unexpected complication (minor) - The mentor''s presence
    is a major complication, not minor, and it''s introduced too early for ''Fun and
    Games''.'
  - 'Beat 2: False victory: a key objective achieved - The painting is acquired, but
    the ''false victory'' aspect isn''t strongly emphasized as a beat. It feels more
    like the end of the ''Fun and Games'' phase.'
  - 'Beat 2: The nature of the heist changes (from simple theft to something more)
    - While Eleanor''s involvement changes things, the *nature* of the heist (getting
    the painting out) hasn''t fundamentally shifted yet, only the difficulty.'
  - 'Beat 3: Team friction or trust issues surface - Not present.'
  - 'Beat 3: A crew member compromised or in danger - Not explicitly shown, though
    the general danger increases.'
  - 'Beat 3: Miri must choose: painting or revenge/saving someone - Not present.'
  - 'Cross-beat constraint: Chekhov''s Gun - While the autopilot is mentioned, its
    setup and payoff aren''t clearly traced as a critical element from Fun and Games
    to Bad Guys Close In. It''s more of a general environmental factor.'
  - The story repeats the last two paragraphs multiple times, which significantly
    impacts coherence and word count validity.
