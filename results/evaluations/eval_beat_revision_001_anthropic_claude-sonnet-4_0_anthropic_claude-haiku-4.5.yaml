  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the actual flaw\u2014that the\
    \ original segment treated The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative\
    \ crisis. The revision demonstrates precise understanding by addressing all four\
    \ missing components: (1) Dragon exploits Kira's deepest fear (guilt over brother's\
    \ death, not just physical threat), (2) Clear 'death' moment (lying broken on\
    \ ground, accepting failure), (3) Transformation occurs (shift from desperate\
    \ fury to quiet acceptance), (4) Victory comes from new understanding (acting\
    \ from acceptance rather than proving something). PRESERVATION: All 4 required\
    \ phrases present verbatim: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm,' 'The\
    \ creature was massive\u2014twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,'\
    \ 'You cannot defeat me, child,' the dragon rumbled,' and 'The Shadow Dragon collapsed\
    \ with a earth-shaking roar.' All 4 preserved elements intact (Shadow Dragon,\
    \ Kira with sword, brother's death reference, victory). MINIMAL CHANGES: The revision\
    \ is surgical rather than a complete rewrite. Core structure preserved: opening\
    \ setup, dragon dialogue, three knockdowns, final strike, victory. Additions are\
    \ targeted: psychological exploitation of guilt, internal monologue during 'death'\
    \ moment, rebirth paragraph, closing wisdom. Approximately 60% of original phrasing\
    \ retained, 40% added/modified\u2014this represents disciplined constraint rather\
    \ than wholesale reconstruction. QUALITY: Writing maintains professional tone,\
    \ no new errors introduced, prose flows naturally, dialogue feels organic to character\
    \ and moment. Minor note: 'earth-shaking' should be 'earth-shaking' (hyphenation\
    \ correct as written). The transformation feels earned and psychologically coherent."
