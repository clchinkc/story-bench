  evidence: 'All eight Dan Harmon beats are clearly present and follow the intended
    sequence: Zoe''s comfort zone, her unnamed lack, entering the oral-history program,
    learning/adapting through interviews, the breakthrough with Bernard, the town-hall
    confrontation (taking the cost/responsibility), returning to ordinary life while
    continuing the work, and demonstrable change (journal applications, speaking at
    the funeral). All eight required elements (Zoe, library/program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard
    Park, Zoe''s social anxiety, town hall presentation, Bernard''s death, journalism
    application/ending) are preserved. Tone remains gentle and intimate. No deductions
    applied.'
