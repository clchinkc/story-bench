  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World—Maya''s comfortable pottery
    life; (2) Call to Adventure—sacred spring dries, elders seek master vessel; (3)
    Refusal—Maya shakes head, doubts herself; (4) Meeting the Mentor—grandmother''s
    letter and journal serve as mentor presence; (5) Crossing Threshold—three-day
    journey begins; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—storm, blisters, self-doubt as obstacles;
    (7) Approach to Inmost Cave—shrine discovery and journal reading; (8) Ordeal—night
    of failed attempts, surrender breakthrough; (9) Reward—vessel created, identity
    transformed; (10) Road Back—difficult descent with doubt; (11) Resurrection—moment
    at spring where Maya accepts her transformation. MISSING: (12) Return with Elixir
    is present but underdeveloped—the water flowing and village transformation are
    mentioned but feel rushed rather than fully realized as the elixir''s impact.
    PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact—Maya (protagonist), pottery (central skill),
    grandmother''s legacy (journal, letter, techniques), mountain shrine (three-day
    journey), dried spring (problem/catalyst), surrender theme (explicit throughout),
    transformation (clear arc). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Follows monomyth sequence logically
    with strong cause-effect. Minor weakness: Resurrection beat could be more distinct
    from Road Back. TONE: Consistently quiet, meditative, introspective. Excellent
    use of internal monologue, sensory detail (blisters, firelight, clay), and contemplative
    pacing. Language choices (''permission,'' ''listener,'' ''honest'') reinforce
    transformative theme throughout.'
