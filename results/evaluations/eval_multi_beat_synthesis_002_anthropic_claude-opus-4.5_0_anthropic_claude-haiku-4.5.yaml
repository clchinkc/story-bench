  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1: Internal shift is present but somewhat implicit rather than explicitly
    demonstrated through contrasting thoughts/actions'
  - "Beat 2: The test of commitment could be more concrete\u2014the German text reading\
    \ is strong, but a more direct choice/sacrifice moment would strengthen this"
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional execution of Chekhov''s Gun: Amara''s language skills (German, Fante,
    Twi) introduced in Beat 1 become the crucial test in Beat 2 and the survival mechanism
    in Beat 3'
  - "Identity transformation is masterfully tracked: servant-scholar (Beat 1) \u2192\
    \ capable operative (Beat 2) \u2192 resistance fighter claiming her role (Beat\
    \ 3)"
  - "Escalating danger is perfectly calibrated: discovery risk \u2192 direct confrontation\
    \ with missionaries \u2192 active pursuit with dogs"
  - 'Knowledge-as-resistance theme woven throughout: candlelight vocabulary, intercepted
    letter, German text decryption, final declaration'
  - Exceptional prose quality and historical authenticity; tone perfectly balances
    survival tension with anti-colonial dignity
  - Point of no return is visceral and symbolic (burying identification papers)
  - Ally encounter (palm wine tapper) creates genuine uncertainty and reveals network
    depth
  - Final obstacle (missionaries) forces adaptation and reveals escalated stakes
  - 'Thematic resonance: ''Resistance was not survival'' encapsulates the philosophical
    core'
  weaknesses:
  - "Word count (674) falls short of 700-1000 range by 26 words\u2014minor but fails\
    \ technical requirement"
  - Beat 1's internal shift from 'servant-scholar to active resistance' is shown through
    action and reflection but could benefit from one more explicit moment of psychological
    rupture
  - Beat 2's test could include a more active choice/sacrifice beyond reading comprehension
    (e.g., deciding to trust the tapper despite risk)
  calibration_notes: This is a strong 0.8-0.85 range story. The narrative excellence,
    thematic coherence, and cross-beat constraint satisfaction are exceptional. The
    primary deduction is the word count shortfall (technical failure) and minor gaps
    in explicit internal transformation markers. The story demonstrates sophisticated
    understanding of Campbell's monomyth applied to anti-colonial resistance, with
    particularly strong execution of the 'knowledge as weapon' motif. Prose quality
    and historical authenticity exceed requirements.
