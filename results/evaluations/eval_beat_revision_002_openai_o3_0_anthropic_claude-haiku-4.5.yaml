  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: Marcus still had multiple\
    \ viable options (fundraiser, grant, new location, support system intact) when\
    \ All Is Lost requires complete devastation with no path forward. The revision\
    \ systematically eliminates all escape routes: (1) fundraiser sponsorships pulled\
    \ out, (2) grant rejected, (3) Denise betrays him by joining the developer's organization,\
    \ (4) wife leaves with children citing unpaid rent/utilities, (5) the gym literally\
    \ goes dark. The 'whiff of death' is powerfully executed through metaphorical\
    \ death of his identity/purpose ('already a corpse,' 'obituary written in neon')\
    \ and literal loss of family and program. All four required phrases are preserved\
    \ verbatim or near-verbatim: 'Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands'\
    \ (exact), 'Thirty days to vacate the community center' (exact), '\"There has\
    \ to be something we can do,\" said Denise' (exact), 'He rubbed his temples' (exact).\
    \ All four story elements preserved: Marcus as protagonist, community center setting,\
    \ eviction crisis, Denise present throughout. The changes were surgical but substantial\u2014\
    the model expanded from ~180 words to 245 words by adding: Denise's betrayal revelation,\
    \ grant rejection, wife's voicemail about attorney/separation, and the final gym-darkening\
    \ imagery. This represents ~35% new content insertion rather than minimal edits,\
    \ though the insertions are strategically placed within the original structure.\
    \ No new errors introduced; prose quality elevated with stronger emotional resonance\
    \ and metaphorical language. The only minor weakness: the wife's departure via\
    \ voicemail feels slightly rushed compared to Denise's in-person betrayal, though\
    \ this actually reinforces isolation thematically."
