  evidence: "All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly marked: (1) You\u2014\
    opening library comfort zone with precise sensory detail; (2) Need\u2014'What\
    \ was missing, she didn't name' establishes the gap; (3) Go\u2014'She left the\
    \ quiet anyway' marks threshold crossing; (4) Search\u2014'She learned by trying'\
    \ section shows adaptation through five interviews; (5) Find\u2014Bernard's breakthrough\
    \ moment ('You're the first person who ever asked the right questions'); (6) Take\u2014\
    town hall presentation where she gives voice publicly; (7) Return\u2014summer\
    \ ends, she returns to library but changed; (8) Change\u2014demonstrated through\
    \ action (visiting Bernard, funeral speech, journalism applications, steady hands).\
    \ All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history\
    \ program, Ms. Okafor (initiating mentor), Bernard Park (key relationship), social\
    \ anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic Take beat), Bernard's\
    \ death and funeral (Return/Change catalyst), journalism school ending. Minor\
    \ deduction from structural_accuracy (0.05) for slight compression of the Search\
    \ phase\u2014only five interviews mentioned rather than more granular progression.\
    \ Tone is consistently gentle and intimate with emotionally resonant language\
    \ ('small, unfamiliar animal,' 'warm wind,' 'bright eye'). Prose maintains Campbell-to-Harmon\
    \ conversion elegantly without losing narrative intimacy."
