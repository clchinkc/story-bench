  evidence: 'All four target beats are present (Act I setup with inciting incident,
    Act II first-half growth/midpoint, Act II second-half complication/second plot
    point, Act III resolution). All eight required elements are preserved (Kenji,
    lost career, Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki, business temptation, people-over-ambition
    theme, bamboo shop ending). Deductions: structural score slightly below perfect
    because the midpoint functions more as emotional softening than a sharp reversal
    and the first plot point is somewhat implicit rather than sharply demarcated;
    transitions between II-A and II-B are compacted. Tone is very well maintained
    (quiet drama, Japanese aesthetic, redemptive) but drops slightly for a few overtly
    modern/corporate lines that feel on-the-nose. Word-count flagged invalid per the
    provided criteria: the metadata indicates 537 words, which is below the required
    550–750 range.'
