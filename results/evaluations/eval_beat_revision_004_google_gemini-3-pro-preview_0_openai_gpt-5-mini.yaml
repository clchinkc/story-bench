  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw (exposition was telling rather than
    showing) by converting summary into a lived scene: sensory detail (radiator hiss,
    station smell), action that reveals character (holstering weapon, scratching Sherlock,
    pulling the dusty Miller file), and dialogue that shows the partnership (James
    delivering coffee and banter). The dusty cold-case file left within reach demonstrates
    Rachel''s devotion to cold cases. Required elements (Detective Rachel Torres;
    Detective James Oyelaran; cat Sherlock; Tuesday morning in October; Queens apartment)
    are all preserved. Changes were not minimal/surgical—the piece was substantially
    rewritten from an info-dump into a scene—hence a low minimal_change_score. A small
    leftover bit of telling remains (e.g., ''This was the rhythm: ... predictable
    and controlled''), but overall the exposition beat is effectively executed.'
