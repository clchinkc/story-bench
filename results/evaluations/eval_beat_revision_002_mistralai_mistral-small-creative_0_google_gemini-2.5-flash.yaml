  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true ''All Is Lost'' moment. It addressed the flaw by: 1) having the fundraiser
    already fail and the grant rejected, 2) introducing a personal loss (father''s
    health crisis) to isolate Marcus and provide a ''whiff of death,'' and 3) showing
    Marcus genuinely giving up hope. The changes were not minimal, as significant
    new text was added and some original lines were altered or removed to achieve
    the desired effect. For instance, ''He rubbed his temples'' was removed, and the
    line about Denise''s initial suggestion was changed.'
