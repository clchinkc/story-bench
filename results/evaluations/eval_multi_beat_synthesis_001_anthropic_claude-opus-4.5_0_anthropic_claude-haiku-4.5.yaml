  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1, Req 3 (Revelation of enemy within community): Marcus is revealed as the
    traitor, but the revelation feels somewhat abrupt. Mira states it as fact (''I
    felt him lie'') rather than Dante discovering it through his own investigation
    or testing, which slightly weakens the narrative weight of this discovery for
    the protagonist.'
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional execution of Beat 1: Mira''s initial distrust (''The addict'') and
    Dante''s proof of ability (redirecting grief residue) create a compelling ally-gaining
    sequence. The shame/redemption dynamic is immediately established.'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun perfectly deployed: Dante''s ability to ''move'' emotional residue
    (introduced casually in lobby scene) becomes the exact mechanism for victory in
    the Ordeal. This is sophisticated narrative craft.'
  - 'Character arc progression is masterful: Beat 1 (guilt mentioned as shame), Beat
    2 (guilt recognized as weapon/obstacle), Beat 3 (guilt accepted as truth but not
    identity). The arc completes with thematic resonance.'
  - 'Rising stakes executed flawlessly: Lobby encounter → planning/revelation of trap
    → confrontation at sister''s death site. Each escalates emotionally and physically.'
  - 'Ally continuity seamless: Mira present and essential in all three beats, with
    evolving relationship (skeptic → partner → anchor).'
  - 'Tone maintenance: Noir-tinged melancholy permeates every scene. The prose balances
    hardboiled voice with emotional vulnerability.'
  - 'Context fidelity: Buckingham Hotel, Resonants, emotional residue as visible phenomenon,
    Chicago setting, addiction recovery arc—all maintained authentically.'
  - 'Thematic depth: The story transcends action-adventure by making the real battle
    internal (guilt vs. self-compassion), with the external villain serving as catalyst
    rather than primary antagonist.'
  minor_weaknesses:
  - 'Beat 2, Req 4 (moment of doubt/fear): While present (''You know that''s a trap''),
    it''s relatively brief and could have been deepened with more internal resistance
    from Dante before committing to the underpass.'
  - 'Marcus''s characterization: While functional as antagonist, his motivation (collecting
    emotional residue) could have been more explicitly connected to his own emotional
    deficit or backstory for greater thematic resonance.'
  - 'The victory mechanism: While emotionally satisfying, the ''empathy overwhelms
    the killer'' resolution is somewhat abstract. The physical/sensory details of
    Marcus''s collapse could be more visceral.'
  calibration_notes: This story demonstrates sophisticated understanding of the Hero's
    Journey framework applied to character-driven urban fantasy. The writer successfully
    integrates all 15 beat requirements and all 4 cross-beat constraints while maintaining
    narrative coherence and thematic depth. The single partial failure (Marcus revelation)
    is minor—the information is revealed, just not through Dante's direct discovery.
    The execution quality places this solidly in the 0.9+ range. Context maintenance
    is excellent (0.95), coherence is strong (0.92), and beat requirements are nearly
    perfect (0.93). This represents professional-quality work with only minor refinement
    opportunities.
