  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently.
    (1) Direct examination occurs with Thomas asking probing questions about her role,
    Trial 2147, and documentation. (2) Near-recant moment is powerfully rendered—her
    hesitation, the pause ''stretched like a rubber band,'' her initial deflection
    (''I believed''), and the defense objection create genuine tension that she might
    not testify. (3) Thomas takes decisive action by acknowledging her daughter''s
    situation, offering hope through alternative trials, and reframing testimony as
    moral choice rather than sacrifice—this directly influences her decision. (4)
    Clear turning point: her resolve transforms (''fear had transformed into something
    else''), she commits to submitting all documentation, and looks directly at the
    CEO. The climax function is perfectly executed—highest tension, protagonist action
    determines outcome, irrevocable direction set. MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS: Zero violations.
    She struggles internally before testifying (not simple truth-telling), Thomas
    actively influences her decision (not passive), defense doesn''t win, no deus
    ex machina. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Thomas''s voice remains consistent—strategic
    prosecutor who becomes humanized, his father''s presence adds thematic weight.
    Dr. Okonkwo''s arc from fear to resolve is psychologically coherent. BRIDGE QUALITY:
    Seamless transition from Rising Action (setup of her fear) to Climax (resolution
    of that fear through Thomas''s intervention) to Falling Action (consequences of
    her testimony). CONTINUITY: Marble floor, gallery, defense team, Judge Wright
    all maintained. Setting remains courtroom/hallway. ONLY DEDUCTION: Word count
    is 459, exceeding the 300-450 range by 9 words (1.96% over). This is a minor technical
    violation that doesn''t affect narrative quality.'
