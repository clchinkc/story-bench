  evidence: 'All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-sequenced: (1) Exposition
    establishes Samira''s 15-year reputation and lab environment before the anomalous
    protein discovery; (2) Rising Action spans the 72-hour containment chaos with
    escalating complications and Raj''s support; (3) Climax peaks with dual revelations—Nexus
    Biotech connection AND the lawyer summons creating maximum tension; (4) Falling
    Action executes the press conference strategy and immediate consequences; (5)
    Denouement provides new equilibrium with Samira''s career sacrifice and philosophical
    acceptance. All 6 core elements preserved: protagonist (Samira), engineered virus,
    Raj, Nexus antagonist, public cure release, career sacrifice. Structural accuracy
    is near-perfect—the conversion successfully transforms 3-act linearity into 5-act
    pyramid architecture with clear escalation to climax and resolution. Tone maintains
    medical thriller tension throughout with ethical weight evident in Samira''s internal
    conflict and final sacrifice. Minor deduction (0.05) for structural accuracy:
    the climax could be slightly more singular/focused rather than dual-revelation,
    though this actually strengthens narrative tension. Minor tone deduction (0.1):
    final denouement leans slightly philosophical/reflective rather than maintaining
    maximum thriller tension, though this is appropriate for resolution phase.'
