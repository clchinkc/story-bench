  evidence: 'All 12 Campbellian beats are present and ordered (Ordinary World through
    Return with Elixir). All 7 required elements are preserved: Maya protagonist,
    pottery centrality, grandmother Elara and her journal legacy, journey to mountain
    shrine, dried spring as the central problem, the explicit theme of surrendering
    control, and Maya’s transformation. The only deduction is that the provided word_count
    (833) falls outside the requested 600–800 range, so word_count_valid is false;
    no other deductions were necessary.'
