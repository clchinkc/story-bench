  evidence: 'The model identified the telling-vs-showing flaw and revised the passage
    into a scene: Rachel makes coffee, interacts with her cat Sherlock, walks into
    the busy precinct and exchanges dialogue with James, which demonstrates instincts,
    devotion to cold cases, and their partnership through action and sensory detail.
    This addresses the actual flaw correctly (diagnosis_score=1.0) and largely fixes
    it (flaw_correction_score=0.8), though a few sentences still ''tell'' (e.g., ''She
    felt the weight of the unsolved cases...'') rather than fully showing. All five
    required story elements (Rachel, James, Sherlock, Queens apartment, Tuesday in
    October) are preserved (preservation_score=1.0). Of the four exact required phrases,
    only ''Detective Rachel Torres'' and ''Tuesday morning in October'' appear verbatim;
    ''Detective James Oyelaran'' and ''cat named Sherlock'' are not exact matches
    (required_preserved_score=0.5). The revision is a moderate rewrite rather than
    a minimal surgical edit (minimal_change_score=0.5) and is of high writing quality
    with no significant new errors (quality_score=0.9).'
