  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present (11/12): 1) Ordinary World (coastal village,
    simple pottery), 2) Call to Adventure (elders'' request for ceremonial vessel),
    3) Refusal of Call (explicit: ''I''m a teacher of simple wares. Ask another''),
    4) Meeting the Mentor (old tile potter with shard wisdom), 5) Crossing the Threshold
    (dawn departure on cliff road), 6) Tests/Allies/Enemies (shepherd boy ally, wind/rain/loose
    stones as obstacles), 7) Approach to Inmost Cave (shrine discovery, kiln reconstruction),
    8) Ordeal (the creation process itself—surrender, loss of control), 9) Reward/Seizing
    the Sword (completed vessel, understanding of surrender), 10) Road Back (treacherous
    descent, temptation to abandon vessel), 11) Resurrection (water rises, transformation
    complete). MISSING: 12) Return with Elixir is weakly rendered—the teaching moment
    exists but lacks the full ''gift to community'' resonance Campbell emphasizes.
    PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact—Maya (protagonist), pottery/ceramics (central),
    grandmother''s legacy (journal, shard, sketchbook), mountain shrine (three-day
    journey), dried spring (catalyst and resolution), surrender theme (pervasive),
    transformation (explicit internal shift). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Strong alignment
    with monomyth structure; clear progression through stages. Minor weakness: Resurrection
    beat conflates with Return—water rising IS the resurrection/proof, but lacks a
    separate ''test of new knowledge'' moment. TONE: Exceptional meditative quality
    maintained throughout—lyrical language (''salt-damp breezes,'' ''kiln she could
    not leave''), introspection, spiritual undertones. WORD COUNT ISSUE: 880 words
    exceeds 800-word ceiling by 80 words (10% over). This is a material constraint
    violation despite strong content quality.'
