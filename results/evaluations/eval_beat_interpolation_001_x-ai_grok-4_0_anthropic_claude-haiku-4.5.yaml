  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Marcus\
    \ introduced as wise mentor figure with clear backstory ('former adventurer'),\
    \ (2) Practical wisdom delivered ('Adventuring isn't just swinging swords...your\
    \ librarian's eye for patterns') plus tangible tools (satchel with luminous ink,\
    \ notebook, compass), (3) Elena's doubt shifts convincingly from 'I can't do this'\
    \ to 'Maybe ordinary was enough' with authentic reluctance ('her voice lacked\
    \ its earlier bite'), (4) Librarian skills reframed as valuable ('deciphering\
    \ clues, piecing together forgotten lore'). All must-not violations avoided: Elena\
    \ remains doubtful/reluctant (not confident), Marcus explicitly doesn't accompany\
    \ her, setting is village/shop (not forest), no magical powers discovered. Character\
    \ voice consistent throughout\u2014Elena's self-deprecation and analytical nature\
    \ maintained. Bridge between beats seamless: BEFORE ends with refusal, GENERATED\
    \ shows internal conflict leading to mentor encounter, AFTER shows threshold crossing\
    \ with Marcus's wisdom echoing. Continuity perfect: map, grandmother's ghost,\
    \ village setting all preserved. WEAKNESS: Word count (575) significantly exceeds\
    \ requirement (200-350), representing 64% overage. This is the only deficiency\u2014\
    narrative execution is exceptional."
