  evidence: 'All 12 Hero''s Journey beats are explicitly present and well-articulated:
    Ordinary World (opening paragraph), Call to Adventure (dream + elders'' request),
    Refusal of Call (fear of failure), Meeting the Mentor (grandmother''s journal),
    Crossing the First Threshold (departure for mountain), Tests/Allies/Enemies (forest
    creatures, treacherous trails, self-doubt), Approach to Inmost Cave (reaching
    desolate shrine), Ordeal (surrender and creation), Reward (completed vessel),
    Road Back (descent with weight of transformation), Resurrection (spiritual rebirth
    understanding), Return with Elixir (spring restored + Maya''s mastery). All 7
    core elements preserved: Maya as protagonist, pottery/ceramics central, grandmother''s
    legacy woven throughout, mountain shrine journey detailed, dried spring as catalyst,
    surrender theme explicit (''let the clay guide her hands''), transformation arc
    complete. Tone is consistently quiet and meditative with philosophical depth.
    Minor deduction (0.05) for structural accuracy: the Allies/Enemies beat could
    be slightly more integrated into the broader narrative arc rather than appearing
    as a discrete section. Tone score 0.95 (not 1.0) because while meditative and
    transformative, it occasionally approaches lyrical rather than maintaining strict
    quietness throughout.'
