  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The mentor, Marcus,
    is introduced and provides guidance (doubt as a compass, knowledge of stories
    as a tool) and a practical tool (journal). Elena's doubt is still present but
    shows a flicker of acceptance at the end. Her librarian skills are explicitly
    referenced as useful. All 'must not' conditions are avoided. Character consistency
    is strong, and the bridge between beats is seamless, with Marcus's words echoing
    in the 'AFTER' beat.
