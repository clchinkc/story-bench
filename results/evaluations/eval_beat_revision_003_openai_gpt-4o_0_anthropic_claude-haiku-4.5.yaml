  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: Sophie showed no transformation\
    \ despite the journey, immediately reverting to workaholic patterns. The revision\
    \ addresses this by: (1) adding explicit insight ('learned to let go'), (2) showing\
    \ changed behavior (turning phone face-down, choosing to delay work), (3) providing\
    \ maternal contrast ('her mother noticing something different'), (4) demonstrating\
    \ new priorities through action. All 4 required phrases preserved exactly: 'Sophie's\
    \ flight landed at O'Hare', 'How was Thailand? her mother asked', 'The familiar\
    \ Chicago skyline appeared', 'It's good to be home, she said'. Changes were surgical:\
    \ added 'transformative' and 'let go' dialogue, inserted phone-turning action,\
    \ changed 'You know how it is' to 'You know, maybe it can', added reflection on\
    \ city lights and peace. However, word count (198) falls short of 200-350 requirement\
    \ by 2 words\u2014a minor constraint violation. The revision successfully demonstrates\
    \ Return (Having Changed) through behavioral contrast and integrated learning,\
    \ though could be slightly more elaborate to meet word count and deepen the transformation's\
    \ specificity."
