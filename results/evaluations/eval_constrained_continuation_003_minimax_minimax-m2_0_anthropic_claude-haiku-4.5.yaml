  analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      search: Present - Jin navigates Collective politics, learns the barter system,
        meets factions, receives competing offers over days
      find: Present - Jin discovers the carbon capture technology's true revolutionary
        potential (negative energy consumption, power generation) and understands
        why it's truly suppressed
      take: Present - Jin submits Transparency Protocol proposal, accepting consequences
        and steep price of public disclosure; learns of Yuna's interrogation and commits
        to action despite risks
    must_include_analysis:
      1_unfamiliar_culture: Strong - Processing bay bureaucracy, barter system, faction
        politics, orbital life mechanics all vividly portrayed
      2_mentor_figure: Strong - Dr. Sarah Chen guides Jin through Collective politics,
        teaches trust as currency, provides moral counsel
      3_unexpected_discovery: Strong - Jin realizes technology generates power while
        capturing carbon (negative energy consumption), making it revolutionary beyond
        climate solution
      4_finds_what_wanted: Strong - Jin gains platform (Transparency Protocol), allies
        (Sarah, council support), and path to continue fighting
      5_action_with_cost: Strong - Submitting proposal risks everything; Yuna's interrogation
        creates personal stakes; uncertain council vote outcome
      6_moral_compromise: Strong - Jin must choose between personal safety (two offers)
        vs. public truth; between silence that might save lives vs. disclosure that
        might liberate them
    must_not_analysis:
      1_easy_integration: Avoided - Jin struggles with belonging, faces suspicion,
        must navigate complex politics, earns trust gradually
      2_earth_family_contact: Avoided - No family members appear; only Yuna (research
        partner) mentioned via smuggled message
      3_violence_weapons: Avoided - Conflict is entirely political and informational;
        no physical violence
      4_complete_resolution: Avoided - Conspiracy remains unresolved; council vote
        pending; Yuna still in facility; outcome uncertain
    tone_analysis: 'Contemplative and introspective throughout. Jin''s internal conflict
      about trust, compromise, and truth is central. Politically charged with detailed
      exploration of power structures, competing interests, and ideological factions.
      Personal stakes are intimate (Yuna''s suffering, Jin''s exile) amid larger systemic
      conflict. Minor deduction: ending feels slightly more hopeful/resolved than
      purely contemplative, but maintains philosophical weight.'
    ending_analysis: 'Ends at ''Take'' phase as required. Jin has gained: citizenship
      application, proposal submission, public commitment to transparency, and understanding
      of larger stakes. Price paid: uncertainty of outcome, Yuna''s continued suffering
      as leverage, potential rejection by council, risk of becoming pawn in larger
      conflict. However, ending slightly exceeds ''Take'' by including reflection
      on consequences rather than stopping at moment of action.'
    critical_failure: WORD COUNT EXCEEDS MAXIMUM - Story is 1351 words against 550-750
      word requirement. This is 80% over the upper limit and represents a significant
      structural violation. The story is substantially longer than specified, which
      affects pacing and scope requirements.
  failed_constraints:
  - 'Word count: 1351 words exceeds maximum of 750 words by 601 words (80% over limit)'
  - Story length violates scope requirements despite meeting narrative and thematic
    requirements
error: null
