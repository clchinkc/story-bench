  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - ''Things going according to plan (mostly)'': The plan deteriorates significantly
    by mid-passage with the discovery of military-grade encryption and Helena''s presence.
    While this serves the narrative, it undercuts the ''mostly successful'' requirement
    of Fun and Games, which should establish crew competence before complications.'
  - 'Beat 3 - ''Public/party setting intensifies pressure'': The action has moved
    entirely to lower decks/engine room. While the Grand Prix roaring past provides
    atmospheric callback, the immediate setting lacks the glamorous party pressure
    that should characterize this beat''s escalation.'
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional Chekhov''s Gun execution: The engine room exit is established as
    Miri''s planned route, then revealed as Helena''s playbook, creating perfect setup-payoff
    mechanics.'
  - 'Masterful tonal escalation: Beat 1 opens with dry wit (''Belong hard enough and
    doors opened themselves''), Beat 2 shifts to tension (''The name hit like ice
    water''), Beat 3 becomes existential dread (''The painting or Ava'').'
  - "Mentor presence perfectly calibrated: Helena moves from unknown (Beat 1) \u2192\
    \ revealed as antagonist (Beat 2: 'She's been waiting for you specifically') \u2192\
    \ active threat (Beat 3: direct confrontation)."
  - 'Leo''s arc is consistent and plot-critical: Serves as voice of reason in Beat
    1 (technical support), becomes concerned in Beat 2 (warns about encryption), actively
    opposes Miri''s revenge impulse in Beat 3 (moral anchor).'
  - 'Context maintenance is near-perfect: Miri''s dry wit, meticulous planning, and
    moral complexity shine throughout. Monaco setting, yacht, Grand Prix all woven
    naturally.'
  - "Clever problem-solving demonstrated: Keycard lift, retinal scan spoofing, fire\
    \ suppression distraction\u2014all show crew competence."
  - 'Stakes raised dramatically: From ''retrieve painting'' to ''Helena designed the
    security'' to ''choose between mission and crew member''.'
  - "Coherence: The narrative flows logically from reconnaissance \u2192 execution\
    \ \u2192 complication \u2192 moral crisis."
  weaknesses:
  - 'Beat 1 complications arrive too quickly: The military encryption discovery and
    Helena reveal happen within the same passage, compressing the ''mostly successful''
    phase.'
  - 'Ava''s characterization is thin: While Leo has clear arc and voice, Ava remains
    functional rather than dimensional across the beats.'
  - 'The final cliffhanger, while effective, leaves the actual choice unresolved:
    Narratively sound for a three-beat excerpt, but the ''painting or Ava'' dilemma
    isn''t explored enough to fully land the emotional weight.'
  - 'Minor: ''Montblanc pen'' detail is clever but the retinal scan transfer via contact
    lens feels slightly underexplained for plausibility.'
  calibration_notes: "Scored 0.87 on beat requirements (13/15) rather than 0.9+ because\
    \ two requirements are genuinely underserved, not just subtly handled. The cross-beat\
    \ constraints are executed with professional precision\u2014this is where the\
    \ excerpt excels. Context score 0.95 (not 1.0) because Ava lacks dimension. Coherence\
    \ 0.92 because the pacing is slightly rushed in Beat 1. Overall, this is a strong\
    \ 0.8-0.85 range story: it satisfies the core brief with sophistication, but has\
    \ minor structural gaps that prevent 'exceptional' rating."
