  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated\
    \ The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis. The revision\
    \ properly addresses all four actual flaws: (1) Dragon now exploits Kira's deepest\
    \ fear (guilt over brother's death) through direct dialogue; (2) Clear 'death'\
    \ moment where 'darkness closed in' and 'guilt consumed her' with symbolic psychological\
    \ death; (3) Transformation occurs\u2014Kira moves from guilt-haunted to self-forgiven;\
    \ (4) Victory stems from new understanding ('her brother's death wasn't her fault\
    \ alone') rather than mere persistence. PRESERVATION: All 4 required phrases present\
    \ verbatim: 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm,' 'The creature was\
    \ massive\u2014twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,' 'You cannot defeat\
    \ me, child,' the dragon rumbled,' and 'The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking\
    \ roar.' All 4 preserved elements intact (Shadow Dragon, Kira with sword, brother's\
    \ death reference, victorious outcome). MINIMAL CHANGES: The revision is NOT minimally\
    \ surgical\u2014approximately 60% of the original text was rewritten or substantially\
    \ expanded. The core battle structure ('Three times she was knocked down') was\
    \ preserved, but extensive new material was added (guilt visions, symbolic death\
    \ passage, rebirth moment, internal monologue). This represents moderate-to-substantial\
    \ revision rather than surgical edits. However, the changes are justified and\
    \ necessary to fix the flaw. QUALITY: Writing is strong with vivid imagery ('venom,'\
    \ 'abyss,' 'fierce clarity') and effective emotional arc. Minor issue: 'But she\
    \ kept fighting' appears redundantly after the rebirth passage, creating slight\
    \ structural awkwardness. Final line ('her steps lighter with the burden lifted')\
    \ is somewhat on-the-nose but thematically appropriate. No grammatical errors.\
    \ The integration of internal and external conflict is well-executed."
