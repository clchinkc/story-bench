  evidence: 'The model clearly addressed the actual flaw (Sophie returning unchanged)
    by giving her concrete, demonstrable change: she uses a meditation breath, chooses
    to delay work, places the phone face-down and later switches to airplane mode,
    and her mother explicitly notices (''That''s new''). These actions show a new
    perspective and behavior consistent with the Return (Having Changed) beat. The
    revision preserved all four required elements/phrases and kept the mother and
    airport setting. Changes were moderate and additive (additional sentences showing
    transformation) rather than a wholesale rewrite, hence a high but not maximal
    minimal_change_score.'
