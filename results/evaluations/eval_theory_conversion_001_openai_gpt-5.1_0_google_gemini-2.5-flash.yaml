  evidence: The word count is significantly over the requested range. While all beats
    are present, the 'Climax' and 'Falling Action' feel a bit drawn out, blurring
    the sharp distinction between them that Freytag's Pyramid implies. The confrontation
    with Nexus is a strong climax, but the immediate aftermath (Samira walking out,
    then the press conference) could be more tightly integrated into a single 'Climax'
    beat before moving to 'Falling Action' (the public release and its consequences).
    However, the core elements and overall structure are well-represented.
