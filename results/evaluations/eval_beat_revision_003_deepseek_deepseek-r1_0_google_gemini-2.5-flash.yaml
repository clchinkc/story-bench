  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to show
    Sophie's transformation upon returning. It addressed this by having Sophie respond
    differently to work stress, apply a lesson from the retreat ('breathed deeply
    as the monks had taught her', 'Some fires burn themselves out if you stop fanning
    them'), show a behavioral marker of change (silencing the phone, new perspective
    on the city), and have her mother notice the change ('Her mother blinked. 'Are
    you sure?''). The changes were surgical, primarily focused on Sophie's internal
    monologue and actions related to the phone, and her mother's reaction, while preserving
    the core narrative structure and required elements.
