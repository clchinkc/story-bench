  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are present: Exposition (Samira''s status and
    discovery), Rising Action (quarantine, escalating cases, Nexus connection), Climax
    (confrontation/press conference and release of the cure), Falling Action (immediate
    aftermath and legal/PR fallout), Denouement (six weeks later, containment and
    Samira''s new equilibrium). All six core elements are preserved (protagonist,
    engineered virus, Raj, Nexus, public cure release, career sacrifice). Deduction
    on structural_accuracy_score (-0.1) because the press conference functions as
    both climax and falling-action marker in places, creating a slight compression
    of stages; otherwise structure maps well. Tone preserved strongly (medical-thriller
    tension + ethical weight), minor deduction (-0.1) for occasionally compressed
    pacing and concise wording. Word count is invalid: 413 words (outside required
    500–700).'
