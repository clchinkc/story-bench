  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Exposition establishes Samira''s expertise and the anomalous discovery with atmospheric
    detail (''protein structure refused to resolve''). Rising Action escalates through
    failed antivirals, adaptive pathogen behavior, and the Nexus revelation. Climax
    peaks at the confrontation with Nexus lawyers and the decision to go public. Falling
    Action covers the press conference detonation and information release. Denouement
    provides genuine resolution with Samira''s new equilibrium—ruined but alive, ethically
    intact. All 6 core elements preserved: protagonist, engineered virus, Raj, Nexus
    antagonist, public cure release, career sacrifice. Tone is consistently tense,
    medically credible, and ethically weighted throughout. DEDUCTIONS: Word count
    (1065) exceeds target range (500-700) by 365 words (+52%), which violates the
    constraint. This is a significant structural requirement failure despite excellent
    narrative execution. Structural accuracy docked slightly (0.95 vs 1.0) because
    the conversion adds substantial new material (Nexus meeting, press conference
    details) beyond the source material—while this enriches the story, it technically
    expands rather than converts the original beats. Tone remains excellent but could
    be marginally sharper in the denouement (0.95 vs 1.0).'
