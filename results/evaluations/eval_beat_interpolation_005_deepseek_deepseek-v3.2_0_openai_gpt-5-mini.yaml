  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability
    (his confession about ''the wall'' and his father''s death), their relationship
    shifts from strictly professional to personal (sharing the meal and emotional
    space), a clear shared moment creates genuine connection (the tortilla and silent
    meal), and Maya explicitly chooses to stay and deepen her commitment (''She was
    staying''). None of the forbidden items appear (no declaration of love or excessive
    intimacy, no contract breach or decision to leave, no photograph scene, and Alejandro
    lowers his defenses rather than remaining closed). Character behavior and setting
    remain consistent with prior setup, so no deductions were necessary.'
