    of military action violates must-not constraint'
  analysis:
    beats_analysis: 'All three required beats are clearly present and well-executed:
      SEARCH (Jin navigating the Collective''s culture, learning its rules, reverse-engineering
      the tech); FIND (discovery of the secondary isotope-extraction function and
      energy monopoly conspiracy); TAKE (Jin leaking the data, accepting consequences,
      paying the price of potential war and Collective fracture).'
    must_include_analysis: 'All 6 elements successfully integrated: (1) Jin navigates
      Collective politics/culture through processing, Bazaar, and station hierarchy;
      (2) Elias serves as mentor, explaining rules and consequences; (3) Unexpected
      discovery of isotope extraction and energy monopoly hidden beneath climate narrative;
      (4) Jin finds safety/platform in the Collective and opportunity to continue
      his fight; (5) Jin takes action (leaking data) with explicit costs (Collective
      fracture, potential war, personal vulnerability); (6) Moral compromise evident
      in Jin''s choice to weaponize the data and Elias''s reluctant complicity.'
    must_not_analysis: 'Successfully avoided easy integration (Jin struggles with
      unfamiliar tech, gravity, culture, trust issues) and complete resolution (conspiracy
      remains active, conflict escalating). However, VIOLENCE CONSTRAINT VIOLATED:
      The ending introduces military threat (''Earth''s fleet just scrambled a patrol''),
      which crosses into weapons/conflict territory despite being implied rather than
      explicit. Contact with Earth family is successfully avoided.'
    tone_analysis: Contemplative and politically charged tone maintained throughout.
      Personal stakes are visceral (Jin's exile, separation from Yuna, moral dilemmas).
      Political dimensions are sophisticated (energy monopolies, corporate suppression,
      systemic corruption). Philosophical weight in Elias's warnings about justice
      vs. survival. Minor deduction for ending's shift toward action-thriller pacing.
    ending_analysis: 'Ends appropriately at TAKE beat with Jin having gained knowledge,
      platform, and agency, but paid significant prices: loss of Earth contact, Collective
      trust compromised, personal safety jeopardized, potential war triggered. However,
      ending slightly overshoots into consequence revelation rather than stopping
      at the moment of choice/action.'
    critical_issues:
    - Word count violation is substantial (39% over) and significantly impacts constraint
      compliance
    - Military/weapons language in final section violates must-not constraint despite
      thematic appropriateness
    - Ending could be tightened to stop at transmission moment rather than consequence
      cascade
  overall_score: 0.72
  score_justification: Strong narrative execution with all story beats and character
    elements present. Tone and thematic depth are excellent. However, two hard constraint
    violations (word count and violence reference) prevent higher scoring. The story
    demonstrates sophisticated understanding of Story Circle mechanics but fails technical
    requirements that would be non-negotiable in professional contexts.
