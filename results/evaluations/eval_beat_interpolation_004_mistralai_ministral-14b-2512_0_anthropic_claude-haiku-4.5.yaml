  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently.\
    \ (1) Direct examination: Thomas questions Dr. Okonkwo about signing off on trials\
    \ leading to deaths. (2) Near-recant moment: Her wavering voice, darting eyes\
    \ to defense table, visible fear\u2014she appears ready to recant under pressure.\
    \ (3) Thomas's decisive action: He reveals the independent trial arrangement at\
    \ St. Agnes, then delivers the moral ultimatum about living with the truth, directly\
    \ influencing her decision. (4) Turning point: Her confession 'I lied because\
    \ I was scared. But I won't lie anymore' is the irrevocable pivot. All must-not\
    \ items avoided: she struggles internally before testifying, Thomas actively influences\
    \ outcome (not passive), defense doesn't win, no deus ex machina (the trial arrangement\
    \ was foreshadowed in BEFORE). Character consistency: Thomas balances prosecutor\
    \ aggression with moral complexity; Dr. Okonkwo's fear and eventual courage ring\
    \ true. Bridge: Seamlessly connects BEFORE's setup (fear in her eyes) to FALLING\
    \ ACTION's aftermath. Continuity: Courtroom setting maintained, Judge Wright present,\
    \ all details align. DEDUCTION: Word count exceeds limit by 11 words (461 vs 450\
    \ max), a minor technical violation that doesn't affect narrative quality."
