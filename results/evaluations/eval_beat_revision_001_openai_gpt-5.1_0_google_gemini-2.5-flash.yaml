  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment lacked the internal,
    transformative elements of The Ordeal. It addressed all four points of the actual
    flaw: (1) The dragon exploits Kira''s guilt over her brother''s death, making
    it a confrontation with her deepest fear. (2) Kira has a ''death'' moment where
    she lies on the ground, accepting her fate and believing she belongs with her
    brother. (3) A rebirth/transformation occurs when she remembers Taren''s sacrifice
    and reinterprets her past, leading to a new understanding. (4) Victory comes from
    this new understanding and calm, not just persistence. The changes were significant
    to achieve this, but it retained the core structure and many original lines, making
    it a strong revision rather than a complete rewrite. The word count is over the
    limit, which is a minor issue.'
