  evidence: The converted text only covers Act 1 Setup. It introduces Kenji, his lost
    career, estranged daughter, and the wedding invitation as the inciting incident.
    The 'Debate' from Save the Cat is partially covered, but the text cuts off before
    fully establishing the First Plot Point (Kenji deciding to go to Kyoto). Elements
    like Haruki, the business deal temptation, and the ending are not yet present.
    The word count is significantly low, preventing further development of the structure
    and elements.
