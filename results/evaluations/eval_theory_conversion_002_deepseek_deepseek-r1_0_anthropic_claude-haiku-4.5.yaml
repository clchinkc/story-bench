  evidence: "All 12 Hero's Journey beats are present and clearly articulated: (1)\
    \ Ordinary World\u2014Maya's quiet pottery life; (2) Call to Adventure\u2014dry\
    \ spring, elders' plea; (3) Refusal\u2014'I'm not her,' fear of failure; (4) Meeting\
    \ the Mentor\u2014grandmother's journal discovered; (5) Crossing the Threshold\u2014\
    leaving the sea, mountain path begins; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies\u2014mountain's\
    \ indifference, stubbornness as ally, doubt as enemy; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave\u2014\
    internal struggle, building fire; (8) Ordeal\u2014unshaping herself, fighting\
    \ control; (9) Reward\u2014vessel creation and understanding of new legacy; (10)\
    \ Road Back\u2014descent with vessel, temptation to abandon; (11) Resurrection\u2014\
    spring ceremony, transformation validated; (12) Return with Elixir\u2014water\
    \ and wisdom of surrender. All 7 core elements preserved: Maya (protagonist),\
    \ pottery/ceramics (central), grandmother's legacy (journal, techniques), mountain\
    \ shrine (three-day journey), dried spring (catalyst/problem), surrender theme\
    \ (explicit throughout), transformation (complete arc). Tone is consistently quiet,\
    \ meditative, and transformative with lyrical language ('sea breeze constant,'\
    \ 'clay breathes,' 'reborn as the vessel'). Minor deduction (0.05) for structural\
    \ accuracy: the 'Tests, Allies, Enemies' beat could be more distinctly separated\
    \ as individual stages rather than compressed. Minor tone deduction (0.05): one\
    \ moment ('Despair threatened to drown her') slightly more dramatic than meditative,\
    \ though it recovers quickly."
