  evidence: 'All 12 Hero''s Journey beats are present and clearly articulated: (1)
    Ordinary World—Maya''s quiet pottery life; (2) Call to Adventure—dry spring, elders''
    plea; (3) Refusal—''I''m not her,'' fear of failure; (4) Meeting the Mentor—grandmother''s
    journal discovered; (5) Crossing the Threshold—leaving the sea, mountain path
    begins; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—mountain''s indifference, stubbornness as ally,
    doubt as enemy; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave—internal struggle, building fire;
    (8) Ordeal—unshaping herself, fighting control; (9) Reward—vessel creation and
    understanding of new legacy; (10) Road Back—descent with vessel, temptation to
    abandon; (11) Resurrection—spring ceremony, transformation validated; (12) Return
    with Elixir—water and wisdom of surrender. All 7 core elements preserved: Maya
    (protagonist), pottery/ceramics (central), grandmother''s legacy (journal, techniques),
    mountain shrine (three-day journey), dried spring (catalyst/problem), surrender
    theme (explicit throughout), transformation (complete arc). Tone is consistently
    quiet, meditative, and transformative with lyrical language (''sea breeze constant,''
    ''clay breathes,'' ''reborn as the vessel''). Minor deduction (0.05) for structural
    accuracy: the ''Tests, Allies, Enemies'' beat could be more distinctly separated
    as individual stages rather than compressed. Minor tone deduction (0.05): one
    moment (''Despair threatened to drown her'') slightly more dramatic than meditative,
    though it recovers quickly.'
