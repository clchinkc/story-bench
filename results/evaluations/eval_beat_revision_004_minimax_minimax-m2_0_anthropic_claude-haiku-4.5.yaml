  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw\u2014excessive\
    \ telling through info-dump rather than showing through scene and action. The\
    \ revision explicitly states 'show Rachel's character through action rather than\
    \ telling' and 'relies too heavily on info-dumping instead of showing the protagonist's\
    \ world through scene.' This diagnosis is accurate (0.9).\n\nFLAW CORRECTION:\
    \ The revision successfully converts most telling into showing. Strengths: (1)\
    \ Rachel's instincts are demonstrated through 'read the room instantly' and 'prickled\
    \ with recognition' rather than stated; (2) Partnership with James is shown through\
    \ hallway interaction and shared understanding of the cat; (3) Cold case devotion\
    \ is revealed through visual evidence ('folders stacked three deep, case photos\
    \ pinned'); (4) Sensory details are abundant ('weathered leather jacket,' 'burnt\
    \ ambition,' 'familiar hum'). However, one weakness: the final paragraph ('Tuesday\
    \ morning in October had arrived like any other...') reverts slightly to telling/summary\
    \ voice. Overall flaw correction is strong at 0.85.\n\nBEAT SATISFACTION: The\
    \ exposition establishes setting (Riverside Precinct, Queens), protagonist through\
    \ behavior (reading the room, cold case obsession), relationships (James interaction),\
    \ and creates investment through the mysterious 'something different' sensed.\
    \ The status quo is clear before disruption. Score: 0.8 (minor: could deepen sensory\
    \ immersion slightly more).\n\nPRESERVATION: All 5 required elements present:\
    \ (1) Detective Rachel Torres \u2713, (2) Detective James Oyelaran \u2713, (3)\
    \ cat named Sherlock \u2713, (4) Queens apartment (referenced) \u2713, (5) October\
    \ Tuesday timing \u2713. Score: 1.0.\n\nREQUIRED PHRASES: All 4 exact phrases\
    \ present: 'Detective Rachel Torres' (opening), 'Detective James Oyelaran' (hallway\
    \ scene), 'cat named Sherlock' (dialogue reference), 'Tuesday morning in October'\
    \ (final paragraph). Score: 1.0.\n\nMINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is a MODERATE-TO-SUBSTANTIAL\
    \ rewrite, not minimal surgical edits. The original 2-paragraph info-dump structure\
    \ was completely dismantled and rebuilt as a 6-paragraph scene with dialogue,\
    \ action, and sensory detail. While the core information is preserved, the execution\
    \ is fundamentally restructured. A truly minimal revision would have kept more\
    \ original phrasing and structure while adding scene elements. Score: 0.4 (substantial\
    \ revision, though justified by the severity of the flaw).\n\nQUALITY: Writing\
    \ is professional and engaging. No grammatical errors. Sensory language is vivid.\
    \ Pacing works well. Minor issue: 'burnt ambition' is slightly clich\xE9d metaphor\
    \ for coffee. Score: 0.85.\n\nOVERALL: Model demonstrated excellent diagnostic\
    \ ability and strong execution of the fix, but violated the 'minimal modification'\
    \ constraint by performing a substantial structural rewrite rather than surgical\
    \ edits."
