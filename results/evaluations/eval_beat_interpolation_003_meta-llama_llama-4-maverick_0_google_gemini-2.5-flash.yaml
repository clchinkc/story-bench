  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas (crew
    quarters, mess hall, medical bay, lab), discovers clues (Dr. Patel''s log, Commander
    Reyes''s message), encounters transformed crew members (shadow, figures coalescing),
    and overcomes a challenge (using scanner, running, mapping energy readings). All
    ''must not'' items are avoided. The beat clearly executes the ''Search'' function
    by having Yuki actively investigate and face obstacles without immediately finding
    the solution. Character and continuity are consistent, and it bridges well to
    the ''After'' beat by setting up the discovery of the data core in Lab Seven.'
