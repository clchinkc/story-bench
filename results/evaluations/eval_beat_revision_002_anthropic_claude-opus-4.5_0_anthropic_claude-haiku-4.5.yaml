  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: Marcus still had multiple
    viable options (fundraiser, grant, new location, support system) when All Is Lost
    requires complete devastation with no path forward. The revision systematically
    eliminates all escape routes: (1) Denise''s betrayal removes his closest ally
    AND reveals complicity in the sale, (2) Grant rejection confirmed, (3) Fundraiser
    failed ($847 raised), (4) Personal financial crisis (wife''s call about house/bank),
    (5) Whiff of death achieved through loss of identity/purpose and the 23 kids who
    will be failed. Marcus moves from ''setback with hope'' to genuine rock bottom—emotionally
    isolated, financially ruined, professionally defeated. All four required phrases
    preserved verbatim: ''Marcus stared at the eviction notice,'' ''Thirty days to
    vacate the community center,'' ''There has to be something we can do, said Denise,''
    ''He rubbed his temples.'' All four story elements preserved: Marcus as protagonist,
    community center setting, eviction crisis, Denise present. Changes were surgical
    but not minimal—approximately 65% of original text retained, with substantial
    additions (Denise''s betrayal scene, grant rejection detail, wife''s call, photo
    montage reflection, final despair paragraph). The additions are necessary and
    justified to fix the flaw; they don''t constitute bloat. Writing quality remains
    strong with no new errors. The emotional arc now properly executes the All Is
    Lost beat with appropriate devastation, isolation, and hopelessness.'
