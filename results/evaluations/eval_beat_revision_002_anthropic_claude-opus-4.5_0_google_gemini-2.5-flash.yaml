  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment did not convey
    a true 'All Is Lost' moment. It addressed the flaw by removing Marcus's options
    (fundraiser failed, grant rejected), isolating him (Denise's betrayal, wife's
    call about the house), and showing him genuinely giving up hope. The 'whiff of
    death' is present metaphorically through the loss of his program and purpose,
    and the betrayal. The changes were significant enough to achieve the 'All Is Lost'
    beat but retained the core elements and initial setup of the original segment.
