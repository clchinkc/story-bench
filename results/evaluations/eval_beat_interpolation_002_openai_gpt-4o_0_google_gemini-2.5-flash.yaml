  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The 'Debate' beat's
    narrative function is clearly fulfilled, showing Sarah wrestling with her options
    before committing to a new path. All 'must not' items were successfully avoided.
    Character voice and continuity are strong, and the bridge to the next beat is
    seamless.
