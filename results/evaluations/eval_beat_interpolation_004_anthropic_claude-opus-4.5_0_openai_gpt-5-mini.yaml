  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Thomas's direct examination,\
    \ an apparent recant, Thomas taking decisive action that influences her, and the\
    \ turning point where she confesses. The scene functions clearly as the climax\u2014\
    high tension, decisive action, and an irrevocable turning point. No prohibited\
    \ items were violated; the flash drive is produced by the witness as a result\
    \ of her choice (not an external deus ex machina), so no deductions were made."
