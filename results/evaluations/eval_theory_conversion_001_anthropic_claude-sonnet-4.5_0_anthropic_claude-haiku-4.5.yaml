  evidence: "EXPOSITION (0.95/1.0): Excellently establishes Samira's 15-year reputation,\
    \ stable career, and the Tuesday arrival of Patient Zero with the anomalous protein.\
    \ Minor: could have slightly more world-building detail about the lab environment.\
    \ RISING ACTION (1.0/1.0): Masterfully escalates through 72-hour containment,\
    \ impossible symptoms, failed tests, and the critical discovery that the virus\
    \ is designed. Tension builds methodically. CLIMAX (1.0/1.0): The Nexus confrontation\
    \ with legal threats and senator pressure creates maximum tension at hour 84,\
    \ with Samira's decision to release the cure publicly serving as the turning point.\
    \ FALLING ACTION (1.0/1.0): Press conference chaos, Nexus denials drowned out,\
    \ senator's flight, hollow legal threats\u2014consequences unfold naturally. DENOUEMENT\
    \ (0.95/1.0): Six-week resolution showing containment, federal investigation,\
    \ Samira's unemployment, and her new equilibrium at the community clinic. Slightly\
    \ brief but effective. All 6 elements preserved: protagonist (Samira), engineered\
    \ virus, Raj, Nexus antagonist, public cure release, career sacrifice. Tone maintains\
    \ medical thriller tension throughout with ethical weight in the climax and resolution.\
    \ Structure follows Freytag's pyramid precisely with clear escalation and de-escalation.\
    \ Minor deductions only for exposition depth and denouement expansion."
