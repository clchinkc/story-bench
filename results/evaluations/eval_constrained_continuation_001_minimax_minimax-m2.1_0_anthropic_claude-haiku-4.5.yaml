  failed_constraints:
  - 'Word count exceeds maximum: 826 words vs. 700-word limit (126 words over)'
  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'Approach to the Inmost Cave: Excellently executed through the narrowing tunnel
      passage, Zara''s internal fear confrontation, and the symbolic stone door requiring
      blood sacrifice'
    - 'The Ordeal: Powerfully rendered as a drowning/rebirth sequence in the underground
      lake, stripping away identity and fear, emerging transformed'
    must_include_present_detail:
    - 'Choice between escape and helping Tomás: Zara catches Tomás dangling over the
      void and chooses to save him despite time pressure and personal stakes'
    - 'Trap requiring thief skills: The trap door mechanism that Zara identifies and
      disables using her expertise in reading stone wear patterns'
    - 'Tomás''s true motivation revealed: His confession about his dead daughter and
      three-year search, driven by guilt rather than altruism'
    - 'Zara confronting fear of failure: Explicit moment in the tunnel where she whispers
      her deepest fear about the cure being a myth'
    - 'Symbolic death/rebirth in Ordeal: The drowning sequence where she loses her
      identity and emerges transformed'
    - 'Zara emerging changed: Narrative explicitly states ''she was no longer the
      girl who had entered'' with shifted motivation from running from death to running
      toward life'
    tone_assessment: Tense and morally complex throughout. Desperate hope evident
      in Zara's sacrifice for Tomás and her internal struggle. Minor deduction only
      for slight unevenness in pacing near the end.
    ending_assessment: 'Excellently meets requirement: Zara has passed through the
      Ordeal (emerged from the lake transformed) but faces immediate new complication
      (Scorpion Guild arrival with mysterious older force). Sets up next stage perfectly.'
    strengths:
    - Both required beats are fully realized and thematically rich
    - All six must-include elements seamlessly woven into narrative
    - Excellent character development and emotional depth
    - Morally complex choices presented authentically
    - Symbolic language and imagery throughout
    - Strong ending that honors the requirement while maintaining momentum
    weaknesses:
    - 'Word count violation: 126 words over limit (18% excess) - significant constraint
      failure'
    - Could trim some descriptive passages without losing impact
  overall_assessment: Exceptional narrative execution with professional-quality storytelling.
    All content requirements met perfectly. Single critical failure is the word count
    constraint, which is objective and measurable. The story demonstrates sophisticated
    understanding of Campbell's monomyth structure and delivers compelling character
    work with genuine moral complexity. The constraint violation prevents a perfect
    score despite the quality of the work.
