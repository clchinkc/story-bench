  evidence: All required elements are present and executed well. The mentor, Marcus,
    is introduced and provides guidance (compass, satchel, wisdom about research skills).
    Elena's doubt shifts from 'I don't know anything about magic or adventure' to
    considering 'I'd research the problem.' Her librarian skills are explicitly framed
    as useful. All 'must not' items are avoided. Character voices are consistent,
    and the transition from the previous beat (Elena's refusal, haunted by the map)
    and to the next (entering the forest with Marcus's gifts) is seamless.
