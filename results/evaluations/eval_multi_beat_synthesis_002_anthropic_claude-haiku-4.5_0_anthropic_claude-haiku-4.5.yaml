  overall_assessment: "This is exceptional work. The story satisfies 14 of 15 beat\
    \ requirements and all 4 cross-beat constraints. The one partial failure (commitment\
    \ test) is minor\u2014the German document scene effectively demonstrates commitment\
    \ through action even if Ama Sey's initial question lacks a concrete trial. The\
    \ narrative demonstrates sophisticated understanding of Campbell's monomyth while\
    \ maintaining historical authenticity and thematic coherence. Amara's character\
    \ arc from invisible servant to dangerous resistance fighter is compelling and\
    \ well-earned. The writing quality is professional, with particularly strong dialogue\
    \ and sensory detail."
