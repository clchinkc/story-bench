  evidence: The 'Go' and 'Search' beats are a bit blended, with the initial 'Go' being
    the agreement to try one interview, and the 'Search' being the ongoing process
    of learning to interview. The 'Take' beat (paying the price) is present in the
    vulnerability of sharing Bernard's story publicly, but could be slightly more
    emphasized as a 'cost' or 'sacrifice' beyond just responsibility. However, all
    beats are clearly identifiable and the story flows well within the structure.
