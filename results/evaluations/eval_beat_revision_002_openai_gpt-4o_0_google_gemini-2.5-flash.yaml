  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true 'All Is Lost' moment. It addressed the flaw by eliminating Marcus's options
    (fundraiser failed, grant rejected), introducing a personal loss/betrayal (Denise
    leaving for the developer, financial strain on family), and showing Marcus genuinely
    giving up hope ('He lowered his head into his hands, the weight of his world crashing
    down.'). The 'whiff of death' is present metaphorically through the loss of his
    purpose, his assistant, and the threat to his family's stability. The changes
    were surgical and effective, building upon the existing text rather than rewriting
    it entirely. All required preserved phrases and elements are present.
