  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Alejandro reveals vulnerability
    (scar), their relationship shifts from professional to personal, a shared intimate
    culinary moment creates connection, and Maya explicitly chooses to stay and commit
    beyond the contract. No prohibited items appear (no declaration of love or overt
    intimacy, no photo, no decision to leave, Alejandro softens rather than remaining
    closed). A small deduction from the bridge_score (0.9) because while the scene
    effectively marks an emotional commitment and shifts agency, the escalation of
    external stakes or a sharper reversal could be stronger to more clearly pivot
    Maya from reactive to fully proactive in the broader plot.'
