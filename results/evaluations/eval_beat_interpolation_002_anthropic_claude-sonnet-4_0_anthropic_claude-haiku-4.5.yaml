  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Recanting
    considered explicitly (''simplest solution sat right there: call the prosecutor,
    claim she''d been mistaken''). (2) Official channels explored through Marcus Webb
    conversation (''put a protection detail on Amy immediately''). (3) Internal conflict
    powerfully rendered through the Amy memory and duty vs. love tension. (4) Third
    option emerges organically from case file review and realization that channels
    are compromised. Debate beat function executed excellently—Sarah wrestles with
    genuine alternatives before committing. Character voice remains consistent, professional
    yet emotionally grounded. VIOLATIONS: (1) ''Break Into Two'' section explicitly
    shows Sarah resigning and going rogue (''Sarah Chen—former detective, current
    vigilante''), which violates the must-not requirement that she shouldn''t already
    have resigned during the Debate beat. This is technically in the AFTER section,
    but the transition is abrupt. (2) The AFTER section begins her vigilante operation,
    which slightly undermines the clean separation between beats. However, the GENERATED
    (Debate) section itself stays within bounds. MINOR ISSUES: Bridge between beats
    is strong but the resignation happens very quickly after the decision, leaving
    minimal space for the Break Into Two beat to breathe. Continuity is excellent—apartment
    setting, timeline (70 hours), character relationships all maintained. Word count
    valid at 334 words.'
