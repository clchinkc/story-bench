  evidence: 'All four three-act beats are clearly present: Act 1 (ordinary world,
    inciting letter, decision to go), Act 2A (village life, Haruki, midpoint of blossoming
    hope), Act 2B (business temptation, Yuki''s rejection/complication, decision turning
    point), Act 3 (apology/climax at the wedding, denouement with the bamboo shop).
    All eight required elements are preserved. Deductions applied: word count is outside
    the required 550–750 range (provided text ~1322 words), so word_count_valid is
    false. Minor, small deductions from perfect structural_accuracy and tone scores
    because a couple of beats (notably the exact midpoint/second-plot-point labels)
    are blended into scenes rather than explicitly signposted, and the prose is slightly
    more lush than the strictly minimalist "quiet" aesthetic requested. Overall mapping
    and tone are excellent.'
