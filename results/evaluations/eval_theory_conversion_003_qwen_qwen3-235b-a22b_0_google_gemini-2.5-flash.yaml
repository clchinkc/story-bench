  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the three-act
    structure, with clear divisions for setup, confrontation, and resolution. All
    8 core elements are preserved, and the quiet drama, Japanese aesthetic, and redemptive
    tone are consistently maintained. The word count is slightly under the requested
    range. The structural accuracy is good, but the Act 2B (Second Plot Point) could
    be slightly more distinct in its impact on Kenji's immediate actions, rather than
    just an internal realization.
