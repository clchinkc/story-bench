  evidence: "The model did not state that no revision was needed. Instead it rewrote/expanded\
    \ the original Dark Night of the Soul segment (adding lines like 'The gallery\
    \ was gone; her mother\u2019s spirit felt irretrievably lost.' and other sentences),\
    \ which constitutes an unnecessary revision. While the rewrite demonstrates some\
    \ implicit understanding of the beat (isolation, despair, mortality references),\
    \ the model failed to explicitly recognize the segment as correct or provide explanatory\
    \ reasoning."
