  evidence: All five Freytag beats are present (Exposition, Rising Action, Climax,
    Falling Action, Denouement). All six core elements are preserved (Samira, engineered
    virus, Raj, Nexus, public release of cure, Samira's career sacrifice). Small deductions
    in structural_accuracy (−0.10) because the moment of release is presented during
    the press conference in a way that blurs the strict peak (climax) vs. immediate
    aftermath (falling action), compressing the turning point and its consequence.
    Minor deduction in tone (−0.10) because a few passages resolve tensions a bit
    quickly and shift into tidy resolution language, slightly softening the sustained,
    gritty medical-thriller tension and ethical weight.
