  evidence: "All four required elements present: (1) Marcus introduced as mentor character\
    \ with clear backstory (map keeper's granddaughter reference, missing arm, prior\
    \ journey); (2) Practical wisdom and tools provided (compass, journal, rope, cloth-wrapped\
    \ object; explicit guidance about forest testing intentions not abilities; librarian\
    \ skills reframed as asset); (3) Elena's doubt shifts to reluctant acceptance\
    \ (moves from 'I don't want to be here' to 'She took it, surprised by how right\
    \ it felt in her hands'); (4) Librarian skills explicitly validated ('You're a\
    \ librarian...information is a weapon'). All must-not violations avoided: Elena\
    \ remains doubtful and reluctant (not confident/eager); Marcus explicitly refuses\
    \ to accompany her and doesn't solve problems; setting is village shop, not forest;\
    \ no magical powers discovered. Character voice consistent throughout\u2014Elena's\
    \ internal conflict and practical nature maintained. Bridge seamless: BEFORE ends\
    \ with Elena walking out; GENERATED shows her arriving at shop; AFTER shows her\
    \ at forest threshold with Marcus's teachings internalized. Continuity perfect:\
    \ satchel, compass, and Marcus's words carry through all three sections. Execution\
    \ clearly fulfills mentor beat's narrative function: wisdom transfer, tool provision,\
    \ psychological preparation without problem-solving."
