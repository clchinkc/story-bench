  evidence: 'All four target beats are clearly present: Act 1 (setup, inciting letter,
    decision to go = first plot point), Act 2A (arrival, village life, reconnecting,
    false victory as midpoint), Act 2B (business offer, Yuki''s discovery and uninviting
    = second plot point/all-is-lost), Act 3 (Kenji declines investors, seeks reconciliation,
    wedding moment, denouement with bamboo shop). All eight required elements are
    preserved (Kenji, lost career, Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki, business temptation,
    theme of people over ambition, ending with bamboo shop). Minor deductions from
    perfect scores: structural_accuracy_score reduced slightly because some transitions
    (e.g., the exact placement of the midpoint/false victory could be tightened for
    clearer beats), and tone_score reduced slightly for occasional non-Japanese idiomatic
    phrasing (e.g., "siren call", "false victory") that slightly weakens the otherwise
    quiet, Japanese aesthetic. Overall the conversion is faithful and well-structured.'
