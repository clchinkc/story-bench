  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Sarah explicitly considers recanting,
    she evaluates going through official channels (and discusses this with her partner),
    the internal conflict between duty and saving her sister runs throughout, and
    the conversation with Detective Webb functions as the tipping moment toward the
    third option. None of the prohibited items occur (she does not immediately go
    rogue, no one else makes the decision, she has not already resigned, and there
    is no direct confrontation with Marchetti). The only deduction is a technical
    one: the word count is 409, which falls outside the required 250–400 range.'
