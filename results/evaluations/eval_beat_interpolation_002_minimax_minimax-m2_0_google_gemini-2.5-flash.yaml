  evidence: The output perfectly executes the Debate beat, showing Sarah wrestling
    with her options, considering recanting, going through official channels, and
    ultimately committing to a third, rogue option. All required elements are present,
    and all 'must not' items are avoided. The character voice is consistent, and the
    bridge to the next beat is clear. The only issue is the word count being significantly
    over the requested range.
