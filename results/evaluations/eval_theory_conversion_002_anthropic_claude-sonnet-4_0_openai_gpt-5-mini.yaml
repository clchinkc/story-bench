  evidence: 'All 12 Campbell beats are represented: Ordinary World (opening), Call
    to Adventure (dried spring/elders), Refusal (Maya resists), Meeting the Mentor
    (grandmother''s letter/journal as indirect mentor), Crossing the Threshold (beginning
    the climb), Tests/Allies/Enemies (mountain tests present though no allies/enemies
    are specified), Approach to Inmost Cave (ruined shrine search), Ordeal (struggle
    with the clay and surrender), Reward (the completed vessel), The Road Back (treacherous
    return), Resurrection (realization of change during the storm/return), and Return
    with Elixir (spring restored). All 7 required elements are preserved. Deductions:
    small structural deduction (-0.10) because ''mentor'' is indirect (letters/journal
    rather than a living mentor) and there are no allies/enemies explicitly shown;
    small tone deduction (-0.05) because while the tone is largely quiet and meditative,
    a few action-oriented phrases (e.g., storms, climbing action) slightly reduce
    uniform quietness though overall transformation is well conveyed.'
