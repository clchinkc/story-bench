  evidence: 'All four required elements present and executed excellently: (1) Direct
    examination of Dr. Okonkwo with specific questions about the audit and adverse
    reactions; (2) Clear near-recant moment where she equivocates and the murmur indicates
    case collapse; (3) Thomas takes decisive action by breaking courtroom protocol,
    revealing knowledge of coercion, and making an emotional/ethical appeal with the
    prayer card; (4) Turning point crystallizes when Patricia shifts from fear to
    defiance and recants her recant with original logs. All must-not items avoided:
    Patricia shows genuine internal struggle and near-recant before testifying; Thomas
    actively influences outcome through confrontation and moral persuasion; defense
    does not win; no external deus ex machina (the logs were already established in
    BEFORE section). Character voices remain consistent—Thomas''s desperation and
    rule-breaking, Patricia''s conflicted fear transforming to resolve, judge''s authority
    challenged. Seamless bridge from BEFORE''s setup of her fear to CLIMAX''s resolution
    of that fear through Thomas''s intervention. Setting continuity perfect—courtroom
    maintained throughout with specific spatial details (witness stand, podium, gallery,
    defense table). Narrative function of climax fully realized: highest tension,
    protagonist''s decisive action, irrevocable turning point, truth prevails through
    character choice rather than chance.'
