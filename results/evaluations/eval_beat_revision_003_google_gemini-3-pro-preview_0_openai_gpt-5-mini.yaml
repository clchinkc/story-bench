  evidence: 'The model appears to have addressed the actual flaw (Sophie showing no
    lasting change) by giving her a clear, specific response that demonstrates transformation:
    she remembers the monk and breath work (a lesson/insight), chooses to power off
    the phone and defer work (changed behavior/priority), and shows a physical marker
    (shoulders drop). The text creates contrast (the skyline is unchanged but she
    no longer feels constricted) which makes the change visible. The mother''s noticing
    is present but subtle (glancing and asking "Everything okay?"), so one minor beat
    (explicit maternal recognition) is a bit understated. Changes to the original
    are minimal and surgical: required phrases and core elements are preserved and
    the revision mostly inserts interiority and a small action to show integration
    rather than rewriting the scene.'
