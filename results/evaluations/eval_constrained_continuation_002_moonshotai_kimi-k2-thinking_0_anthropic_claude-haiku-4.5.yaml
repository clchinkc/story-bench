  analysis:
    beats_present_detail: Fun and Games beat is excellently executed with the viral
      TikTok moment, customer rush, and rhythm-finding between partners. Midpoint
      beat is perfectly placed at the end with the false victory (sold out, made $3k,
      blogger praise) immediately undercut by Smokey Joe's permit revelation raising
      stakes.
    must_include_analysis:
      viral_moment: Present - TikTok of stretching cheese hits 10k views in 20 minutes,
        drives customer rush
      priya_dev_teamwork: Present - Sticky note orders, prep board coordination, tortilla
        catch mid-air, rhythm finding, locking eyes moment
      rival_competitor: Present - Smokey Joe's BBQ owner introduced as antagonist
        with permit leverage
      midpoint_false_victory: Present - Sold out, $3k profit, blogger praise, then
        permit threat revealed
      genuine_connection: Present - 'Their rhythm found them,' tortilla catch, matching
        grins, partnership moment (non-romantic)
      complication_hint: Present - Temp permit expires Friday, lot grandfathered to
        Smokey Joe's uncle, championship requires verified location permits
    must_not_analysis:
      no_romance: Successfully avoided - relationship remains professional partnership
      no_complete_failure: Successfully avoided - business succeeds on opening day
      no_dev_betrayal: Successfully avoided - Dev remains committed partner
      no_external_savior: Successfully avoided - no investor or celebrity endorsement
    tone_assessment: Upbeat and energetic throughout (victory, rhythm, laughter, rocket
      ship metaphor) with building tension (permit concerns, Smokey Joe's antagonism,
      thread-thin stakes). Minor deduction only for slightly rushed pacing in final
      section.
    ending_assessment: Perfect execution of Midpoint beat requirement. Ends with apparent
      success (sold out, $3k, blogger validation) immediately followed by raised stakes
      revelation (permit expiration, lot ownership issue, championship requirement).
      Tension is palpable and sets up clear Act Two conflict.
