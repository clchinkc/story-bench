  evidence: "ELEMENTS FOUND (3/4): (1) Sarah considers recanting\u2014explicitly stated\
    \ as 'simplest path' and 'three words on the stand'; (2) Sarah considers official\
    \ channels\u2014Marcus proposes 'go upstairs. Morrison, Internal, maybe the Feds';\
    \ (3) Internal conflict duty vs. sister\u2014strong tension between 'every victim\
    \ in those files' vs. 'that one person was her sister.' MISSING: No clear moment/conversation\
    \ that tips her toward the third option (going rogue). The tipping point happens\
    \ in the AFTER section, not the Debate beat itself. VIOLATIONS (2/4): (1) Sarah\
    \ has already decided to go rogue by the AFTER section, which violates the spirit\
    \ of the Debate beat\u2014the decision should crystallize during this beat, not\
    \ before it. (2) The resignation and vigilante commitment occur in AFTER, but\
    \ the GENERATED section ends ambiguously ('She had seventy hours left. A laptop...'),\
    \ suggesting the decision is already made rather than being debated. WORD COUNT:\
    \ 218 words vs. required 250-400 (13% under minimum). EXECUTION: The beat shows\
    \ internal wrestling and seeks advice (Marcus), but fails to fully execute the\
    \ Debate function because the actual decision point is deferred to the AFTER section.\
    \ The beat reads more like the tail end of Debate bleeding into Break into Two.\
    \ CHARACTER: Sarah's voice remains consistent\u2014professional, controlled, conflicted.\
    \ BRIDGE: Adequate connection between sections, though the transition is abrupt.\
    \ CONTINUITY: Setting shifts from apartment to desk to car, all plausible within\
    \ timeframe."
