  evidence: The model correctly identified the 'telling' vs 'showing' flaw in the
    original exposition. It revised the segment to show Rachel's character, her relationship
    with James, and her dedication to work through actions and dialogue. For example,
    her detective skills are shown through her scanning reports and her 'eyes narrowed
    slightly'. Her relationship with James is shown through their morning greeting
    and brief interaction. Her devotion to cold cases is shown by her gaze drifting
    to the 'dog-eared and worn' files. Setting details are integrated through her
    walk into the precinct and the description of the cold cases. The cat is referenced
    naturally. However, the changes are not 'minimal' as the original text structure
    was largely abandoned for a new scene. While effective, it's a significant rewrite
    rather than surgical edits. The 'Queens apartment' is mentioned but not really
    'shown' through sensory details, it's still somewhat told. The 'October Tuesday'
    is present.
