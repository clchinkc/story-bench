  evidence: Missing 'Meeting the Mentor' as the grandmother is deceased and her journal
    serves more as a guide than a direct mentor. 'Refusal of the Call' is present
    but very brief. The 'Approach to the Inmost Cave' and 'Ordeal' are somewhat merged
    into the 'Search' phase. The 'Resurrection' is implied but not explicitly a distinct
    beat. Word count is significantly under the requested range.
