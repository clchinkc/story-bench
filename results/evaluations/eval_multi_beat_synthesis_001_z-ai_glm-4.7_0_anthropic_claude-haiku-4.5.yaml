  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1, Req 4 (Dante must prove himself to gain ally): Jax''s trust shift is
    somewhat abrupt. While Dante saves her from the trap, the transition from ''liability''
    to ''grudging respect'' to full ally lacks a clear moment where Dante explicitly
    proves his sobriety/reliability beyond the immediate danger. The proof feels situational
    rather than character-based.'
  strengths:
  - 'Beat 1 (Tests/Allies/Enemies): Exceptionally strong. Jax''s initial distrust
    is visceral (''You reek of withdrawal''). The trap test is concrete and high-stakes.
    Silas serves as the traitor reveal. Dante''s addiction/recovery is woven throughout
    naturally.'
  - 'Beat 2 (Approach to Inmost Cave): Masterfully executed. The golden shimmer of
    Elena''s residue is the symbolic threshold. Dante''s internal conflict about facing
    why she died is explicit and painful. The preparation (goggles, paint can) is
    organic. Doubt is palpable (''tempting him to just let go'').'
  - 'Beat 3 (The Ordeal): Powerful execution. Kael''s attack is spiritual/psychological,
    forcing Dante into symbolic death (reliving the moment of failure). The moment
    of seeming defeat (''It''s over'') is clear. Transformation through acceptance
    (''he wasn''t that junkie anymore'') is earned and moving.'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun: The chrome spray paint introduced by Rosa in Beat 1 becomes the
    literal solution in Beat 3. Perfectly executed.'
  - 'Character Arc: Guilt progression is sophisticated—mentioned as shakes (Beat 1),
    recognized as the actual obstacle blocking the stairs (Beat 2), then transformed
    through acceptance in the ordeal (Beat 3).'
  - 'Rising Stakes: Escalation is clear: initial distrust/trap → confronting personal
    trauma → direct confrontation with killer''s full power.'
  - 'Ally Continuity: Jax is present and essential in all three beats, with evolving
    dynamics.'
  - 'Tone & Context: Noir-tinged melancholy is consistent. The Buckingham Hotel as
    emotional nexus is vivid. Dante''s voice is authentic.'
  - 'Coherence: The narrative flows naturally from encounter to preparation to confrontation.
    Transitions are smooth.'
  weaknesses:
  - 'Beat 1, Req 4 minor gap: Jax''s shift to ally could be slightly more earned through
    Dante demonstrating sobriety/judgment rather than just heroic action.'
  - 'Minor: The ''static in this room'' explanation for Dante''s shakes, while clever,
    could be slightly clearer earlier to avoid ambiguity about his recovery status.'
  overall_assessment: This is an exceptional piece of storytelling that satisfies
    the Hero's Journey framework with sophistication and emotional depth. The three
    beats are clearly delineated, all 15 requirements are met (with only one minor
    gap in explicitness), and all four cross-beat constraints are elegantly satisfied.
    The prose is noir-tinged and evocative. Dante's redemption arc feels earned rather
    than imposed. The integration of his addiction recovery as both character flaw
    and source of strength is particularly well-handled. The story maintains thematic
    coherence while delivering genuine tension and a meaningful resolution.
