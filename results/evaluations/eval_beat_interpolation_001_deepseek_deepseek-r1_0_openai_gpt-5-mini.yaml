  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he provides practical wisdom and tangible tools (satchel and compass); Elena''s
    refusal loosens into reluctant acceptance (knot of refusal loosens, ''I suppose'');
    Marcus explicitly reframes her librarian skills as useful research. The mentor
    does not solve her problems or offer to accompany her; Elena does not suddenly
    become confident or discover magic; setting remains in the village/shop (not the
    forest). The only deduction is word count: the generated passage is 488 words,
    exceeding the 200–350 range, so word_count_valid is false.'
