  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated
    The Ordeal as a mere boss battle lacking internal transformation. The revision
    addresses all four actual flaws: (1) Dragon explicitly exploits Kira''s guilt
    over brother''s death, making the confrontation internal+external; (2) Clear ''death''
    moment when ''Kira staggered to her knees as despair nearly overtook her'' and
    ''abyss of pain'' symbolizes psychological death; (3) Transformation evident in
    ''Emerging from the ordeal transformed—scarred, yet reborn'' and ''embracing both
    her pain and newfound strength''; (4) Victory stems from transcendent courage
    and acceptance of pain, not mere persistence. PRESERVATION: All 4 required phrases
    present: ''Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm'' (exact), ''The creature
    was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes'' (exact), ''"You
    cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled'' (exact), ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed
    with an earth-shaking roar'' (near-exact: ''an'' vs ''a''). All 4 preserved elements
    intact (antagonist, protagonist+sword, brother''s death reference, victory). MINIMAL
    CHANGES: Score 0.55 because while core structure preserved, the revision substantially
    expands internal monologue, adds philosophical reflection (''abyss of pain,''
    ''transcendent courage,'' ''chains of guilt''), and extends emotional processing.
    This is moderate expansion rather than surgical edits—approximately 40% new material
    added for thematic depth. QUALITY: Writing is professional, no errors introduced,
    prose quality elevated with metaphorical language (''spark of transcendent courage,''
    ''mirror of her deepest fears''). The expansion serves the beat requirement but
    exceeds minimal-change constraint.'
error: null
