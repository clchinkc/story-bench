  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Marcus still had multiple
    viable options (fundraiser, grant, new location) and intact support systems, creating
    a ''setback'' rather than ''rock bottom.'' The revision systematically eliminates
    all escape routes: (1) Grant deadline passed due to Denise''s negligence—betrayal
    + lost opportunity, (2) Denise abandons him mid-crisis—isolation + loss of support
    system, (3) Wife''s text signals marital strain—personal relationship deteriorating,
    (4) Fundraiser now pointless—final option eliminated, (5) Board withdrew support—institutional
    abandonment, (6) Emotional tone shifts from ''we''ll figure this out'' to ''nothing
    left to fight with''—genuine hopelessness achieved. The ''whiff of death'' is
    multi-layered: metaphorical death of his identity (15-year program director losing
    his center), his marriage (kids asking where he is), and his purpose (no kids,
    no center, no future). All four required phrases preserved verbatim: ''Marcus
    stared at the eviction notice in his hands,'' ''Thirty days to vacate the community
    center,'' ''"There has to be something we can do," said Denise,'' and ''He rubbed
    his temples.'' All four story elements preserved: Marcus as protagonist, community
    center setting, eviction crisis, Denise present. Changes were surgical—original
    opening maintained, then layered in Denise''s confession, her job departure, wife''s
    text, and Marcus''s internal collapse. No new errors introduced; prose quality
    remains professional with strong emotional resonance. Minimal_change_score at
    0.75 (not 1.0) because while core structure preserved, significant new dialogue
    and emotional beats were added rather than purely surgical edits, though this
    was necessary to fix the flaw.'
