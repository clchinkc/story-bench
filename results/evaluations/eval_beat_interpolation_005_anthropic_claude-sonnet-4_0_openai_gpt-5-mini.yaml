  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Maya uncovers Alejandro''s vulnerability
    (the accident and his grief), their relationship shifts from professional to personal
    (walls crumbling, shared meal), a genuine shared moment (late-night cooking, tortilla
    served), and Maya makes an explicit choice to commit emotionally beyond the contract
    (''Because you matter to me''). None of the forbidden items occur (no preexisting
    love, no decision to leave or breach, no photograph, Alejandro lowers his guard).
    Character behavior and setting remain consistent with the provided before/after
    beats.'
