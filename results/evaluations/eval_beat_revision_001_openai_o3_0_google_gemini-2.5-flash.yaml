  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed all aspects of the Ordeal
    flaw. It introduced Kira's deepest fear (guilt over her brother's death) as exploited
    by the dragon, included a clear 'death' moment where she surrenders to the dark,
    showed a transformation/rebirth where she gains new understanding, and had her
    victory stem from this new insight. The changes were significant enough to fix
    the flaw but still maintained the core structure and many original phrases, demonstrating
    a good balance of minimal change while achieving the fix. All required preserved
    phrases are present, and the four elements are preserved.
