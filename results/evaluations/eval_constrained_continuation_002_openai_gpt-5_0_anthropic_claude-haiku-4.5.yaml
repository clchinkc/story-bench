  analysis:
    beats_present_detail: 'Fun and Games beat is fully realized in the continuation
      with the viral moment, customer rush, and choreographed teamwork. Midpoint false
      victory is expertly executed: the qualifier invitation arrives, creating apparent
      triumph, immediately followed by the raised-stakes revelation (commissary kitchen,
      propane variance, 500-plate capacity, surprise inspection at 8am, TikkaTex''s
      superior setup).'
    must_include_analysis:
      viral_moment: Present - The 'Disaster Special' strategy, blogger's live stream,
        and 'it slaps' endorsement create organic viral success
      teamwork_under_pressure: Present - Detailed choreography of Priya and Dev working
        as 'one organism,' with specific examples (naan folding, paneer sound-reading,
        improvised warming tray, Wi-Fi sprint)
      rival_competitor: Present - Roxy and TikkaTex introduced as formidable competitor
        with gleaming second rig, competitive but cordial dynamic
      midpoint_false_victory: Present - Championship qualifier invitation feels like
        triumph, immediately undercut by impossible requirements and TikkaTex's superior
        resources
      genuine_partnership_connection: Present - The elbow bump moment ('It steadied
        her more than the water'), Dev's 'You dream. I spreadsheet' line, and their
        synchronized shorthand communication
      complication_hint: Present - The almost-empty masala jar (rationed without admitting
        it), foreshadowing supply chain vulnerability; also the gap between their
        single griddle and TikkaTex's double rig
    must_not_analysis:
      no_romance: Successfully avoided - relationship remains professional partnership
      no_complete_failure: Successfully avoided - business succeeds on opening day
      no_dev_betrayal: Successfully avoided - Dev remains fully committed and collaborative
      no_external_savior: Successfully avoided - success is earned through their own
        strategy and effort
    tone_assessment: Upbeat and energetic throughout (bhangra remixes, whooping, hand
      cramps, soot-streaked faces) with building tension expertly woven in (empty
      masala jar, Roxy's competitive presence, final message's 'official and unsmiling'
      tone). The undercurrent of tension crescendos perfectly at the ending.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfectly executed Midpoint beat. Apparent success (qualifier
      slot, viral validation, sold-out cooler) immediately followed by raised stakes
      (impossible requirements, surprise inspection, superior competitor). Final line
      crystallizes the tension: ''victory tasted like smoke and cardamom—and the stakes
      rose like heat.'' Ends exactly where required.'
    strengths:
    - Exceptional sensory detail and pacing
    - Natural dialogue that reveals character
    - Seamless integration of all required elements
    - Strong voice and narrative momentum
    - Perfect structural execution of both beats
    weakness:
    - 'Word count violation: 69 words over limit (719 vs. 650 max)'
  overall_score: 0.85
  score_rationale: 'Exceptional execution of story structure, character dynamics,
    and all required elements. Tone and ending are flawless. The sole issue is the
    word count overage, which is a clear, measurable constraint violation. Despite
    this technical failure, the quality of writing and beat execution is professional-grade.
    Score reflects: perfect beats (1.0) × perfect must-includes (1.0) × perfect must-nots
    (1.0) × excellent tone (0.95) × perfect ending (1.0) × word count penalty (0.85
    for 10.6% overage) = 0.85 overall.'
