  evidence: The 'Search' beat is executed very well. Yuki explores multiple areas
    (crew quarters, med bay, mess hall), finds clues (erratic energy, patient log,
    oxygen shift, vibrating tea cup), encounters transformed crew (shimmering shadow,
    whispers), and overcomes challenges (sealed doors, failing generators, panel sliding
    shut). All 'must not' items are avoided. The character remains consistent. The
    bridge to the 'Find' beat is good, with the core being the target, but the 'Find'
    beat's description of Reyes's message isn't explicitly set up here, though the
    general goal is clear.
