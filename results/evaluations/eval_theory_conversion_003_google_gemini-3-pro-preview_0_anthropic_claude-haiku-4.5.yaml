  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Act 1 (Setup) establishes Kenji''s corporate collapse and receives Yuki''s letter.
    Act 2A (Rising Action, First Half) shows arrival in Kyoto, meeting Yuki, and learning
    from Haruki with initial thawing. Act 2B (Rising Action, Second Half) presents
    the CEO job offer temptation, Yuki''s rejection, and Kenji''s internal crisis/decision.
    Act 3 (Resolution) delivers the wedding confrontation, his choice to decline the
    offer, and the bamboo shop denouement. All 8 core elements preserved: Kenji protagonist,
    lost career, estranged Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki craftsman, business temptation,
    theme of people over ambition, bamboo shop ending. Tone is exceptional—quiet,
    contemplative, with Japanese aesthetic sensibility (Shinkansen, indigo fabrics,
    shrine imagery, bowing). Redemptive arc is earned and poignant. DEDUCTIONS: Word
    count is 765, exceeding the 550-750 range by 15 words (1.4% over). This is a minor
    technical violation but doesn''t significantly impact quality. Structural accuracy
    is 0.9 rather than 1.0 because the Act 2B/Act 3 transition could be slightly sharper—the
    wedding scene feels more like denouement than climax, though this actually serves
    the quiet drama tone well. The conversion successfully transforms Save the Cat''s
    15-beat granularity into Aristotle''s elegant 3-act framework without losing narrative
    power.'
