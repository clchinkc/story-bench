  evidence: "All 8 Story Circle beats are clearly present and well-sequenced: (1)\
    \ You\u2014library refuge, solitude, predictability; (2) Need\u2014unfulfilled\
    \ longing for connection; (3) Go\u2014Ms. Okafor's program invitation, crossing\
    \ threshold into unfamiliar; (4) Search\u2014struggling through interviews, learning\
    \ to listen; (5) Find\u2014breakthrough with Bernard, understanding listening\
    \ as bravery; (6) Take\u2014town hall presentation, taking responsibility for\
    \ his story; (7) Return\u2014summer ends, Zoe returns to ordinary life; (8) Change\u2014\
    continues visiting Bernard, speaks at funeral, applies to journalism programs.\
    \ All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history\
    \ program, Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key relationship), social\
    \ anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic moment), Bernard's\
    \ death (October), journalism school ending. Tone is consistently gentle, intimate,\
    \ and emotionally true\u2014lyrical language ('soft glow of warm light,' 'cocoon\
    \ of silence'), internal emotional authenticity, and focus on connection over\
    \ action. Minor deduction (0.05) on structural accuracy: the 'Take' beat could\
    \ be slightly more distinct as a separate moment of sacrifice/cost, though the\
    \ town hall presentation effectively serves this function. Minor tone deduction\
    \ (0.05): one phrase ('exhilarating and terrifying all at once') edges toward\
    \ melodrama but remains within acceptable bounds."
