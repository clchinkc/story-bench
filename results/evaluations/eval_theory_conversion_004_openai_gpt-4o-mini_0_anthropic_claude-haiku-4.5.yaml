  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are clearly present and well-sequenced: (1)
    You—library refuge, solitude, predictability; (2) Need—unfulfilled longing for
    connection; (3) Go—Ms. Okafor''s program invitation, crossing threshold into unfamiliar;
    (4) Search—struggling through interviews, learning to listen; (5) Find—breakthrough
    with Bernard, understanding listening as bravery; (6) Take—town hall presentation,
    taking responsibility for his story; (7) Return—summer ends, Zoe returns to ordinary
    life; (8) Change—continues visiting Bernard, speaks at funeral, applies to journalism
    programs. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral
    history program, Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key relationship),
    social anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic moment),
    Bernard''s death (October), journalism school ending. Tone is consistently gentle,
    intimate, and emotionally true—lyrical language (''soft glow of warm light,''
    ''cocoon of silence''), internal emotional authenticity, and focus on connection
    over action. Minor deduction (0.05) on structural accuracy: the ''Take'' beat
    could be slightly more distinct as a separate moment of sacrifice/cost, though
    the town hall presentation effectively serves this function. Minor tone deduction
    (0.05): one phrase (''exhilarating and terrifying all at once'') edges toward
    melodrama but remains within acceptable bounds.'
