  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Marcus
    introduced with vivid characterization (gray hair, precise movements, measured
    demeanor); (2) Practical wisdom delivered through compass, notebook, charcoal—tools
    that leverage Elena''s librarian strengths rather than compensating for them;
    (3) Elena''s doubt shifts convincingly from ''I''m not—'' to accepting responsibility
    (''reluctantly, so did she''); (4) Librarian skills explicitly reframed as assets
    (''You notice patterns. You read what others skim''). All must-not violations
    avoided: Elena remains doubtful and hesitant, Marcus explicitly does not accompany
    her, setting remains in the shop/village (not forest), no magical powers discovered.
    Character voice is consistent—Elena''s self-deprecation, Marcus''s measured wisdom,
    the library metaphors throughout. Bridge between beats is seamless: BEFORE ends
    with Elena refusing and walking out; GENERATED shows her returning with guilt,
    meeting Marcus, receiving tools; AFTER shows her at forest edge with those tools,
    ready to cross threshold. Continuity perfect: same map, same grandmother''s house
    reference, same compass and satchel. DEDUCTION: Word count (397) exceeds maximum
    (350) by 47 words, violating the technical requirement. However, this is a minor
    technical violation that does not compromise narrative quality or beat execution.'
