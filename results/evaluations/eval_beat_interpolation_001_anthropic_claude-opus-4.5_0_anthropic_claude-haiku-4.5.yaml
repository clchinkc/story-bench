  evidence: "All four required elements present and well-executed: (1) Marcus introduced\
    \ as mentor character with clear backstory and wisdom; (2) Practical wisdom delivered\
    \ ('pattern recognition,' 'finding connections') and tangible tools provided (satchel,\
    \ compass); (3) Elena's doubt shifts from absolute refusal ('I can't do this')\
    \ to reluctant acceptance ('doubt lighter than it had been'); (4) Librarian skills\
    \ explicitly reframed as valuable ('It's pattern recognition. It's finding connections\
    \ others miss'). All must-not violations avoided: Elena remains doubtful and hesitant,\
    \ Marcus explicitly does not accompany her, setting remains in village/shop (not\
    \ forest), no magical powers discovered. Character voice consistent throughout\u2014\
    Elena's skepticism and Marcus's weathered pragmatism ring true. Bridge between\
    \ beats seamless: BEFORE ends with Elena's refusal, GENERATED shows her seeking\
    \ Marcus and beginning to accept the call, AFTER shows her at forest threshold\
    \ ready to cross. Continuity perfect: satchel and compass from Marcus appear in\
    \ AFTER beat, mentor's advice echoes in Elena's mind, location progression logical\
    \ (village \u2192 shop \u2192 forest edge)."
