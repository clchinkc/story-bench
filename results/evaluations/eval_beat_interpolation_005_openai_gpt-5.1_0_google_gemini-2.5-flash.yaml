  evidence: The character of Alejandro is slightly less 'notorious recluse' and 'most
    difficult man' than the BEFORE implies, but the shift is part of the beat's function.
    The bridge is good, but the BEFORE emphasizes his difficulty more than the GENERATED
    output fully reflects in his initial interaction.
