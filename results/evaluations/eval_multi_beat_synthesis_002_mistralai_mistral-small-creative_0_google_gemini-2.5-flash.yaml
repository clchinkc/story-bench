  - 'Beat 3 - A final obstacle before arrival: The story has Amara arriving at the
    stronghold, then immediately facing an attack. The ''final obstacle before arrival''
    implies something that must be overcome *to get in*, not something that happens
    *after* arrival. While the attack is a significant obstacle, it doesn''t quite
    fit the ''before arrival'' phrasing of this specific requirement.'
