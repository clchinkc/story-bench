  evidence: The output covers Sarah considering going to authorities/official channels,
    her internal conflict, and her decision to take a third option. However, it doesn't
    explicitly show her considering recanting her testimony, which was the direct
    demand from the Catalyst beat. While implied by her internal conflict, it's not
    directly addressed as a 'pro/con' option.
