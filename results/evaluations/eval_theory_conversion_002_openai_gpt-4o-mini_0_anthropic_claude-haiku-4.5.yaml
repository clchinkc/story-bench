  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World - coastal village pottery
    life, (2) Call to Adventure - dry spring crisis, (3) Refusal of Call - hesitation
    and doubt, (4) Meeting the Mentor - grandmother''s journal discovery, (5) Crossing
    Threshold - three-day journey begins, (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies - arduous trek
    through forests, (7) Approach to Inmost Cave - reaching the shrine ruins, (8)
    Ordeal - surrendering control, creating vessel through night, (9) Reward - vessel
    completed at dawn, (10) Road Back - journey home with apprehension, (11) Resurrection
    - placing vessel at spring, water returns, (12) Return with Elixir - WEAK. The
    final paragraph addresses return and transformation but conflates ''Return'' with
    ''Return with Elixir'' rather than clearly separating the resurrection moment
    (water flowing) from the return home and integration. Missing distinct beat separation.
    PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact - Maya protagonist, pottery central, grandmother''s
    legacy woven throughout, mountain shrine journey detailed, dried spring as catalyst,
    surrender theme explicit (''Let the clay speak,'' ''surrendered her control''),
    transformation clear. STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Strong adherence to monomyth structure
    with clear progression through most stages. Minor weakness: Resurrection and Return
    with Elixir blend together rather than maintaining Campbell''s distinction between
    the final test and the homecoming integration. TONE: Meditative and transformative
    maintained throughout with poetic language (''embers of fire,'' ''wet clay,''
    ''shimmering under the sun''). Quiet introspection preserved. Word count: 711
    words, within 600-800 range.'
