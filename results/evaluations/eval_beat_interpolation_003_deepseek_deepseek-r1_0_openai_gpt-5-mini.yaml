  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas
    (crew quarters, med bay, corridor, Lab Seven), discovers clues/logs about phase-shift
    trials, encounters shimmering/transformed crew, and overcomes obstacles (sealed
    bulkheads, acidic vapor, rewiring to bypass lockdown). None of the forbidden items
    appear (no immediate data-core discovery or full explanations from the crew, she
    doesn''t leave, and she didn''t already know about dimensional effects). The only
    deduction is word count invalidity (249 words; required 250-400). Character behavior,
    execution of the Search beat, bridging between beats, and continuity are all strong.'
