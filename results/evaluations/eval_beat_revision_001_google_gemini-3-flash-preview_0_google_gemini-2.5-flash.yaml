  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The
    Ordeal as a mere boss battle and not a transformative crisis. It successfully
    integrated all four required fixes: the dragon exploiting Kira''s guilt over her
    brother''s death, a clear ''death'' moment where she gives up, a rebirth/transformation
    moment where she gains clarity, and victory stemming from this new understanding
    rather than just persistence. The changes were surgical, adding internal monologue
    and dragon dialogue to achieve the transformation, while retaining the core action
    and structure of the original segment. All required phrases were preserved, and
    the overall writing quality is excellent.'
