  evidence: "The revision directly targets the actual flaw: it replaces telling with\
    \ a grounded scene that shows Rachel's habits and instincts (late-night coffee,\
    \ studying cold-case photos, muttering 'Accessory after the fact'), provides sensory\
    \ setting (saxophone, steam, buzzing fluorescent lights, clock blinking), and\
    \ demonstrates her partnership with Detective James Oyelaran through unobtrusive\
    \ interaction (he sets a black coffee on her desk, casual banter). The cat Sherlock\
    \ appears naturally and links to an evidence memory. All five required story elements\
    \ (Rachel as protagonist, James as partner, cat Sherlock, Queens apartment, Tuesday\
    \ morning in October) are preserved, and the four required phrases are present.\
    \ However, the change is not minimal\u2014the piece is effectively rewritten into\
    \ a scene rather than surgically edited, so minimal_change_score is low despite\
    \ faithful preservation. Overall writing quality is high with no new noticeable\
    \ errors."
