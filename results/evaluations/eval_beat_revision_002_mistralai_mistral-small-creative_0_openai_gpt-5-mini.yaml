  evidence: 'The revision addresses the correct flaw: it closes off the protagonist''s
    options (fundraiser failed, sponsors pulled out), shows formal rejection of the
    grant, introduces a personal ''whiff of death'' (Marcus''s father suddenly gravely
    ill), and depicts Marcus emotionally giving up and isolating himself (ignoring/silencing
    his phone, saying ''There’s nothing left''). These changes correctly target the
    All Is Lost beat. Preservation: all four required scene elements (Marcus as protagonist,
    the community center/youth program setting, the eviction crisis, and Denise present)
    are maintained. However one required phrase — ''He rubbed his temples'' — was
    removed (3 of 4 required phrases preserved). Changes were more than surgical:
    the model expanded and deepened the scene (added email text, phone buzzes, father''s
    hospital text) rather than making minimal edits, so minimal_change_score is moderate.
    Overall writing quality is strong with no significant new errors.'
