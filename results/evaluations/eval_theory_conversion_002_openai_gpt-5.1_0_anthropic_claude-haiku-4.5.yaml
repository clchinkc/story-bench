  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World—coastal village pottery life,
    (2) Call to Adventure—dry spring & elder''s request, (3) Refusal—Maya''s initial
    resistance (''I make cups''), (4) Meeting Mentor—grandmother''s journal discovered,
    (5) Crossing Threshold—departure at dawn with red cloth, (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—mountain
    climb, ravens, water finding; villagers as allies, (7) Approach to Inmost Cave—arrival
    at ruined shrine, (8) Ordeal—struggle with clay, learning surrender, (9) Reward—successful
    vessel creation, (10) Road Back—descent with vessel, (11) Resurrection—water returns,
    Maya transformed. MISSING: (12) Return with Elixir is incomplete—text cuts off
    mid-sentence (''The woman who looked back at her was both familiar''). The elixir
    concept (knowledge of surrender, new teaching role) is implied but not fully realized.
    PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact—Maya protagonist, pottery central, grandmother''s
    legacy woven throughout, mountain shrine journey detailed, dried spring as catalyst,
    surrender theme dominant, transformation evident. STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Follows
    Campbell''s 12-stage arc with strong fidelity through stage 11; incompleteness
    of stage 12 prevents perfect score. Pacing and sequencing are logical. TONE: Exceptionally
    maintained—quiet, meditative, introspective voice throughout; transformative arc
    clear. CRITICAL ISSUE: Word count (2174) vastly exceeds target range (600-800),
    representing 172% overage. This is a significant structural violation despite
    excellent narrative quality.'
