  evidence: 'The revision directly addresses the All Is Lost flaw by adding concrete,
    definitive failures: the grant rejection, the fundraiser''s collapse, Denise taking
    a job elsewhere (betrayal/isolation), Marcus''s wife moving out, and a youth''s
    arrest coupled with the counselor''s ''it doesn''t matter'' line — all of which
    create a credible ''whiff of death'' and strip away options/support. The diagnosis
    is correct and largely fully fixed; the emotional tone shifts from disappointed
    to devastated and isolated. The changes were relatively minimal and surgical:
    the opening lines, Denise''s line, and ''He rubbed his temples'' were preserved
    verbatim and the scene structure remains intact, with added sentences to close
    off every fallback. Writing quality is strong with no major errors. Minor deductions
    reflect that some lines are explicit rather than subtle and the rewrite does more
    than the smallest possible edits, but it still preserves core wording and scene
    setup.'
