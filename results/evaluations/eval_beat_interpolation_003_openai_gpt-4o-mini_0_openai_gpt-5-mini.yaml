  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas
    (crew quarters, medical bay), discovers clues (medical reports referencing intra-dimensional
    resonance), encounters transformed crew (shimmering figures who do not fully explain
    events), and faces obstacles (energy surge that knocks her back; she must recalibrate
    and push on). None of the prohibited items occur—she does not immediately find
    the data core or fully understand the transformation, the crew do not directly
    explain everything, she does not abandon the mission, and she did not already
    know about the dimensional change. Character behavior and setting remain consistent
    and the passage cleanly bridges the arrival and the subsequent discovery.'
