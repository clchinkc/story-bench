  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats present and clearly articulated: (1) You—library
    comfort zone established; (2) Need—missing courage/connection implied through
    hiding; (3) Go—enters oral history program; (4) Search—learns interviewing through
    five attempts, discovers listening as courage; (5) Find—breakthrough with Bernard,
    understands what stories mean; (6) Take—town hall presentation, takes public responsibility;
    (7) Return—summer ends, life resumes; (8) Change—applies to journalism, demonstrates
    transformation through action and willingness. All 8 core elements preserved:
    Zoe protagonist, library setting, oral history program, Ms. Okafor as mentor/initiator,
    Bernard Park as key relationship, social anxiety threaded throughout, town hall
    presentation climax, Bernard''s death and funeral speaking, journalism school
    application. Structural accuracy near-perfect: clean three-act progression, clear
    cause-effect between beats, internal logic sound. Tone consistently gentle and
    intimate—lyrical opening, vulnerable voice, emotional authenticity in Bernard
    relationship, reflective ending. Minor deduction: word count 11 words short of
    minimum (489 vs 500), which is negligible but technically invalid per criteria.
    Prose quality and emotional resonance exceed requirements.'
