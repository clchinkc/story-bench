  evidence: The output clearly shows Sarah considering recanting, going to authorities,
    and her internal conflict. The conversation with Marcus helps solidify her decision
    for a third option. All 'must not' items were avoided. The character voice is
    consistent, and the bridge to the next beat is strong.
