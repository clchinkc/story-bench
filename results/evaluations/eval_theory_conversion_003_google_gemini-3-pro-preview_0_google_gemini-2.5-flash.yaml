  evidence: The story successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the three-act structure,
    with clear divisions for setup, confrontation, and resolution. Act 1 covers Kenji's
    corporate downfall and the catalyst of Yuki's letter. Act 2 covers his journey
    to Kyoto, the initial thawing with Yuki, the introduction of Haruki, and the temptation
    of the business deal leading to Yuki uninviting him (midpoint/second plot point).
    Act 3 covers his decision to reject the offer, his presence at the wedding, and
    the final resolution with the bamboo shop. The structural accuracy is good, though
    the transition from the midpoint (Yuki uninviting him) to the second plot point
    (his decision to reject the offer) could be slightly more distinct as a separate
    beat within Act 2B. All 8 elements are preserved, and the tone is consistently
    maintained. The word count is slightly over the specified range.
