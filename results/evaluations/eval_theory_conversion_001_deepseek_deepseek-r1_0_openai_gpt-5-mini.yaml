  evidence: 'All five Freytag stages are clearly present: exposition (Samira''s routine,
    status quo), rising action (cases, containment failures, accelerating mutations,
    investigation), climax (Nexus confrontation and the revelation of the patent/vaccine),
    falling action (press conference and dissemination of sequences), and denouement
    (winter basement lab, new equilibrium). All six required elements are preserved:
    Samira as protagonist, engineered virus discovery, Raj as supporting character,
    Nexus Biotech antagonist, the cure/vaccine being released publicly, and Samira''s
    career/sacrifice (homelessness/new clinic lab). The structure maps cleanly to
    the target theory and the tone maintains medical-thriller tension with ethical
    weight throughout; no deductions applied.'
