  evidence: "The revision directly addresses the identified flaw: the dragon exploits\
    \ Kira's guilt over her brother (internal confrontation), there is a clear symbolic\
    \ 'death' when she surrenders to the darkness and experiences the void, followed\
    \ by a rebirth (eyes snapping open, warrior reborn) and a new understanding (his\
    \ death was not her sin). Victory follows from this insight rather than mere persistence.\
    \ All four required elements/phrases were preserved verbatim or nearly so. Changes\
    \ are moderate \u2014 significant internal material and emotional beats were added\
    \ \u2014 but structural anchors and outcome were kept, so edits were not a complete\
    \ rewrite."
