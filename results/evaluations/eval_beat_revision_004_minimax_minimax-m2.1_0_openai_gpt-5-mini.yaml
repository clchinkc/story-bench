  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw (exposition was telling rather
    than showing) and largely fixed it by converting the summary into a lived scene:
    Rachel arrives with a cold-case file and coffee, reads precinct atmosphere (demonstrating
    instincts), places a coffee by James (showing their partnership via ritual), and
    the cat appears naturally. This addresses requirements 1–4. Remaining issues:
    some telling lines persist (e.g., reputation and father/backstory are still summarized),
    the required phrase ''Detective James Oyelaran'' was not preserved (only ''James
    Oyelaran'' appears), ''Tuesday morning in October'' lost the ''October'' element
    (only ''Tuesday morning'' remains), and there''s a typo (''Sherlick'' instead
    of ''Sherlock''). Changes are moderate rather than surgical—rewritten into a scene—so
    minimal_change_score reflects a balanced rewrite.'
