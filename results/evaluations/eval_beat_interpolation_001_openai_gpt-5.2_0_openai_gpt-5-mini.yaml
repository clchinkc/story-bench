  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name,
    he provides practical tools (compass, satchel, notebook) and concrete advice,
    Elena’s doubt begins to shift toward reluctant acceptance, and her librarian skills
    are explicitly referenced as useful. No prohibited items occur. The only deduction
    is for word count: the excerpt is 397 words, outside the required 200–350 range.'
