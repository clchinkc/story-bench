  failed_constraints:
  - 'MISSING: Discovery of something unexpected about the suppressed technology -
    the carbon capture tech is mentioned in opening but never resurfaces or reveals
    new information in continuation'
  - 'MISSING: Jin taking action that has a cost or consequence - Jin passively receives
    information and guidance; no decisive action with clear costs'
  - 'MISSING: A moral compromise or difficult choice - Jin''s decisions lack ethical
    weight; he simply accepts help and learns'
  - 'VIOLATED: Easy integration into the Collective - Despite surface wariness, Jin
    is quickly assigned quarters, given a datapad, introduced to residents, and connected
    with helpful guides (Kael, Lena, Arin); integration is smooth'
  - 'VIOLATED: Complete resolution of conspiracy plot - The ending states ''Jin emerged
    with a newfound understanding'' and ''discovered hidden alliances, secret projects,
    and the true intentions'' suggesting resolution rather than leaving threads open'
  - 'TONE ISSUE: Ending lacks contemplative weight - The final paragraph (''In the
    end, Jin emerged...'') rushes to resolution with generic language (''newfound
    understanding,'' ''ready to face whatever challenges'') rather than maintaining
    the introspective, politically charged tone established in opening'
  - 'ENDING ISSUE: Does not end at ''Take'' beat - Story concludes with Jin having
    gained understanding but no clear price paid; the ''Take'' beat requires Jin to
    pay a cost for what he''s gained, which is absent'
