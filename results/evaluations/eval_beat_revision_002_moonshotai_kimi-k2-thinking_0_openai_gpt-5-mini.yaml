  evidence: 'The revision addresses the All Is Lost flaw by removing remaining viable
    options and support: the grant is lost (Denise failed to file), the fundraiser
    is now pointless, the board has pulled support, Denise is leaving (betrayal/isolation),
    and Marcus is rendered hopeless—meeting the ''whiff of death'' requirement. Changes
    were moderate but targeted: core lines and scene remain intact (all four required
    phrases and elements preserved), while new details (missed grant, Denise''s departure,
    wife''s distancing) were added to strip options and hope.'
