  evidence: 'All four required elements present: (1) Marcus introduced as mentor character
    with clear authority and experience; (2) Practical wisdom provided (''These are
    a language, child...Who better to read them than someone who spent her life cataloging
    truths?'') and tangible tools (compass, satchel, provisions, journal); (3) Elena''s
    doubt shifts to reluctant acceptance (''She lifted the satchel...more like an
    invitation she could almost accept''); (4) Librarian skills reframed as valuable
    (''Librarians build understanding...The forest doesn''t need another warrior'').
    All must-not violations avoided: Elena remains doubtful and hesitant, not confident;
    Marcus provides guidance but explicitly does not accompany her; setting remains
    in kitchen, not forest; no magical powers discovered. Character voice maintains
    Elena''s intellectual, self-aware perspective while showing subtle shift. Bridge
    between refusal and threshold seamless—Marcus''s mentorship directly enables her
    movement forward. Continuity perfect: map, grandmother''s ghost context, Elena''s
    profession all maintained. Execution exemplary: beat serves its narrative function
    of preparation and perspective shift without solving the core challenge.'
