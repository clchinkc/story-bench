  evidence: The converted story does not follow the three-act structure. It reads
    more like a continuous narrative of Kenji's time in the village rather than distinct
    acts with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and climax. The 'Business
    deal temptation' and 'Ending with bamboo craft shop' elements are missing. The
    'Lost corporate career' is mentioned but not actively part of the plot progression.
    The word count is too low.
