  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The Ordeal
    as a mere boss battle and successfully revised it to include Kira's deepest fear
    (guilt over her brother's death), a symbolic 'death' moment where she almost gives
    up, a transformation where she accepts her guilt, and a victory stemming from
    this new understanding. The changes were significant enough to address the flaw
    thoroughly, but the core structure and many original lines were retained, indicating
    a good effort at minimal change. The word count is slightly over the limit, which
    is a minor issue.
