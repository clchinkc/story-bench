  evidence: The revision clearly addressed the actual flaw (it converted telling into
    showing by placing Detective Rachel Torres in a lived scene with sensory detail,
    action, and interaction with Detective James Oyelaran and the cat Sherlock). It
    shows her fixation on cold cases through behavior (manipulating a photo, internal
    circling of cases) and establishes setting via smells, sound, and precinct activity.
    However, the edit is a near-complete rewrite rather than a minimal surgical change
    (minimal_change_score=0.0). It failed to preserve two of the five required elements
    (Queens apartment and the explicit 'Tuesday morning' timing) and none of the four
    exact required phrases were present (e.g., "Detective Rachel Torres", "Detective
    James Oyelaran", "cat named Sherlock", "Tuesday morning in October"). Word count
    provided with the submission was outside the allowed range (word_count_valid=false).
    Overall writing quality is high with no major new errors, but the constrained-preservation
    requirements were not met.
