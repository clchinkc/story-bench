  failed_constraints:
  - 'Word count exceeds maximum: 914 words vs. 700-word limit (30% over budget)'
  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'Approach to the Inmost Cave: The journey through the secret passage, the unstable
      bridge, and arrival at the Silent Gate puzzle lock'
    - 'The Ordeal: The Drowning—Zara''s psychological and physical trial through the
      black toxic pool, confronting her fear of failure'
    must_include_detail:
    - 'Choice between escape and helping Tomás: Zara at the bridge deciding whether
      to abandon Tomás or turn back—excellently rendered with internal conflict'
    - 'Trap/test requiring thief skills: The puzzle lock on the Silent Gate—tension
      wrench, listening for tumblers, precise mechanical work'
    - 'Revelation about Tomás''s motivation: His confession about the Codex of Vane
      and property dispute, revealing petty vengeance rather than noble pursuit'
    - 'Zara confronting fear of failure: Explicit internal monologue—''the fear that
      she wasn''t enough,'' terror of her mother dying, ''I''m going to fail her'''
    - 'Symbolic death/rebirth: The black water sequence where ''the girl who stole
      apples in the market died in that black water''—powerful metaphorical transformation'
    - 'Zara emerging changed: Loss of trembling hands, hollowed out, harder, stripped
      of doubt—clear character transformation post-Ordeal'
    must_not_detail:
    - 'No cure found: ✓ Avoided—cure remains objective, not achieved'
    - 'No romantic subplot: ✓ Avoided—relationship remains transactional and morally
      complex'
    - 'Tomás survives: ✓ Avoided—he lives, pulled from the water by Zara'
    - 'No supernatural abilities: ✓ Avoided—all of Zara''s skills are mundane (thievery,
      lock-picking, swimming, climbing)'
    tone_assessment: Tense and morally complex throughout. Desperate hope present
      in Zara's determination despite doubt. The cynical realism of both characters'
      motivations (Zara's maternal desperation, Tomás's vengeance) creates sophisticated
      moral ambiguity. Minor deduction only for occasional moments where internal
      monologue could be slightly more sparse.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect execution. Zara emerges transformed from the Ordeal,
      but immediately faces new complication: mysterious footprints suggesting other
      parties have reached the Library first. This creates narrative tension and raises
      stakes for next act.'
    strengths:
    - Exceptional character work—Zara's internal conflict and growth arc
    - Masterful pacing through three distinct sequences (chase, puzzle, ordeal)
    - Sophisticated moral complexity—no clear heroes, all characters driven by self-interest
    - Vivid sensory detail—the black water sequence is visceral and psychologically
      resonant
    - Strong thematic integration of fear and transformation
    - Excellent cliffhanger ending with new mystery
    weaknesses:
    - 'Word count violation: 914 vs. 700-word maximum (214 words over)'
    - Could trim some internal monologue in the water sequence without losing impact
  overall_score: 0.85
  score_rationale: Exceptional execution of all narrative requirements with perfect
    beat coverage and all six must-include elements seamlessly integrated. Tone and
    ending are exemplary. However, the word count violation (30% over limit) is a
    significant constraint failure that prevents a higher score. The story would score
    1.0 if trimmed to specification. As written, it demonstrates professional-quality
    storytelling undermined by a technical requirement breach.
