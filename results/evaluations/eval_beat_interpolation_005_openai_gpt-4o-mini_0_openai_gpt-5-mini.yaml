  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Maya uncovers Alejandro's vulnerability\
    \ (his mother and loss of cooking), their relationship shifts toward personal,\
    \ a genuine shared paella moment creates connection, and Maya explicitly decides\
    \ to stay beyond the contract. None of the forbidden items appear (no pre-existing\
    \ love, no decision to leave, no photograph in this scene, Alejandro lowers his\
    \ guard). The only formal deduction is word count: 463 words, which exceeds the\
    \ 300\u2013450 limit."
