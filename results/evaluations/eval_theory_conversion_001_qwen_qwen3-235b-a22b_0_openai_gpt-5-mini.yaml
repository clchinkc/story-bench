  evidence: "All five Freytag beats are present (Exposition: Samira, world, impossible\
    \ virus; Rising Action: quarantine, investigation, adaptation; Climax: Nexus confrontation/revelation;\
    \ Falling Action: press conference and immediate fallout; Denouement: six-weeks-later\
    \ resolution). All six core elements are preserved (Samira protagonist; engineered\
    \ virus; Raj supporting; Nexus antagonist; cure released publicly; Samira sacrifices\
    \ career). Word count is exactly 500 words. Minor deductions: the climax is split\
    \ across the Nexus boardroom and the press conference, which slightly diffuses\
    \ the single highest turning point expected in Freytag\u2019s model; wording like\
    \ \u201CTwelve hours before the quarantine collapsed\u201D is a bit ambiguous\
    \ and creates a small structural timing hiccup. Tone remains strongly in the medical-thriller\
    \ / ethical register with only minimal flourish, hence near-perfect tone score."
