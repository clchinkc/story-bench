  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats clearly present—Act 1 establishes Kenji''s
    corporate ruin and Yuki''s letter (Setup + Inciting Incident + First Plot Point);
    Act 2A shows village life, Haruki mentorship, and false reconciliation (Obstacles
    + Midpoint); Act 2B reveals investor temptation and Yuki''s rejection (Complications
    + Second Plot Point); Act 3 delivers climax (declining deal, witnessing wedding)
    and denouement (bamboo shop). All 8 core elements preserved with fidelity. Tone
    is consistently quiet, meditative, with strong Japanese aesthetic (shinkansen,
    torii gate, bamboo lattice, paper lanterns, temple). Theme of choosing people
    over ambition is central and earned. DEDUCTIONS: Word count is 530, falling 20
    words short of minimum 550 (4% under range). This is minor but fails the explicit
    requirement. Structural accuracy is near-perfect but slightly compressed in Act
    2B—the complications and second plot point could have more breathing room. Tone
    is exceptional but could deepen the ''dark night of the soul'' moment slightly
    for maximum impact.'
