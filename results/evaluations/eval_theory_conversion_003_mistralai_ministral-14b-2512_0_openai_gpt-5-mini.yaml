  evidence: "All four three-act beats are present: Act 1 (office life, inciting letter,\
    \ decision to go), Act 2A (arrival, initial obstacles, midpoint revelation at\
    \ the festival/Haruki's bowl), Act 2B (complication of letters/investor temptation\
    \ and the moral choice), Act 3 (resolution\u2014apology, decision to stay, new\
    \ life practicing bamboo). Seven of eight required elements are preserved; the\
    \ one missing is an explicit ending with a bamboo craft shop \u2014 the piece\
    \ ends with Kenji practicing and hoping to start again but never clearly opens/establishes\
    \ a shop. Structural deductions: the midpoint and second plot point work but are\
    \ somewhat understated (hence <1.0 structural score). Tone is very strong\u2014\
    quiet drama, Japanese aesthetic, and redemptive arc are well maintained. Word\
    \ count requirement is not met (user-specified range 550\u2013750 vs. provided\
    \ ~1000), so word_count_valid is false."
