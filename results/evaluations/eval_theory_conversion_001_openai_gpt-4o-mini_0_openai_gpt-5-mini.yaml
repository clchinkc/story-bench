  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are present and appear in the correct order: Exposition
    (Samira, lab, status quo), Rising Action (quarantine, escalating cases, discovery
    of Nexus), Climax (decision to go public and confrontation with Nexus at the press
    event), Falling Action (press conference and immediate fallout), Denouement (outbreak
    contained, investigations, Samira''s new equilibrium). All six core elements are
    preserved (Samira, engineered virus, Raj, Nexus Biotech, public release of the
    cure, career sacrifice). Structural mapping to Freytag’s Pyramid is clear and
    faithful, so no deduction there. A small deduction in tone (0.9) because the final
    resolution is somewhat swift and tidy, which slightly reduces sustained medical-thriller
    suspense in the closing paragraphs despite maintaining the ethical weight.'
