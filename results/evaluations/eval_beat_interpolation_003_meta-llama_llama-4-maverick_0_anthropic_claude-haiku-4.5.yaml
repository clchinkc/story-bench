  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Multiple
    location exploration (crew quarters, mess hall, medical bay, lab, Lab Seven) with
    vivid environmental details; (2) Progressive clue discovery through logs and messages
    that build mystery rather than explain it; (3) Encounter with transformed crew
    as mysterious, threatening entities with distorted features and unnatural movement—their
    nature remains ambiguous; (4) Clear obstacle overcome (physical confrontation
    with entities, scanner use as defense, navigation challenge to Lab Seven). The
    Search beat functions authentically—Yuki adapts, learns incrementally, faces genuine
    peril, and pursues the mystery with renewed determination. All must-not violations
    avoided: she doesn''t find the data core yet, crew doesn''t explain themselves,
    she commits to the mission, and she arrives without prior knowledge. Character
    voice remains consistent (methodical, curious, brave). MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Character
    score -0.05 for one moment where ''curiosity piqued'' feels slightly generic;
    bridge score -0.05 because the transition to Lab Seven feels slightly abrupt (though
    narratively justified); continuity score -0.1 for the Chinese text fragment in
    Dr. Patel''s log (appears to be encoding error or unexplained multilingual element
    that creates minor world-building ambiguity, though it could be intentional).
    Overall execution is professional and fully satisfies the Story Circle Search
    beat requirements.'
