  evidence: 'All 4 required elements present: (1) Multiple area exploration—Crew Quarters,
    Medical Bay, high-security research wing with deliberate progression; (2) Clues
    discovered—desiccated meal, exotic particles, Kronin''s serum vials, quantum leakage
    readings; (3) Transformed crew encounters—shimmer entities, humanoid shadow, blurred
    face figure, freezing wind collision; (4) Obstacles overcome—locked blast door
    requiring gravity venting and rewiring, dimensional collision avoidance, navigation
    through hazardous environment. Beat execution is exemplary: Yuki actively searches,
    adapts to threats, makes incremental discoveries, and struggles against environmental/dimensional
    obstacles. All must-not violations avoided: she doesn''t find the data core yet
    (only locates Lab Seven), crew doesn''t explain everything (only Reyes''s cryptic
    encouragement at end), she commits to mission completion, and she arrives without
    prior dimensional knowledge. Character voice remains consistent—scientific, cautious,
    determined. Bridge seamless: transitions naturally from ''Go'' (arrival) through
    ''Search'' (exploration/trials) toward ''Find'' (data core discovery). Continuity
    perfect: Jupiter viewport, life support status, tablet readings, suit details
    all maintained from BEFORE section.'
