  evidence: 'All required elements present: (1) Marcus introduced as mentor character
    with clear backstory hints (scar, retired adventurer); (2) Practical wisdom provided
    (''research,'' ''finding patterns,'' ''cross-reference'') and tangible tools given
    (satchel, compass); (3) Elena''s doubt shifts to reluctant acceptance (''I guess...
    I can always organize the chaos''); (4) Librarian skills explicitly reframed as
    valuable (''You know how to cross-reference... That is what this journey needs'').
    No violations of must-not criteria: Elena remains doubtful/reluctant, Marcus explicitly
    refuses to accompany her (''I can''t go with you''), setting remains at curiosity
    shop (not forest), no magical powers discovered. Character voice consistent throughout—Elena''s
    self-deprecating tone and Marcus''s grandfatherly wisdom maintain established
    personalities. Bridge between beats seamless: shame drives her to Marcus, mentor
    guidance propels her toward forest threshold. Continuity perfect: map and shame
    from previous beat motivate this scene; compass and satchel carry forward to next
    beat. Execution exemplary—this is a textbook Meeting the Mentor beat that transforms
    the hero''s self-perception through wisdom and tools rather than false confidence.'
