  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are present: exposition (Samira''s world and status
    quo), rising action (containment, investigations, Nexus link), climax (confrontation
    at Nexus and the critical revelation/decision), falling action (press conference
    and immediate containment), and denouement (career sacrifice and new equilibrium).
    All six required elements appear: Samira protagonist, engineered virus discovery,
    Raj, Nexus Biotech, public release of the cure, and Samira''s career sacrifice.
    The piece maps cleanly onto Freytag''s Pyramid with sustained medical-thriller
    tension and clear ethical consequences; the climax and immediate aftermath are
    tightly linked but still function as distinct climax and falling-action beats.'
