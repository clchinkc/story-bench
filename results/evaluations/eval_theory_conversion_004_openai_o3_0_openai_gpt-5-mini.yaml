  evidence: 'All eight Dan Harmon beats are clearly present and mapped (You/Need/Go/Search/Find/Take/Return/Change).
    Seven of eight core elements are preserved: Zoe, the library and oral-history
    program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard Park, Zoe''s social anxiety, the town-hall presentation,
    and Bernard''s death are all explicit. I deducted one preservation point because
    the ending implies college applications and a future in storytelling but does
    not explicitly state ''journalism school'' as requested. Structural flow closely
    follows the Story Circle; ''Take'' is used as accepting responsibility (town hall)
    rather than a heavy personal sacrifice, but this fits the target beats. Tone is
    gentle, intimate, and emotionally true throughout.'
