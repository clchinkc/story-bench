  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Alejandro''s vulnerability (grief
    over his mother), the relationship shifts from professional to personal (they
    cook together, his look changes), a shared intimate moment (cooking until dawn),
    and Maya chooses to stay for emotional reasons beyond the contract. No forbidden
    items appear (no photograph, no pre-existing love, no contract breach/decision
    to leave, Alejandro lowers his guard). Character behavior and setting remain consistent
    with prior and subsequent beats.'
