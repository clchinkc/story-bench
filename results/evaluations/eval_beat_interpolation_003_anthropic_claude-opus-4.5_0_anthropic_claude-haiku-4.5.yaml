  evidence: "All 4 required elements present: (1) Multiple location exploration (crew\
    \ quarters, medical bay, research wing, Lab Four, Lab Seven approach), (2) Clues\
    \ discovered progressively (half-empty coffee, chess game, Chen's tablet on quantum\
    \ cellular restructuring, Reyes's emergency log), (3) Mysterious encounter with\
    \ shimmers that retreat when confronted, (4) Obstacle overcome (pressure seal\
    \ bypass using scanner reroute). All must-not violations avoided: data core not\
    \ immediately found (only located at end), crew doesn't explain everything directly\
    \ (only cryptic log and brief Reyes voice), mission continues throughout, dimensional\
    \ transformation remains mysterious until Lab Seven. Character voice remains consistent\u2014\
    scientific mind cataloguing while experiencing fear, methodical progression. Bridge\
    \ seamless: BEFORE ends with arrival, GENERATED shows active search/adaptation,\
    \ AFTER reveals discovery. Setting continuity perfect: station details, emergency\
    \ lighting, scanner readings maintained throughout. Execution exemplifies Search\
    \ beat: struggle evident (fear, obstacles), adaptation shown (scanner bypass,\
    \ cautious exploration), incremental progress clear (clue-to-clue advancement)."
