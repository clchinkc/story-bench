  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are clearly present: Exposition (Samira''s world/status
    quo), Rising Action (72-hour escalation, quarantine, mounting cases), Climax (revelation
    of Nexus + their confrontation), Falling Action (press conference and cure release),
    Denouement (six-week aftermath, containment, Samira blacklisted but at peace).
    All six required elements appear explicitly: Samira, engineered virus, Raj, Nexus
    Biotech, public release of the cure, and Samira''s career sacrifice. The piece
    maintains medical-thriller tension and ethical weight throughout and maps cleanly
    onto Freytag''s five-stage structure, so no deductions were made.'
