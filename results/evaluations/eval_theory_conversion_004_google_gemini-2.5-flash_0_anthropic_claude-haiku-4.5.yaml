  evidence: "All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly mapped: (1) You\u2014\
    library sanctuary, Dewey Decimal comfort; (2) Need\u2014yearning for connection\
    \ despite fear; (3) Go\u2014Ms. Okafor's nudge into oral history program; (4)\
    \ Search\u2014learning to listen, struggling through early interviews, Bernard\
    \ as ally; (5) Find\u2014Bernard's breakthrough confession about Korea; (6) Take\u2014\
    town hall presentation bearing witness publicly; (7) Return\u2014continuing visits,\
    \ library feels different, ordinary life resumes; (8) Change\u2014journalism school\
    \ application, speaking at funeral, standing before strangers. All 8 core elements\
    \ preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history program, Ms. Okafor\
    \ (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key relationship), social anxiety (woven\
    \ throughout), town hall presentation (climactic moment), Bernard's death (October),\
    \ journalism ending. Tone is consistently gentle, intimate, and emotionally true\u2014\
    introspective without melodrama, focusing on internal shifts and quiet moments\
    \ of connection. Minor deduction (0.05) from structural accuracy: the 'Return'\
    \ beat could be slightly more distinct as a separate phase rather than flowing\
    \ into 'Change,' though the narrative handles this elegantly. Word count verified\
    \ at 679 words (within 500-700 range)."
