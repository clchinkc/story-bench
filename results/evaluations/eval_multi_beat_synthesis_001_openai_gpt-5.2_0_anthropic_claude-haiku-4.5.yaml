  detailed_analysis:
    beat_1_tests_allies_enemies:
      score: 0.95
      satisfied:
      - Dante encounters Mina who initially distrusts him ('Addict, then') - establishes
        skepticism
      - 'Test of ability under pressure: Dante uses his gift to read residue while
        managing sensory overload (the panic spike forcing him to anchor)'
      - 'Enemy within revealed: Nico the caretaker exposed as traitor selling Resonant
        locations'
      - Dante proves himself through action (fire extinguisher response) and insight
        (reading the gold thread)
      - 'Addiction/recovery referenced multiple times: ''three years clean,'' the
        urge rising with helplessness, shame tied to sister''s death'
      notes: All five requirements clearly met. Mina transitions from distrust to
        grudging respect by beat end.
    beat_2_approach_to_inmost_cave:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied:
      - 'Planning scene: Mina spreads map, marks attacks, identifies spiral pattern
        toward hotel'
      - 'Guilt recognition: Dante explicitly connects sister''s death to current danger
        (''your guilt is going to be the door he walks through'')'
      - 'Preparation: gathering map, flashlight, salt packets, confessions from other
        Resonants'
      - 'Moment of doubt: ''At the threshold...Dante''s confidence thinned'' and ''hated
        how much his voice shook'''
      - 'Symbolic threshold: sealed ballroom door with layered residue crust, described
        as crossing into danger'
      notes: Exceptionally executed. The threshold is both literal and psychological.
    beat_3_the_ordeal:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied:
      - 'Direct confrontation: killer present in ballroom center, tokens on floor,
        immediate threat'
      - 'Symbolic death: Dante overwhelmed by concentrated black shame, ''hollowing''
        like victims, ''grayness crept along his arms'''
      - 'All seems lost: killer draining Mina, Dante on knees, ''All seemed lost with
        the simplicity of it'''
      - 'Transformation through acceptance: Dante accepts guilt (''I will carry that'')
        rather than fighting it, integrates it as stone not tide'
      - 'Victory through understanding: Dante sees killer''s silver self-loathing
        through prism, recognizes him as fellow sufferer, defeats him with recognition
        not violence'
      notes: 'Minor: the killer''s retreat feels slightly abrupt, though thematically
        sound. The victory is intellectual/emotional rather than physical, which fits
        the noir-fantasy tone.'
    chekhov_gun:
      score: 1.0
      analysis: Rosa's prismatic shard introduced in Beat 1 (found in ashtray, 'like
        a broken compact mirror') becomes essential in Beat 3. It refracts the killer's
        residue, reveals his true nature, and enables Dante to see through the killer's
        gray field. The shard is the literal tool that solves the ordeal.
    character_arc_guilt:
      score: 1.0
      analysis: "Beat 1: Guilt mentioned as urge trigger and shame response to 'junkie'\
        \ slur. Beat 2: Guilt explicitly identified as obstacle ('your guilt is going\
        \ to be the door he walks through'). Beat 3: Guilt transformed from drowning\
        \ force to carried weight ('stone in his pocket\u2014real, carried, not worshiped').\
        \ Clear progression from suppressed to acknowledged to integrated."
    rising_stakes:
      score: 0.95
      analysis: 'Beat 1: Dante discovers mentor dead, traitor identified, personal
        threat emerges. Beat 2: Spiral pattern reveals killer is herding toward hotel,
        Dante realizes killer ''knows me,'' stakes become personal. Beat 3: Direct
        confrontation, Mina actively drained, Dante nearly hollowed, killer''s full
        power unleashed. Stakes escalate logically and emotionally.'
    ally_continuity:
      score: 1.0
      analysis: 'Mina present and essential in all three beats. Beat 1: antagonist-to-ally
        transition. Beat 2: co-planner and strategist. Beat 3: active combatant, extends
        salt line, provides grounding presence. Her arc parallels Dante''s trust-building.'
    context_maintenance:
      score: 0.95
      analysis: 'Protagonist: Dante''s voice, perspective, and emotional journey central
        throughout. Setting: Buckingham Hotel as nexus maintained; Chicago noir atmosphere
        pervasive. Tone: melancholic, determined, redemptive arc clear. Minor: could
        emphasize contemporary Chicago details more, but urban fantasy noir tone is
        consistent.'
    coherence:
      score: 0.92
      analysis: "Narrative flows logically from discovery \u2192 planning \u2192 confrontation.\
        \ Emotional beats align with plot beats. Dialogue feels natural. Pacing accelerates\
        \ appropriately. Minor: killer's characterization could be slightly more developed\
        \ before ordeal (though the reveal is intentional). Transitions between beats\
        \ are smooth."
    strengths:
    - "Exceptional use of synesthetic residue metaphor\u2014colors as emotional language"
    - Guilt integrated as character engine, not melodrama
    - Mina's character arc earned through action and vulnerability
    - Chekhov's gun perfectly executed with prismatic shard
    - "Victory through understanding rather than violence\u2014thematically sophisticated"
    - "Noir tone maintained without clich\xE9"
    - Sensory details vivid and purposeful
    weaknesses:
    - 'CRITICAL: Word count 1952 vs 1000 max (95% over limit) - this is a hard constraint
      violation'
    - Killer's motivation/backstory could be slightly clearer before ordeal
    - Some exposition in Beat 2 planning scene could be tightened
    - Mina's specific gift/ability not fully defined (she 'tastes mood' but limits
      unclear)
