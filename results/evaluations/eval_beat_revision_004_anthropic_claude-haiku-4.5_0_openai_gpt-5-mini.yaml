  evidence: "The model appears to have correctly diagnosed the problem as an info-dump\
    \ telling-style exposition and rewrote the segment to SHOW Rachel through behavior\
    \ (jazz, coffee, Sherlock at her ankles, cold-case file in her bag, phone call\
    \ with James), thus addressing the core flaw. It establishes setting, relationship,\
    \ and her devotion via actions and sensory detail. Changes were moderate rather\
    \ than surgical: all five story elements (protagonist detective, partner, cat,\
    \ Queens apartment, October Tuesday) remain, but the required exact phrases were\
    \ mostly not preserved\u2014only 'Tuesday morning in October' appears verbatim\
    \ (1 of 4). The model also dropped the formal titles ('Detective Rachel Torres'\
    \ and 'Detective James Oyelaran'), violating the constraint to keep character\
    \ names/roles, which reduces the quality score despite generally effective exposition."
