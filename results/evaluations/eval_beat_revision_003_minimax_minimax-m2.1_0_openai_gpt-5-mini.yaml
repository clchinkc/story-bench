  evidence: 'The model addressed the correct flaw: the Return (Having Changed) beat.
    It shows Sophie behaving differently (choosing to wait to call Linda, putting
    the phone in her pocket), includes an explicit internal contrast with her pre-journey
    self, gives a physical marker of change (phone-away habit), and notes her mother''s
    surprise. These changes are concise and focused—most of the original lines and
    structure are retained, with only small surgical edits to insert reflection and
    the altered action. Writing quality is strong with no new errors.'
