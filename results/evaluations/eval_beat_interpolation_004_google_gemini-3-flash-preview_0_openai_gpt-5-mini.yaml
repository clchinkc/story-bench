  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: direct examination, apparent
    recanting, Thomas''s decisive action that influences Patricia, and the turning
    point where the truth prevails. No must-not items occur. Character behavior is
    consistent with established stakes. The climax cleanly bridges the setup and the
    aftermath. Minor, non-deducting ambiguity: ''the judge remained frozen'' could
    be read as ambiguous (presiding judge vs. Thomas''s father), but it does not create
    a continuity error.'
