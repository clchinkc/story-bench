  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are present (Exposition: Samira and status quo;
    Rising Action: quarantine, escalating cases and investigation; Climax: Nexus confrontation/revelation;
    Falling Action: press release and immediate spread of the cure; Denouement: six-week
    aftermath and new equilibrium). All six core elements are retained (Samira protagonist,
    engineered virus discovery, Raj, Nexus antagonist, public release of cure, Samira''s
    career sacrifice). The sole deduction is for word count: the converted piece is
    ~1211 words, outside the required 500–700 range.'
