  evidence: "All five Freytag beats are present: exposition (lab, Samira's status\
    \ quo), rising action (quarantine, mounting cases, investigation), climax (revelation\
    \ of Nexus involvement and the legal summons framed as the crisis peak), falling\
    \ action (press conference and immediate fallout), and denouement (outbreak contained,\
    \ Nexus investigated, Samira ostracized but at peace). All six core elements are\
    \ preserved (Samira, engineered virus, Raj, Nexus, public release of the cure,\
    \ and Samira's career sacrifice). Tone consistently reads as a medical thriller\
    \ with ethical weight. Deduction: structural_accuracy_score reduced slightly because\
    \ the narrative blurs the exact peak \u2014 the press conference functions as\
    \ a very active turning point as well, which could be read as climax rather than\
    \ falling action; this ambiguity prevents a perfect structural rating."
