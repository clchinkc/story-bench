  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the original's three acts to Freytag's
    five stages. Exposition clearly sets up Samira's world and the initial discovery.
    Rising Action details the escalating outbreak and her investigation leading to
    Nexus. Climax is the confrontation with Nexus and her decision to act. Falling
    Action covers the press conference and immediate aftermath of the cure's release.
    Denouement shows the long-term consequences and her new equilibrium. All 6 core
    elements are preserved. The tone of a medical thriller with ethical weight is
    consistently maintained.
