  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he provides practical wisdom and gifts (satchel, brass compass, advice about intentions);
    Elena''s doubt shifts toward reluctant acceptance (''maybe ready wasn''t required'');
    and Marcus explicitly frames Elena''s librarian skills as useful (reading patterns,
    cross-referencing, remembering stories). None of the must-not items occur—Elena
    remains hesitant, Marcus refuses to accompany her, the scene is in Marcus''s shop
    (not the forest), and Elena does not discover magical powers. Character voices
    are consistent and the scene cleanly bridges from refusal to the threshold setup
    with no continuity issues.'
