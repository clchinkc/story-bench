  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: multiple explored areas (corridor,
    Section C, medical bay, junction, Lab Seven), discovery of clues (logs, scorched
    strap, trace organics, garbled REYES line), encounters with transformed crew as
    shimmers/distortions and a flickering Reyes, and a concrete obstacle overcome
    (magnetic lock bypass). The Search beat is clearly executed—Yuki adapts, faces
    trials, and progresses incrementally toward Lab Seven. No prohibited items appear
    in the Search segment (the data core is only found in the subsequent After section).
    The only deduction is that the provided word_count (419) falls outside the requested
    250–400 range.'
