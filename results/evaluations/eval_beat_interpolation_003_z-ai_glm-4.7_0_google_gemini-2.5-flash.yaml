  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas (Crew
    Quarters, Mess Hall, Science Wing), discovers clues (unmade beds, half-finished
    game, sudden absence), encounters transformed crew (translucent figures), and
    overcomes a challenge (locked blast doors). The beat clearly executes the ''Search''
    function, showing Yuki actively navigating and struggling. No ''must not'' items
    are present. Yuki''s character remains consistent, analytical despite fear. The
    bridge to the ''Before'' beat is strong with the echoing voice and emergency lighting,
    and the bridge to ''After'' is set up by her moving towards the Science Wing and
    the mention of the data core. Continuity is maintained throughout.'
