  evidence: "REQUIRED ELEMENTS (4/4 present): (1) Direct examination of Dr. Okonkwo\u2014\
    Thomas methodically builds foundation with credentials, protocols, then moves\
    \ to specific trial data. (2) Near-recant moment\u2014She closes her eyes, grips\
    \ the chair, initially deflects ('I don't recall filing them'), showing internal\
    \ struggle and external pressure (the man with daughter's photo). (3) Thomas's\
    \ decisive action\u2014He physically blocks her line of sight to the threat, makes\
    \ direct eye contact, and delivers emotionally resonant appeal about the seventeen\
    \ victims' families, directly influencing her choice. (4) Truth prevails turning\
    \ point\u2014She breaks, provides specific details (March 15th, 47 adverse events),\
    \ gallery erupts, case direction irrevocably set. MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS (0/4): Avoided\
    \ passive questioning (Thomas actively intervenes); avoided simple truth-telling\
    \ (genuine internal conflict shown); avoided defense winning (guilty verdict confirmed);\
    \ avoided deus ex machina (no new evidence appears\u2014she provides what she\
    \ already had). CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Thomas's voice remains steady, strategic\
    \ yet humane; his violation of 'prosecutorial strategy' is character-appropriate\
    \ given his moral compass established in BEFORE. Dr. Okonkwo's fear, trembling,\
    \ and ultimate choice are psychologically coherent. BRIDGE QUALITY: Seamless transition\
    \ from rising tension to climactic confrontation; the gallery detail, the photograph\
    \ leverage, and Thomas's positioning all connect naturally to the verdict outcome\
    \ in AFTER. CONTINUITY: Setting remains courtroom/hallway; timeline flows logically;\
    \ character states (Thomas's hollowness, Dr. Okonkwo's red eyes) connect directly\
    \ to AFTER section."
