  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas (crew
    quarters, medical bay, corridor), discovers clues (floating mug, log fragments,
    scorched strap), encounters transformed crew (distortion, multiple distortions),
    and overcomes a challenge (locked bay door). All ''must not'' items are avoided.
    Yuki''s character remains consistent, and the narrative flows well from ''Before''
    to ''Generated'' and sets up ''After'' effectively. Setting continuity is perfect.'
