  evidence: 'The revision explicitly addresses the identified flaw: the dragon weaponizes
    Kira''s guilt about her brother (confrontation with deepest fear), Kira experiences
    a symbolic ''death'' (she stops fighting, accepts what the dragon accuses her
    of), then a rebirth/transformation occurs when she recalls her brother''s message
    and rises changed. Victory follows from that new understanding rather than mere
    persistence. The required elements and key phrases are preserved, but the model
    made moderate additions (internal dialogue, memory/revelation, emotional turning
    point) rather than only surgical edits, hence a middling minimal_change_score.'
