  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All four required elements present and executed excellently.
    (1) Vulnerability discovered: Alejandro''s knee injury, decade of isolation, nostalgic
    connection to mother''s cooking reveal emotional wounds. (2) Professional-to-personal
    shift: Explicit transition from ''client'' to ''lonely man'' perspective; Maya
    sees beyond the legend. (3) Shared moment: The sofrito scene creates genuine intimacy
    through sensory detail and mutual recognition—not romantic but deeply connective.
    (4) Commitment deepening: Maya''s explicit realization (''not because it''s in
    the contract, but because you need it'') and her proactive choice to cook ''proper
    dinner'' show stakes shifting from financial to emotional. All must-not items
    avoided: relationship remains pre-romantic (forehead press comes later in AFTER),
    Maya commits rather than leaves, photograph not present, Alejandro''s walls genuinely
    lower. Character consistency strong: Maya''s compassion and Alejandro''s guarded
    vulnerability both ring true. Bridge seamless: connects BEFORE''s contract signing
    to AFTER''s photograph scandal by establishing the emotional bond that makes the
    scandal devastating. Setting continuity perfect: kitchen location, time of night,
    physical details all cohere. Narrative function executed: this is definitively
    a Point of Commitment beat—Maya''s motivation transforms from transactional to
    relational, creating irrevocable emotional stakes for Act 3.'
