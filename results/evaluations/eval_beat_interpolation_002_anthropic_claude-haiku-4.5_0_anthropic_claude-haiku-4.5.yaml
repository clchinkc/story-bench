  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Recanting
    option explicitly considered with logical consequences analyzed. (2) Official
    channels thoroughly debated through Marcus conversation, revealing systemic corruption.
    (3) Internal conflict powerfully rendered through Sarah''s realization that both
    obvious choices lead to failure. (4) The diner scene with Marcus serves as the
    tipping point toward the third option. The Debate beat''s core function—protagonist
    wrestling with decision before committing—is executed with strong narrative tension
    and character agency. Sarah''s voice remains consistent, her reasoning logical
    and grounded in her detective experience. VIOLATIONS: (1) ''Break into Two'' section
    begins with Sarah already having resigned (''former detective, current vigilante'')
    and sitting outside the Marchetti compound—this prematurely resolves the decision
    and crosses into action territory. (2) The AFTER section shows Sarah already committed
    to vigilantism, which technically violates the ''must not include Sarah already
    having resigned'' constraint, though this is the transition beat so some overlap
    is acceptable. However, the resignation happens in the AFTER section, not during
    Debate, so the Debate beat itself stays clean. Deducting for the AFTER section
    bleeding into action/resolution. BRIDGE: Good connection between beats—Debate
    ends with Sarah''s internal clarity (''felt like clarity''), AFTER shows immediate
    action. Minor gap: the 45-minute jump between resignation and surveillance could
    be smoother. CONTINUITY: Apartment setting maintained, character motivations consistent,
    timeline logical (70 hours to trial). Small note: ''case files she''d copied before
    turning in her badge'' is slightly awkward phrasing but doesn''t create contradiction.'
