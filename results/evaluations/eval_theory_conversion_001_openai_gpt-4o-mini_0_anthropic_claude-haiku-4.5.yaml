  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-sequenced.\
    \ Exposition establishes Samira's 15-year reputation and the impossible virus\
    \ discovery. Rising Action spans the 72-hour containment crisis with escalating\
    \ complications. Climax peaks at the dual revelation (engineered virus + Nexus\
    \ connection) and confrontation decision. Falling Action covers the press conference\
    \ chaos and lawsuit threats. Denouement provides bittersweet resolution with career\
    \ sacrifice and new equilibrium. All 6 core elements preserved: protagonist (Samira),\
    \ engineered virus, Raj, Nexus Biotech, public cure release, career sacrifice.\
    \ Word count at 530 is valid (500-700 range). Tone maintains medical thriller\
    \ tension with ethical weight throughout. MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Structural accuracy\
    \ slightly reduced (0.95 vs 1.0) because the transition between Rising Action\
    \ and Climax compresses the 12-hour countdown somewhat abruptly\u2014could benefit\
    \ from more granular pacing. Tone score at 0.9 (not 1.0) because the denouement's\
    \ 'bittersweet peace' slightly softens the thriller tension in final paragraphs,\
    \ though this is narratively appropriate. The conversion successfully transforms\
    \ 3-act linearity into 5-act pyramid structure with proper escalation and de-escalation."
