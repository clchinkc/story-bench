  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Act 1 establishes Kenji''s hollow corporate life and the wedding invitation catalyst.
    Act 2A shows obstacles (clumsy reconnection, Haruki mentorship, fragile hope).
    Act 2B escalates with business rivals'' offer and Yuki''s betrayal. Act 3 delivers
    climax (Kenji''s refusal and apology) and denouement (bamboo shop). All 8 core
    elements preserved: protagonist, lost career, estranged daughter, Kyoto wedding,
    Haruki, business temptation, thematic choice, craft shop ending. Tone is exceptional—quiet,
    contemplative, Japanese aesthetic with poetic language (''watercolor of gray light,''
    ''paper screens,'' ''scent of fresh reeds''). Redemptive arc is earned, not sentimental.
    DEDUCTIONS: Word count is 540, falling 10 words short of minimum 550 (2% shortfall).
    Structural accuracy slightly reduced because Act 2B could more explicitly show
    the ''second plot point'' turning point—the refusal happens somewhat abruptly
    after the confrontation, though the emotional logic is sound. Minor: The transition
    from ''shattered hope'' to ''alone in the inn'' compresses the dark night slightly,
    though it remains effective.'
