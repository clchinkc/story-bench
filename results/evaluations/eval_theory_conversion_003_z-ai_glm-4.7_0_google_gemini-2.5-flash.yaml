  evidence: The story successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the three-act structure,
    hitting all the target beats and preserving all core elements. The word count
    is slightly under the requested range. The structural accuracy is good, but the
    transition from Act 2A to 2B could be slightly more distinct, as the 'Midpoint'
    and 'Complications' blend a bit. However, it still clearly follows the intended
    progression. The tone is perfectly maintained.
