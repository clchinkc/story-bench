  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The Ordeal
    as a mere boss battle and not a transformative crisis. It successfully integrated
    Kira's deepest fear (guilt over her brother's death) into the dragon's dialogue,
    created a clear 'death' moment where she shatters under the weight of her guilt,
    and then provided a rebirth/transformation through her brother's last words and
    a new understanding of her purpose. Victory then comes from this new insight,
    not just persistence. The changes were significant enough to fix the flaw but
    still maintained much of the original structure and narrative flow. One required
    phrase was slightly altered ('The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking
    roar' vs 'The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar').
