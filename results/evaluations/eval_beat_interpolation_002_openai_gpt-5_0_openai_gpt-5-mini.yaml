  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: (1) recant option is explicitly
    considered; (2) going official (calling Morrison/Feds) is weighed; (3) internal
    duty-vs-sister conflict is clear and forceful; (4) a turning moment toward a third
    option occurs (her own realization—spurred by Marcus''s visit and the paint fleck—leads
    her to ''do both''). The passage fulfills the Debate beat''s function of weighing
    alternatives before committing, and it ends with a decisive step toward action
    (''I need the case files,'' offline), which bridges cleanly to the Break Into
    Two. No disallowed items appear (she does not immediately go rogue, no one else
    makes the decision for her, she hasn''t resigned in this beat, and there''s no
    direct confrontation with Marchetti or his people). The only issue: the provided
    word count is invalid (word_count_valid = false) per the specified 250–400 range.'
