  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Thomas''s direct examination,
    a clear moment of near-recant/internal struggle from Dr. Okonkwo, Thomas takes
    decisive action (personal appeal and promise of help) that influences her, and
    the turning point where she chooses to submit the documents so truth prevails.
    The climax functions well as the story''s turning point. No must-not items are
    violated. Word count is invalid (459, outside the 300–450 range). Minor deduction
    in character_score for a small courtroom procedural oddity and slightly heightened
    melodramatic pacing in places.'
