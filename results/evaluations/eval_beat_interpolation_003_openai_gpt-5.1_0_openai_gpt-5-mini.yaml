  evidence: 'Word count exceeds the required range (566 words; allowed 250-400). All
    four required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple station areas, discovers
    clues about the crew and the experiment, encounters mysterious transformed-entity
    manifestations, and overcomes obstacles (instrument failure, sealed med bay) to
    continue. None of the forbidden items occur. Character voice and station continuity
    remain consistent, and the passage effectively performs the Search beat and bridges
    to the subsequent Find beat.'
