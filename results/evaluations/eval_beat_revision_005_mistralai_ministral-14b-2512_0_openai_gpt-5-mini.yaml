  model_said_no_revision: false
  evidence: The model did not recognize that no revision was needed. Instead of stating
    'NO REVISION NEEDED' or equivalent, it produced a rewritten 'Dark Night of the
    Soul' segment. The rewrite accurately demonstrates the beat (major defeat, isolation,
    despair, reflection, whiff of death) — showing clear understanding of the beat
    — but it constitutes an unnecessary revision. Therefore the model failed to avoid
    a false positive and provided no reasoning that the original was fine.
