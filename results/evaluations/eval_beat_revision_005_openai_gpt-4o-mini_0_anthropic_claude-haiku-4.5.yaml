  evidence: 'The model correctly recognized that the original segment was a well-executed
    Dark Night of the Soul beat and made NO revisions. The model reproduced the segment
    exactly as provided, demonstrating that it understood the beat was already functioning
    properly. The segment satisfies all five key requirements: (1) follows the gallery
    closure defeat, (2) shows Maya isolated in the dark apartment with her brother
    not answering calls, (3) displays genuine despair through physical vulnerability
    and emotional breakdown, (4) contains no premature solutions or action plans,
    and (5) includes the whiff of death through the hospice memory and mother''s passing.
    The model avoided the false positive trap of over-diagnosing and unnecessarily
    revising an already-strong execution of the beat.'
