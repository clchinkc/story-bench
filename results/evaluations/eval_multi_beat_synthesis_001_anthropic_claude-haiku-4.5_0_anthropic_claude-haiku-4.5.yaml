      score: 0.95
      satisfied:
      - Dante encounters Marcus who distrusts him initially (jaw tightening, deliberate
        distance)
      - 'Test of ability under pressure: Dante reads emotional residue in basement
        to prove himself'
      - 'Revelation of enemy within community: discovery of traitor reporting to killer
        via black stain of betrayal'
      - Dante proves himself through vulnerability and honesty about sister's death
      - 'Addiction/recovery explicitly relevant: ''three years rebuilding himself,''
        sitting with discomfort without drowning'
      notes: All five requirements fully satisfied with strong integration

      score: 0.95
      satisfied:
      - 'Planning scene: Marcus explains strategy, shows maps with victim locations,
        discusses killer''s methods'
      - 'Dante realizes confrontation requires facing guilt: ''weight of responsibility
        he''d been running from since Marie died'''
      - 'Preparation: maps studied, victim analysis, understanding killer''s knowledge
        of Dante'
      - 'Moment of doubt/fear: ''He thought about walking away. The craving to run
        was familiar'''
      - 'Symbolic threshold: Buckingham doors ''hung open like a mouth,'' ringed with
        Rosa''s grief colors'
      notes: All five requirements satisfied; threshold scene particularly evocative

      satisfied:
      - 'Direct confrontation: killer revealed as Marcus''s twin brother in Buckingham
        lobby'
      - 'Symbolic death: Dante''s guilt weaponized, ''suddenly unbearable,'' knees
        buckle'
      - 'All seems lost: Marcus screaming, killer claims ''You already lost. You''re
        always losing'''
      - 'Transformation through acceptance: Dante stops fighting guilt, lets it ''move
        through him like water through a sieve'''
      - 'Victory through understanding: Dante reads emotional paths, recognizes killer''s
        true motivation (closure about choice)'
      notes: 'Slight weakness: victory relies on Rosa''s residual ability rather than
        purely Dante''s transformed understanding, though this is narratively justified'
    chekhov_gun:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      analysis: The 'black stain of betrayal' discovered in Beat 1 becomes essential
        to understanding the killer's methods and emotional signature. Rosa's colors/connection
        mentioned in Beat 1 becomes the crucial element that breaks the killer's hold
        in Beat 3. The emotional residue reading skill introduced as test becomes
        the mechanism of victory.

      beat_1: Marcus introduced as distrustful ally, trust earned
      beat_2: Marcus present throughout planning, provides tactical information and
        emotional support

        Dante saves him, they exit together
    context_maintenance:
      score: 0.95
      analysis: "Protagonist Dante Reyes fully realized with addiction recovery arc\
        \ central to plot. Contemporary Chicago setting maintained with Buckingham\
        \ Hotel as nexus. Noir-tinged tone consistent throughout\u2014melancholic,\
        \ determined, redemptive. Hidden Resonant underworld well-developed. Serial\
        \ killer threat clear. Only minor: could have emphasized more of Chicago's\
        \ specific geography beyond Buckingham."
    coherence:
      score: 0.92
      analysis: 'Narrative flows logically from distrust to alliance to confrontation.
        Emotional beats align with plot beats. Thematic throughline (guilt as both
        obstacle and source of understanding) maintained. Minor: pacing slightly rushed
        in final confrontation due to word count pressure; killer''s motivation reveal
        could use slightly more setup.'
  strengths:
  - Exceptional integration of addiction recovery as active character trait, not backstory
  - All cross-beat constraints satisfied with sophisticated execution
  - Killer's reveal as Marcus's brother creates powerful thematic resonance with Dante's
    guilt
  - Emotional residue/color system used consistently and meaningfully throughout
  - Transformation through acceptance (not defeat of enemy) aligns perfectly with
    recovery arc
  - Rosa's presence as mentor/ghost element adds depth to victory mechanism
  - Noir tone maintained with strong sensory details and internal monologue
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Word count 63% over limit (1634 vs 1000 max) - violates hard constraint'
  - Final confrontation slightly rushed due to length constraints; killer's backstory
    could be clearer
  - Marcus's role in final victory somewhat passive (Dante saves him rather than collaborative
    triumph)
  - Could strengthen Chekhov's Gun by making traitor reveal more directly relevant
    to final confrontation
  recommendation: 'STRONG CONDITIONAL PASS - Story demonstrates exceptional understanding
    of Hero''s Journey structure and character arc requirements. All narrative and
    thematic elements execute at high level. However, word count violation is objective
    failure of explicit constraint. Recommend: trim 634 words (approximately 39% reduction)
    while preserving core beats. Likely targets: condense basement scene, streamline
    planning exposition, tighten final confrontation dialogue. With revision to meet
    word count, this would score 0.95+.'
