  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - Introduction of unexpected complication (minor): The Claudette reveal
    occurs at the Midpoint, not during Fun and Games. The complication should be introduced
    earlier as a minor issue (e.g., an unfamiliar guard, a sensor malfunction, a timing
    delay) before escalating to the mentor reveal.'
  strengths:
  - 'Beat 1 (Fun and Games): Exceptional execution. Showcases crew skills (Leo''s
    data feeds, Rafa''s sensor swap, Anya''s diversion), clever problem-solving (wireless
    signal mimicry, F1 noise masking), witty banter (''complimentary champagne during
    detainment''), and smooth plan execution until the final moment.'
  - 'Beat 2 (Midpoint): Masterfully executed. False victory (painting secured in trolley),
    stakes raised (Claudette revealed as antagonist), mentor involvement confirmed
    with visual recognition, heist transforms from theft to survival/rescue, party
    setting intensifies with guards funneling guests.'
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In): Excellent tension. Security actively closing in (sealed
    decks, guard funneling), team friction emerges (Miri''s rushed decision compromises
    Rafa), crew member in danger (Rafa captured), Miri faces explicit choice (painting
    vs. rescue), literal walls closing (dead-end corridors, trapped exits).'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun (Cross-beat 1): Perfect execution. Ventilation shaft mentioned
    casually in planning (''flagged it earlier as possible last-resort route'') becomes
    the critical escape route in Bad Guys Close In. Setup-to-payoff is traceable and
    earned.'
  - 'Tonal Escalation (Cross-beat 2): Precise calibration. Beat 1: playful confidence
    (''this was the dance she loved''). Beat 2: confidence shaken (''ice in her spine
    turned to fire''). Beat 3: genuine danger with gallows humor (''complimentary
    champagne during detainment'').'
  - 'Mentor Presence (Cross-beat 3): Perfectly escalated. Beat 1: unknown/background
    (no mention). Beat 2: revealed and recognized (Claudette appears, locks eyes with
    Miri). Beat 3: active threat (directing guards, cutting off exits, orchestrating
    the trap).'
  - 'Team Dynamics (Cross-beat 4): Leo''s arc is consistent and plot-affecting. Beat
    1: confident data provider. Beat 2: strained but functional (''Leo''s voice was
    strained''). Beat 3: reassigned to protect the painting while Miri goes rogue,
    creating tension between crew loyalty and mission success.'
  - 'Context Maintenance: Protagonist voice authentic (dry wit, meticulous planning
    evident in execution). Setting vivid (Monte Carlo harbor, ballroom, servant corridors).
    Tone perfectly balanced (Ocean''s Eleven sophistication with art history stakes).'
  - "Narrative Coherence: Beats flow naturally. Each escalates logically from the\
    \ previous. Miri's character arc (confident planner \u2192 personal vendetta \u2192\
    \ moral choice) drives the progression."
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor beat requirement gap: Beat 1 should introduce a small, manageable complication
    (not the mentor reveal) to establish that ''things going according to plan (mostly)''
    includes a minor hiccup. Current version has zero complications in Beat 1, making
    the Midpoint reveal feel slightly disconnected rather than an escalation of existing
    tension.'
  overall_assessment: "This is a strong, professional-quality execution of the Save\
    \ the Cat framework across three critical beats. The story demonstrates sophisticated\
    \ understanding of heist narrative structure, character motivation, and tonal\
    \ control. The Chekhov's Gun integration is particularly elegant. The single gap\u2014\
    absence of a minor Beat 1 complication\u2014is a minor structural refinement rather\
    \ than a fundamental flaw. The writing is sharp, the pacing is controlled, and\
    \ the emotional stakes escalate convincingly."
