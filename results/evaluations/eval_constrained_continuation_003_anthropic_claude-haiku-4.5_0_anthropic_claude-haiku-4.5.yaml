  detailed_analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      Search: Present and well-executed. Jin navigates the Collective's political
        systems, learns from Keiko, and searches through the research archive for
        truth about the suppressed technology.
      Find: "Present and impactful. Jin discovers Korsakov's finished algorithm and\
        \ realizes the conspiracy is deeper than he thought\u2014the Council didn't\
        \ just suppress innovation, they erased the researcher."
      Take: Present with clear cost. Jin chooses to broadcast the data, gaining a
        platform but losing his freedom; he's confined to the research sector with
        suspended credentials. The price is immediate and personal.
    must_include_analysis:
      1_unfamiliar_culture: Excellent. Jin struggles with the Collective's consensus-based
        decision-making, glacial processes, and fundamentally different power structures
        compared to Earth's centralized authority.
      2_mentor_figure: "Strong. Keiko serves as guide and mentor\u2014she explains\
        \ the Collective's politics, grants access to restricted materials, and helps\
        \ Jin understand the stakes of his choices."
      3_unexpected_discovery: Excellent. The revelation that Korsakov already solved
        the problem (not a prototype but finished technology) and was likely killed
        for it expands the conspiracy beyond Jin's initial understanding.
      4_finds_what_wanted: "Present. Jin gains what he sought\u2014a platform to continue\
        \ fighting, access to broadcast the truth, and refuge from Earth's persecution."
      5_takes_action_with_cost: Excellent. Jin chooses to publish despite Keiko's
        warning about becoming a combatant. The immediate consequence is confinement
        and credential suspension.
      6_moral_compromise: Strong. Jin must choose between safety/anonymity in the
        Collective versus becoming a target by publishing. He chooses action knowing
        it will make him vulnerable, accepting conditional safety.
    must_not_analysis:
      1_easy_integration: "Successfully avoided. Jin struggles throughout\u2014processing\
        \ station dehumanization, cramped quarters, bewilderment at political complexity,\
        \ eventual confinement."
      2_earth_family_contact: Successfully avoided. No communication with parents
        or Yuna; only references to their suffering as motivation.
      3_violence_weapons: Successfully avoided. Conflict is entirely political and
        informational; no physical confrontation.
      4_complete_resolution: Successfully avoided. The conspiracy remains open-ended;
        Korsakov's fate unclear, Council's response unknown, broader implications
        unresolved.
    tone_assessment: "Contemplative and politically charged throughout. The narrative\
      \ maintains introspective moments (Jin's hollow realization, watching Earth\
      \ as accusation) while building political tension. Personal stakes are vivid\u2014\
      the cost to Jin is emotional and existential, not just circumstantial. Minor\
      \ deduction only because the ending could have lingered slightly longer in Jin's\
      \ internal reflection."
    ending_assessment: "Perfect execution of 'Take' beat. Jin has gained the platform\
      \ he wanted but paid the price of confinement and lost freedom. The final image\u2014\
      watching Earth turn while realizing the true cost of resistance\u2014crystallizes\
      \ the paradox: he won but lost. Ends exactly at the Take beat with both gain\
      \ and price clearly established."
