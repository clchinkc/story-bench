  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Alejandro reveals vulnerability
    about taste after surgery; the relationship clearly shifts from professional to
    personal (shared cooking, physical brush, emotional softening); a concrete shared
    moment (sopa de ajo, stirring eggs, first real taste) creates genuine connection;
    Maya explicitly commits beyond the contract (''We’ll keep going... I’m not here
    to perform. I’m here to feed you.'' and ''Tomorrow'' meaning more than the contract).
    None of the prohibited items occur. Character behavior is consistent with the
    setup. The only deduction is word_count_valid=false: the scene is 531 words, exceeding
    the required 300–450 range.'
