  evidence: "The model clearly targeted the All Is Lost problem: it removes the remaining\
    \ options (fundraiser canceled, grant denied), strips Marcus of support (phone\
    \ text from wife leaving, Denise quits and takes a job with the developer), and\
    \ delivers a 'whiff of death' to his identity and purpose (the center reduced\
    \ to a hollow shell, Marcus isolated and resigned). This diagnosis is correct\
    \ and the revision fully fixes the listed flaw. All four required elements/phrases\
    \ were preserved verbatim or with minimal apposition. Changes are not surgical\
    \ \u2014 the writer added several new scenes/dialogue to create the low point\
    \ \u2014 so I rate minimal_change_score as moderate (0.6). Writing quality is\
    \ strong with no notable errors."
