  evidence: The story successfully hits all 12 beats of the Hero's Journey, though
    'Enemies' is very subtle (internal doubt/fear). All 7 core elements are preserved.
    The tone is perfectly maintained. The word count is significantly over the requested
    range, which is the primary deduction for structural accuracy, as it indicates
    a lack of conciseness in adapting the beats.
