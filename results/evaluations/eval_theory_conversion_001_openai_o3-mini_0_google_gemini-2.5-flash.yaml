  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the original three acts to Freytag's
    five stages. Exposition clearly sets up Samira's world and the initial discovery.
    Rising Action details the escalating investigation and the increasing patient
    count. The Climax is well-defined with the Nexus Biotech revelation and the confrontation
    leading to the decision to release the cure. Falling Action covers the press conference
    and the immediate aftermath of the cure's release. Denouement provides the final
    resolution regarding Samira's career and the new equilibrium. All six core elements
    are preserved. The tone is consistent with a medical thriller, maintaining tension
    and ethical weight. The structural accuracy is good, but the Climax feels a little
    drawn out, blending the 'revelation' and 'confrontation' into a single, slightly
    extended paragraph rather than a sharp turning point, which slightly reduces the
    score from perfect.
