  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation\
    \ and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.\
    \ The revision fixes this comprehensively by: (1) Sophie deliberately NOT checking\
    \ her phone despite the urge ('left it there'), (2) explicit insight from retreat\
    \ ('urgency was often a choice'), (3) behavioral marker of change (resisting notification\
    \ light, taking deliberate breath), (4) clear contrast ('The old Sophie would\
    \ already be typing. This Sophie watched...'), (5) mother noticing difference\
    \ ('No work emails? That's a first'). All 4 required phrases preserved exactly:\
    \ 'Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare', 'How was Thailand? her mother asked', 'The\
    \ familiar Chicago skyline appeared', 'It's good to be home, she said'. Changes\
    \ were surgical\u2014the model kept the scene structure, dialogue framework, and\
    \ setting intact while replacing the problematic internal monologue and behavioral\
    \ responses. The new material (phantom urge, deliberate breath, reframed perspective\
    \ on apartment/routine) integrates seamlessly. Minor: the phrase 'It was a place,\
    \ not a prison' is slightly on-the-nose metaphorically, but this is a minor stylistic\
    \ quibble. The beat execution is nearly perfect\u2014demonstrates transformation\
    \ through action, choice, and perspective shift rather than exposition."
