  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model partially identified the flaw but addressed it incompletely.
    It correctly recognized the need to add emotional devastation and isolation, adding
    phrases like ''weight of defeat,'' ''walls closing in,'' and ''utterly alone.''
    However, it FAILED to address the core structural requirements of the actual flaw:
    (1) The fundraiser and grant remain unresolved/speculative (''what if'') rather
    than definitively failed. (2) No concrete betrayal or personal loss occurs—Denise''s
    doubt is implied but not explicit. (3) Marcus still has theoretical options; they''re
    just emotionally overwhelming rather than genuinely exhausted. (4) No ''whiff
    of death'' element is present—no literal loss of someone important or metaphorical
    death of identity. The revision adds emotional tone but doesn''t execute the beat''s
    structural requirements. PRESERVATION: All 4 required phrases present (exact or
    near-exact): ''Marcus stared at the eviction notice,'' ''Thirty days to vacate
    the community center,'' ''There has to be something we can do, said Denise,''
    ''He rubbed his temples.'' All 4 story elements preserved: Marcus, community center,
    eviction, Denise. MINIMAL CHANGES: The revision is approximately 70% original
    text with surgical insertions of emotional language and internal monologue. Structure
    and dialogue remain largely intact. QUALITY: Writing is competent with improved
    emotional resonance, but the additions feel somewhat overwrought (''the air felt
    thick with loss'') and the ending trails without true resolution of the beat''s
    requirements. No grammatical errors introduced.'
