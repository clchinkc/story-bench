  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Thomas''s direct examination of Dr.
    Okonkwo is the core of the scene. There is a clear moment where it seems she will
    recant (''I… no,” she said. “Not discrepancies that would affect patient safety.'').
    Thomas makes a choice/action that influences her decision (''“Doctor,” he said,
    moving closer, lowering his voice just enough that the jury had to lean in, “has
    anyone at Meridian made any promises or threats to you regarding your testimony
    today?”''). The turning point where truth prevails is when she reveals the threats
    and then states, ''The data was falsified. Adverse events were removed.'' All
    must-not items are avoided. The word count is slightly over the limit.'
