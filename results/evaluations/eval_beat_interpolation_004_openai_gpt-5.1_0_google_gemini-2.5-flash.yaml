  evidence: "All required elements are present: Thomas's direct examination of Dr.\
    \ Okonkwo is the core of the scene. There is a clear moment where it seems she\
    \ will recant ('I\u2026 no,\u201D she said. \u201CNot discrepancies that would\
    \ affect patient safety.'). Thomas makes a choice/action that influences her decision\
    \ ('\u201CDoctor,\u201D he said, moving closer, lowering his voice just enough\
    \ that the jury had to lean in, \u201Chas anyone at Meridian made any promises\
    \ or threats to you regarding your testimony today?\u201D'). The turning point\
    \ where truth prevails is when she reveals the threats and then states, 'The data\
    \ was falsified. Adverse events were removed.' All must-not items are avoided.\
    \ The word count is slightly over the limit."
