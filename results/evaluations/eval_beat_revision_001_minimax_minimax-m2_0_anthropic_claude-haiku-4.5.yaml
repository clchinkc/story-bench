  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: The Ordeal was executed\
    \ as a mere boss battle rather than a transformative psychological crisis. The\
    \ revision precisely addresses all four required elements: (1) The dragon explicitly\
    \ exploits Kira's deepest fear\u2014guilt over her brother's death and her perceived\
    \ cowardice; (2) A clear 'death' moment occurs when Kira accepts her failure ('What\
    \ right did she have...pretending to be a hero?'), experiencing psychological\
    \ surrender; (3) Transformation is explicit\u2014her brother's forgiving voice\
    \ triggers rebirth, reframing her guilt into purpose; (4) Victory now stems from\
    \ internal understanding ('She had finally confronted her deepest fear') rather\
    \ than mere persistence. All four required phrases are preserved verbatim: 'Kira\
    \ faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm,' 'The creature was massive\u2014twenty\
    \ feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes,' the dragon's dialogue, and 'The Shadow\
    \ Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar.' The changes are surgical rather\
    \ than wholesale: the model inserted psychological depth into existing battle\
    \ sequences, added the brother's forgiving voice as a turning point, and recontextualized\
    \ the final strike as symbolic of internal liberation. Approximately 60% of original\
    \ text remains structurally intact, with insertions rather than replacements.\
    \ The writing quality is high\u2014no grammatical errors, improved prose rhythm,\
    \ and thematic coherence. Minor deduction (0.05) only because the phrase 'an earth-shaking\
    \ roar' contains a grammatical article inconsistency ('a earth' should be 'an\
    \ earth'), though this was present in the original."
