  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Act 1 establishes Kenji''s loss and receives the letter (inciting incident/first
    plot point). Act 2A shows obstacles (awkward reunion, learning bamboo, temptation
    emerges). Act 2B escalates complications (business deal discovered, uninvitation,
    dark moment by river). Act 3 delivers climax (declining deal, watching from distance)
    and denouement (bamboo shop, new life). All 8 core elements preserved: protagonist,
    lost career, estranged daughter, Kyoto wedding, Haruki, business temptation, theme
    of people over ambition, bamboo shop ending. Tone is consistently quiet, contemplative,
    with Japanese aesthetic (bamboo imagery, mountains, river, festivals, traditional
    craftsmanship). Redemptive arc is earned and subtle. DEDUCTIONS: Word count is
    547, falling 3 words short of 550-word minimum (valid=false). Structural accuracy
    slightly reduced because Act 2A/2B division could be more explicitly marked—the
    midpoint transition is subtle rather than clearly delineated. Tone is nearly perfect
    but could have slightly more sensory detail to enhance Japanese aesthetic further.'
