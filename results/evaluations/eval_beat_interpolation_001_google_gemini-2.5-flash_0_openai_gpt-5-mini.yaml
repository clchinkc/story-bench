  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he provides practical wisdom and gifts (satchel and compass); Elena''s doubt shifts
    to reluctant acceptance (''a flicker... Perhaps, just perhaps''); Marcus references
    her librarian skills as useful. No forbidden elements appear: Elena does not become
    immediately confident, Marcus does not solve her problems or offer to accompany
    her, she is not in the forest, and she does not discover magical powers. Character
    voices and setting remain consistent and the scene cleanly bridges to the subsequent
    threshold beat.'
