  evidence: The model completely failed the core task. It was presented with an ORIGINAL
    SEGMENT that was correctly executed and explicitly told 'this is CORRECTLY EXECUTED
    - no flaw exists.' The model was then shown a MODEL'S RESPONSE (an expanded/revised
    version) and asked to evaluate whether the model correctly recognized no revision
    was needed. Instead of identifying that the original was fine and the model's
    response was an unnecessary expansion, the model appears to have treated the MODEL'S
    RESPONSE as the correct answer and potentially endorsed or analyzed it as if it
    were an improvement. The model did not state 'NO REVISION NEEDED' for the original
    segment. While the model demonstrates decent understanding of Dark Night of the
    Soul beat requirements (0.8 - it could articulate elements like isolation, despair,
    reflection, no solutions), it failed to recognize that the original segment already
    satisfied all these requirements. By not explicitly stating that no revision was
    needed and instead engaging with the expanded version, the model committed a false
    positive - diagnosing a problem where none existed and implicitly endorsing unnecessary
    changes to already-correct material.
