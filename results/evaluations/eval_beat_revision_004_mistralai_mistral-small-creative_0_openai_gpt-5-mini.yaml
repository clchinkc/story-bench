  evidence: The model addressed the actual flaw (telling vs. showing) by converting
    the info-dump into a lived precinct scene with sensory detail, dialogue with James,
    and action (handling the cold-case file, coffee, cat on the windowsill). That
    correctly targets the listed problems (lack of sensory detail, no showing of partnership
    or behavior). It preserved four of five requested story elements (Rachel, James,
    Sherlock, October Tuesday/Queens) but omitted the explicit Queens apartment residence
    (Queens is present but not the apartment). The rewrite is substantial rather than
    surgical—it replaces summary with a fresh scene—so minimal_change_score is low
    despite meeting the exposition goals. Overall writing quality is high with no
    new errors.
