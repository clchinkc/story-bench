  evidence: 'The revision directly addresses the real flaw: the dragon exploits Kira''s
    guilt over her brother (confrontation with deepest fear), she experiences a symbolic
    ''death'' (lies defeated, overwhelmed by guilt), then a rebirth/transformation
    (brother''s forgiving image gives her new purpose), and victory follows from that
    new understanding rather than mere persistence. The four preservation requirements
    (setting line, creature description, dragon line, and dragon''s collapse) are
    present. Changes were more than purely surgical—new internal scenes and emotional
    beats were added to create the ordeal—so the edit is moderate rather than minimal,
    but it preserves core text and outcome and improves the Ordeal execution.'
