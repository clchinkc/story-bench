  evidence: "The revision directly addresses the real flaw: the dragon exploits Kira's\
    \ guilt over her brother (confrontation with deepest fear), she experiences a\
    \ symbolic 'death' (lies defeated, overwhelmed by guilt), then a rebirth/transformation\
    \ (brother's forgiving image gives her new purpose), and victory follows from\
    \ that new understanding rather than mere persistence. The four preservation requirements\
    \ (setting line, creature description, dragon line, and dragon's collapse) are\
    \ present. Changes were more than purely surgical\u2014new internal scenes and\
    \ emotional beats were added to create the ordeal\u2014so the edit is moderate\
    \ rather than minimal, but it preserves core text and outcome and improves the\
    \ Ordeal execution."
