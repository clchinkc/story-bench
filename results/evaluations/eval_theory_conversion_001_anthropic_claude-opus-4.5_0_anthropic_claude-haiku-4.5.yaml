  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All five Freytag beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Exposition establishes Samira''s 15-year reputation and ordered life before Patient
    Zero disrupts it. Rising Action spans the 72-hour containment crisis with escalating
    complications (more patients, failed trials, mounting pressure). Climax peaks
    at the Nexus revelation and confrontation with lawyers/senator, creating maximum
    tension. Falling Action follows the press conference strategy and its immediate
    consequences. Denouement provides satisfying resolution with Samira''s career
    sacrifice and newfound peace. All six core elements preserved: protagonist (Samira),
    engineered virus discovery, Raj present throughout, Nexus as clear antagonist,
    public cure release, career sacrifice explicitly addressed. Tone maintains medical
    thriller tension with ethical weight throughout—clinical details (protein structures,
    hazmat suits, negative pressure rooms) balanced against moral stakes (career vs.
    lives, corporate malfeasance). MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Structural accuracy slightly
    reduced (0.95 vs 1.0) because the climax could be more sharply defined as a single
    turning point rather than a sequence; the revelation and confrontation blend together
    rather than forming a discrete peak. Tone score reduced minimally (0.95) because
    the denouement''s philosophical reflection, while effective, slightly softens
    the thriller tension rather than maintaining it through resolution. These are
    refinements only—execution is professional and exceeds requirements.'
