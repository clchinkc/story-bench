  - 'VIOLATION: Contact with Earth family - Yuna''s encrypted message about arrested
    parents directly violates ''MUST NOT INCLUDE: Contact with Earth family''. This
    is a significant constraint breach that undermines the exile premise.'
  analysis:
    beats_analysis: 'All three required beats are present and well-executed: SEARCH
      (Jin navigating the Collective''s corridors, learning protocols, immersing himself
      in research); FIND (discovery of terraforming applications in Lab Seven, the
      unexpected expansion of the technology); TAKE (Jin transmitting the data package,
      gaining parents'' freedom but compromising Collective principles and arming
      authoritarian regimes).'
    must_include_analysis: 'All 6 elements successfully integrated: (1) Jin navigating
      Collective culture/politics through Kala''s guidance and his own discovery of
      the no-patent ethos; (2) Kala as mentor figure explaining systems and moral
      complexities; (3) Unexpected discovery of terraforming/atmospheric engineering
      applications; (4) Jin finding safety and platform for continued research; (5)
      Transmission action with clear consequences; (6) Moral compromise crystallized
      in the choice between family freedom and Collective principles.'
    must_not_analysis: 'Successfully avoided 3 of 4 constraints: (1) No easy integration—Jin
      struggles with unfamiliar customs, feels lost initially, takes weeks to find
      footing; (2) No violence or weapons depicted; (3) Conspiracy plot remains unresolved
      (Council''s motivations, larger political dynamics continue). HOWEVER: Contact
      with Earth family is violated through Yuna''s message and the parents'' arrest
      leverage.'
    tone_analysis: Contemplative and politically charged tone maintained throughout.
      Personal stakes (family, exile, moral identity) are interwoven with larger systemic
      conflicts (climate crisis, authoritarian control, technology weaponization).
      The ending particularly achieves the required introspective, morally ambiguous
      tone with 'some victories carried the seeds of future defeats.'
    ending_analysis: Ends precisely at the Take beat with Jin having gained family
      freedom and Earth receiving climate technology, but having paid the price of
      compromising Collective principles and potentially arming hostile regimes. The
      final image of Jin staring at Earth with Kala's cryptic wisdom captures the
      weight of consequence. Slightly less than perfect because the ending could more
      explicitly emphasize Jin's internal transformation or the specific cost he'll
      bear.
    overall_assessment: Strong execution with one critical constraint violation. The
      story demonstrates sophisticated understanding of Story Circle structure and
      maintains excellent thematic coherence. The constraint violation (Earth family
      contact) is significant enough to prevent a perfect score, but the violation
      itself serves the narrative—it's the catalyst for the Take beat. This creates
      tension between technical compliance and narrative necessity.
