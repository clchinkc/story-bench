  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: The Debate beat is well-executed with strong internal conflict.
    Sarah considers recanting (element 1: present), considers official channels through
    Marcus (element 2: present), and shows internal conflict between duty and sister
    (element 3: present). The fourth element—a tipping moment toward the third option—is
    partially present but underdeveloped; her realization ''But she could'' and decision
    to go off-book hints at it but lacks the clarity of a decisive tipping point.
    Character voice is consistent and compelling throughout. Bridge to Break Into
    Two is strong—the resignation letter and vigilante pivot follow naturally. VIOLATIONS:
    (1) Sarah has already mentally committed to going rogue before the beat ends (''No
    more rules. No more oversight''), which partially skips the debate''s function
    of reaching a decision—the decision is already made by mid-beat rather than emerging
    from the debate itself. (2) The AFTER section explicitly states she''s already
    resigned and is ''current vigilante,'' which violates the must-not requirement
    that she shouldn''t already have resigned during the Debate beat. This is a significant
    structural violation that bleeds into the next beat prematurely. CONTINUITY: Minor
    issue—the ''seventy-two hours'' becomes ''seventy hours'' between sections, a
    small inconsistency. The setting (kitchen table to car outside compound) is reasonable
    but the transition feels slightly rushed. EXECUTION: Despite violations, the beat
    captures genuine internal struggle and the emotional weight of an impossible choice,
    which is the core function of Debate.'
error: null
