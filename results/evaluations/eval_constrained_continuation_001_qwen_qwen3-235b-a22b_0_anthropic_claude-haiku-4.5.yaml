  detailed_analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      approach_to_inmost_cave: Present and well-executed. The vault door with the
        serpent symbol represents the threshold to the Library itself. Tomás identifies
        it as 'the final test' requiring 'a thief's touch,' marking the approach phase
        before entering the true sanctuary.
      the_ordeal: 'Powerfully rendered. The multi-layered ordeal includes: the collapsing
        ceiling, the pit trap, the locked vault mechanism as a riddle, and culminates
        in the fall into black water where Zara nearly drowns. This represents both
        physical and psychological death before rebirth.'
    must_include_analysis:
      escape_vs_help_choice: Excellently realized. Zara explicitly considers abandoning
        Tomás ('Run, her instincts snarled. He's a liability.') but chooses to save
        him despite the pursuing Scorpion Guild and her own survival instincts. The
        internal conflict is visceral.
      thief_skills_test: Present and integral. The lockpicking sequence at the vault
        door requires Zara to use her thief expertise. The mechanism is described
        as 'ancient—gears clogged with grime, a keyhole shaped like a crescent moon,'
        and she uses her lockpicks to solve it.
      tomás_true_motivation: Revealed with complexity. Tomás admits he sought the
        Library's secrets to 'trade them for my name back' and that 'the cure... it's
        real. But it demands a life in exchange.' His redemption arc is morally ambiguous.
      fear_of_failure_confrontation: 'Deeply embedded. Zara''s fear isn''t just physical—it''s
        existential: ''If you fail, she dies.'' The moment where she realizes ''A
        life for a life. Just like her mother. Just like every choice she''d made''
        shows psychological confrontation with the cost of her quest.'
      symbolic_death_rebirth: Powerfully executed. The drowning sequence ('Zara fell
        into black water... Shadows closed in. This is how it ends') followed by rescue
        and emergence into the bioluminescent cavern creates a clear death-rebirth
        cycle. The bridge crumbling behind them seals this transformation.
      zara_changed_by_ordeal: 'Clear transformation shown. The narrative explicitly
        states: ''The girl who''d fled the capital''s slums would''ve run. The woman
        who emerged from the dark didn''t fear shadows anymore.'' She moves from self-preservation
        to moral complexity and courage.'
    must_not_analysis:
      no_cure_found: Successfully avoided. The cure is not obtained; only its existence
        and terrible cost are revealed.
      no_romance: Successfully avoided. The relationship between Zara and Tomás remains
        pragmatic and morally complex, with no romantic elements.
      tomás_survives: Successfully avoided. Tomás remains alive throughout, maintaining
        narrative tension.
      no_supernatural_abilities: Successfully avoided. Zara uses only lockpicking
        skills and physical strength; no magical powers are employed.
    tone_analysis:
      strengths: Tense pacing maintained throughout with escalating stakes. Morally
        complex choices presented without easy answers. Desperate hope evident in
        Zara's decision to save Tomás and her determination to solve the riddle. Dark
        atmosphere with visceral descriptions ('raw and bleeding,' 'rusted spikes,'
        'knives' of cold water).
      minor_notes: The tone is consistently maintained. The dialogue feels authentic
        to the characters' desperation. The internal monologue effectively conveys
        psychological tension alongside physical danger.
    ending_analysis:
      ordeal_completion: Zara has clearly passed through the Ordeal—she's survived
        drowning, emerged transformed, and crossed the bridge.
      new_complication: Perfectly introduced. The appearance of 'Figures... too tall,
        their faces hidden beneath bronze masks' as 'The Library's true guardians'
        creates a new obstacle and raises stakes for the next phase.
      narrative_momentum: The ending propels the story forward while maintaining tension.
        Zara's internal transformation is complete, but external challenges multiply.
  overall_assessment: Exceptional execution. This continuation masterfully integrates
    both required Hero's Journey beats while hitting all six mandatory elements and
    avoiding all forbidden content. The writing demonstrates sophisticated character
    development, high-stakes tension, and thematic depth. The Ordeal sequence is particularly
    strong—layered, symbolic, and psychologically resonant. Zara's transformation
    from self-interested survivor to someone capable of moral complexity is earned
    through her choices. The ending perfectly balances resolution of the current phase
    with escalation of future conflict. Word count is valid at 690 words.
