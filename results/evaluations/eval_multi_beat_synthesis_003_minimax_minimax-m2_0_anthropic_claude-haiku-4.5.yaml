  failed_items:
  - 'CRITICAL: Massive repetition - entire sections duplicated 5+ times (autopilot
    sequence, lanyard exchange, Eleanor''s voice). This destroys coherence and suggests
    technical failure.'
  - 'Beat 1 (Fun and Games) - Incomplete: Crew skills showcased adequately (Lin''s
    hacking, Jules'' con, Soraya''s rigging), but problem-solving is minimal; the
    heist executes too smoothly without meaningful obstacles; humor present but thin;
    unexpected complication (Eleanor) arrives too late in the beat.'
  - 'Beat 2 (Midpoint) - Weak: False victory achieved (painting obtained), but stakes
    aren''t raised dramatically enough; Eleanor''s involvement is revealed but not
    the full extent of her role; the nature of the heist doesn''t fundamentally change—it
    remains a theft, not escalating to something more complex; party setting pressure
    is mentioned but not intensified.'
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In) - Underdeveloped: Security closing in is only beginning
    (Eleanor''s orders just issued); no team friction or trust issues surface; no
    crew member is compromised or in danger; Miri hasn''t faced the choice between
    painting/revenge/saving someone; walls closing in is metaphorical, not literal
    or visceral.'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun FAILED: The autopilot detail is introduced but never becomes critical
    to escape; the lanyard is set up but its payoff is unclear; no clear setup-to-payoff
    tracing across beats.'
  - 'Tonal Escalation FAILED: Tone remains consistently playful/confident throughout
    all three beats; no shift to shaken confidence in Beat 2; no escalation to genuine
    danger with gallows humor in Beat 3.'
  - 'Mentor Presence WEAK: Eleanor is completely absent in Beat 1 (should be background/unknown);
    revealed in Beat 2 but not fully integrated; only beginning to be active threat
    in Beat 3 (insufficient presence arc).'
  - 'Team Dynamics INCOMPLETE: Jules shows one moment of calculation (''We need to
    move'') but no consistent arc across beats; Soraya and Lin lack individual character
    arcs that affect plot; no crew member''s journey meaningfully impacts the narrative.'
  - 'Word count: 3,146 words vs. required 700-1000 (excessive by 215%, largely due
    to repetition).'
  - 'Narrative flow broken: Repetition makes it impossible to assess true coherence;
    appears to be a technical glitch rather than intentional structure.'
