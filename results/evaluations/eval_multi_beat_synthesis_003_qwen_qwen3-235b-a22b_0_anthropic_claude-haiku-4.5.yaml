  failed_items:
  - Beat 1 - 'Things going according to plan (mostly)' is undercut; the complication
    arrives too early and dominates, shifting tone before Midpoint
  - Beat 1 - Insufficient showcase of crew skills beyond Nikolai's lock-picking; Anya's
    hacking and Luca's role remain underdeveloped
  - 'Cross-beat constraint - Chekhov''s Gun partially weak: ventilation grate is mentioned
    but feels introduced reactively rather than established during Fun and Games setup'
  - 'Cross-beat constraint - Tonal Escalation incomplete: Beat 1 lacks sustained playful
    confidence; Eleanor''s reveal collapses the tone too quickly, compressing Midpoint
    into Fun and Games'
  detailed_analysis:
    beat_1_fun_and_games:
      score: 0.75
      strengths:
      - Excellent heist action with tactical choreography (camera loop, fireworks
        distraction, lock-picking)
      - Strong humor and style (dry quips, 'Oh, I already do')
      - Crew skills partially showcased (Nikolai's sleight-of-hand, Anya's hacking)
      - Minor complication introduced (guard noticing the fake)
      weaknesses:
      - Complication escalates too dramatically too soon; Eleanor's reveal should
        be Midpoint, not Beat 1 climax
      - Luca introduced but not meaningfully deployed; his trembling comes later without
        prior establishment
      - Insufficient 'things going according to plan' momentum; the heist feels immediately
        compromised
    beat_2_midpoint:
      score: 0.85
      strengths:
      - 'False victory clearly achieved: Raphael secured and moving to dinghy'
      - 'Stakes raised dramatically: Eleanor revealed as security consultant'
      - Mentor involvement confirmed with high impact
      - Nature of heist shifts from theft to survival/revenge
      - Party setting intensifies pressure (intercoms, sealed exits, guards)
      weaknesses:
      - Midpoint feels rushed; Eleanor's presence should linger longer before full
        threat activation
      - The 'false victory' is immediately negated; no breathing room for audience
        to feel the win
    beat_3_bad_guys_close_in:
      score: 0.8
      strengths:
      - Security actively closing in (intercoms, sealed doors, three-minute sweep)
      - Team friction surfaces (Anya sprinting, Nikolai's silent nod, Luca's fear)
      - 'Crew member compromised: Luca held at gunpoint'
      - 'Miri''s choice crystallizes: painting vs. revenge vs. crew'
      - Literal and figurative walls closing in (sealed exits, converging lights)
      weaknesses:
      - Crew member danger (Luca) introduced late without prior establishment; feels
        convenient rather than earned
    cross_beat_constraints:
      chekhov_gun:
        score: 0.6
        analysis: Ventilation grate and maintenance layout are mentioned but feel
          reactive. Nikolai's earlier note ('he'd noted the ventilation layout while
          planting the replica') attempts retroactive setup but lacks the deliberate
          foreshadowing needed. The fireworks distraction works better as payoff but
          was established in Beat 1 opening, not as a planted detail.
      tonal_escalation:
        score: 0.7
        analysis: Beat 1 should sustain playful confidence longer; Eleanor's reveal
          collapses it prematurely. Beat 2 does raise stakes and shake confidence.
          Beat 3 achieves genuine danger and gallows humor ('She's got a mentor to
          kill'). Overall arc present but compressed.
      mentor_presence:
        score: 0.9
        analysis: 'Excellent escalation: Beat 1 (silhouette, unknown), Beat 2 (Eleanor
          Voss revealed, voice over comms), Beat 3 (active physical threat at helm).
          This constraint is nearly perfectly executed.'
      team_dynamics:
        score: 0.8
        analysis: 'Nikolai has consistent arc: confident magician → silent supporter
          → willing sacrifice. Anya transitions from hacker to runner. Luca''s arc
          is underdeveloped (introduced trembling, then held hostage). Nikolai''s
          arc most clearly affects plot (his distraction enables escape).'
    context_adherence:
      protagonist: 0.9
      setting: 0.85
      tone: 0.8
      analysis: Miri's characterization strong (dry wit, meticulous, conflicted between
        justice and revenge). Monaco/yacht setting vivid. Ocean's Eleven tone mostly
        achieved but tension occasionally overwhelms cleverness. The 'art history'
        element present but could be deeper.
    coherence:
      score: 0.8
      strengths:
      - Clear narrative progression through three beats
      - Eleanor's presence creates through-line
      - Crew dynamics provide emotional stakes
      - Ending (partial victory, crew saved, painting escapes) resolves tension
      weaknesses:
      - Pacing compresses Midpoint; Eleanor's reveal feels simultaneous with complication
        rather than escalation
      - Luca's character arc feels grafted on; his introduction and peril lack earned
        weight
      - Final resolution ('Some victories were measured in degrees') is thematically
        sound but narratively abrupt
  overall_assessment: The story executes a solid heist narrative with strong mentor
    antagonism and crew dynamics. Beat 2 and 3 are particularly well-crafted. However,
    Beat 1 lacks sufficient 'things going according to plan' momentum, and the tonal
    escalation is compressed rather than graduated. The Chekhov's Gun constraint is
    partially satisfied but feels reactive. Word count (565) falls significantly short
    of the 700-1000 range, limiting character development and foreshadowing opportunities.
    With expansion and restructuring to give Beat 1 more breathing room before Eleanor's
    reveal, this would reach 0.9+ territory.
