  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Act 1 establishes Kenji''s corporate loss and Yuki''s wedding invitation (Setup
    + Inciting Incident + First Plot Point). Act 2A develops obstacles through village
    arrival, awkward family dynamics, and Haruki''s mentorship (Rising Action with
    Midpoint shift). Act 2B escalates with the Tokyo business call, Yuki''s confrontation,
    and Kenji''s refusal (Complications + Second Plot Point). Act 3 delivers climax
    at the shrine and denouement with the bamboo shop. All 8 core elements preserved:
    protagonist Kenji, lost career, estranged Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki craftsman,
    business temptation, theme of people over ambition, bamboo shop ending. Tone is
    consistently quiet, contemplative, with strong Japanese aesthetic (bamboo imagery,
    bowing, yukata, shrine, lanterns, noren curtain). Redemptive arc is earned and
    subtle. CRITICAL WEAKNESS: Word count is 1268, exceeding the 550-750 range by
    518 words (169% over). This is a significant structural violation that cannot
    be overlooked despite excellent content quality. The conversion prioritized narrative
    depth over constraint adherence. Structural accuracy is high (0.9) because beats
    are clear, but the excessive length suggests the conversion expanded rather than
    distilled the Save the Cat framework into three-act form.'
