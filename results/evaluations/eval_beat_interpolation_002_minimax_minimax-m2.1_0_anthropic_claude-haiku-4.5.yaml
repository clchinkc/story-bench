  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: Present are (1) recanting testimony as easy wrong choice,
    (2) considering official channels/Morrison/IA, (3) strong internal conflict between
    duty and sister. Missing element: No clear moment/conversation that tips her toward
    the third option—the decision to go rogue emerges internally without a catalyst
    within the beat itself. VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah already decides to resign and go
    rogue during this beat (''I need you to trust me...time to start saying goodbye''),
    which should occur at Break Into Two, not during Debate. This compresses two beats
    into one. (2) The AFTER section explicitly shows her resignation already completed,
    confirming the decision was made during this beat rather than being the threshold
    moment. EXECUTION: The beat captures internal wrestling well but fails the narrative
    function by resolving the debate too conclusively—she should end uncertain or
    on the cusp, not committed to vigilantism. CHARACTER: Sarah''s voice remains consistent
    and credible throughout. BRIDGE: Good connection between BEFORE (catalyst/threat)
    and GENERATED (debate options), though the AFTER section violates beat boundaries.
    CONTINUITY: Setting and timeline maintained coherently (71-hour countdown, apartment/kitchen,
    Marcus conversation).'
