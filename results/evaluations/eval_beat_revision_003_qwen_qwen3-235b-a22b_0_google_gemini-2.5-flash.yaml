  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original flaw was Sophie's lack
    of change upon returning. The revision directly addresses this by showing Sophie
    making a conscious choice to prioritize her well-being over immediate work demands,
    a direct contrast to her previous behavior. It integrates a specific lesson from
    the retreat ('how loud my head used to be,' 'Now I can hear myself think') and
    shows a behavioral marker of change (placing the phone face-down). Her mother's
    observation ('Can't it wait until morning?' and gesturing at the phone) implicitly
    highlights the change. The changes were surgical and focused on the flaw, preserving
    much of the original structure and dialogue.
