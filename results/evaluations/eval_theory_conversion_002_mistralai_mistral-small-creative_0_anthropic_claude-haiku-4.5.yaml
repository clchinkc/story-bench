  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present (1) Ordinary World - opening pottery scene; (2)
    Call to Adventure - dried spring; (3) Refusal of Call - implicit hesitation (''words
    tasted like ash''); (4) Meeting the Mentor - grandmother''s journal discovery;
    (5) Crossing Threshold - beginning mountain journey; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies
    - journey hardships, near-turning back; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave - finding
    shrine; (8) Ordeal - creating the vessel through surrender; (9) Reward - vessel
    completion at dawn; (10) Road Back - descent with vessel. MISSING: (11) Resurrection
    - no explicit life-or-death moment or final test upon return; (12) Return with
    Elixir - water returns but lacks explicit integration of wisdom into community/new
    role. PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact—Maya (protagonist), pottery (central),
    grandmother''s legacy (journal), mountain shrine (journey), dried spring (problem),
    surrender theme (core transformation), Maya''s transformation (demonstrated).
    STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Strong adherence to monomyth structure through Reward stage;
    weakens in final two beats which feel compressed into single resolution. The narrative
    prioritizes emotional arc over complete mythic scaffolding. TONE: Excellent maintenance
    of quiet, meditative voice throughout—sparse dialogue, sensory detail, internal
    reflection. Transformative arc clear and earned. DEDUCTION: Word count 4 words
    short of minimum (596 vs 600); missing explicit Resurrection beat; Return with
    Elixir underdeveloped relative to Campbell''s emphasis on community transformation.'
