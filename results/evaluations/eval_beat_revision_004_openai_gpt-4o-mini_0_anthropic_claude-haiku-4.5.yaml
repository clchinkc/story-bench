  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw\u2014excessive\
    \ telling through info-dump rather than showing through scene and action. The\
    \ revision demonstrates strong understanding by: (1) grounding Rachel in a specific\
    \ moment (apartment window with coffee), (2) revealing her detective instincts\
    \ through behavior (scanning the street, mind racing through cases), (3) showing\
    \ her relationship with James through dialogue and interaction rather than summary,\
    \ (4) incorporating sensory details (coffee aroma, morning light, cat's green\
    \ eyes), (5) naturally weaving in the cat and her devotion to cold cases through\
    \ action. FLAW CORRECTION: The revision successfully converts telling to showing\
    \ in ~85% of cases. Minor weakness: some residual telling remains ('She admired\
    \ James's knack...three years together forged a bond') that could have been shown\
    \ more purely through dialogue/action. BEAT SATISFACTION: Exposition is well-executed\u2014\
    establishes setting, protagonist through behavior, relationships through interaction,\
    \ and creates investment in Rachel's character and her obsession with cases. The\
    \ final line ('It was a Tuesday morning in October when everything changed') effectively\
    \ signals the inciting incident is imminent. PRESERVATION: All 5 elements preserved\
    \ perfectly: Detective Rachel Torres (protagonist), Detective James Oyelaran (partner),\
    \ cat named Sherlock, Queens apartment, October Tuesday timing. All 4 required\
    \ phrases present verbatim or near-exact. MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is a\
    \ MODERATE-TO-SUBSTANTIAL rewrite (0.4 score), not minimal surgical edits. The\
    \ original structure was largely abandoned\u2014the info-dump paragraphs were\
    \ replaced with a scene-based narrative. While this was the correct fix, it violates\
    \ the 'minimal modification' constraint. A more surgical approach would have kept\
    \ more of the original phrasing while converting it to scene. QUALITY: Writing\
    \ is professional, no new errors introduced, prose flows naturally with good sensory\
    \ detail and pacing."
