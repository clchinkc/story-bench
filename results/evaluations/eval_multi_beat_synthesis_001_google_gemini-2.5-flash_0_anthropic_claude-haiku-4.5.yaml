  failed_items:
  - Word count exceeds maximum (1083 vs 1000 limit) - minor technical violation
  detailed_analysis:
    beat_1_tests_allies_enemies:
      requirement_1_distrusting_resonant: SATISFIED - Lena introduced with suspicion
        ('You see what you want to see, Reyes'), gradually shifts to respect
      requirement_2_ability_test_under_pressure: SATISFIED - Dante must identify the
        killer's signature void and distinguish it from normal emotional residue;
        tested by Lena to prove his sight
      requirement_3_enemy_within_community: SATISFIED - Revelation of accomplice/traitor
        ('someone else laid that emotion here'); killer has insider knowledge
      requirement_4_prove_himself_for_ally: SATISFIED - Dante demonstrates unique
        insight about misdirection and void signature; earns Lena's 'grudging respect'
      requirement_5_addiction_recovery_relevance: SATISFIED - Lena's barb about sobriety
        ('soaked in...other things'); Dante's three-year clean status contextualizes
        his emotional sensitivity
      score: 1.0
    beat_2_approach_inmost_cave:
      requirement_1_plan_confrontation: SATISFIED - Detailed planning scene in workshop
        with map, strategy discussion about killer's methods
      requirement_2_guilt_as_obstacle: SATISFIED - Dante explicitly recognizes confrontation
        means 'plumbing the depths of that old wound' regarding Sofia; guilt identified
        as psychological threat
      requirement_3_preparation_scene: SATISFIED - Gathering of Rosa's obsidian shard
        (tool); map study; emotional preparation; descent into sub-basements
      requirement_4_doubt_or_fear: 'SATISFIED - Internal questioning: ''Could he stand
        against a force that inflicted that same desolation on others?''; vulnerability
        shown'
      requirement_5_symbolic_threshold: SATISFIED - Descent into 'Buckingham's true
        heart – the forgotten sub-basements' represents crossing into danger; physical
        and psychological threshold
      score: 1.0
    beat_3_the_ordeal:
      requirement_1_direct_confrontation: SATISFIED - Killer emerges, confrontation
        begins; killer uses psychological attack targeting Dante's guilt
      requirement_2_symbolic_death: SATISFIED - Dante paralyzed by guilt, 'drowning
        in guilt,' vision narrows to Sofia's death, 'all seemed lost'—psychological
        death/overwhelm
      requirement_3_all_seems_lost: SATISFIED - Killer's void spreads through Dante;
        Lena attacked; Dante 'paralyzed, lost in the echo of his past failure'
      requirement_4_transformation_through_acceptance: SATISFIED - Dante accepts guilt
        as real but not defining; recognizes void as reflection; integrates understanding
        of shared emptiness; 'acceptance of loss'
      requirement_5_victory_through_understanding: SATISFIED - Victory achieved through
        'profound understanding of their shared...emptiness,' not physical strength;
        killer falters when Dante projects 'hard-won sobriety'
      score: 1.0
    cross_beat_chekhov_gun:
      status: SATISFIED
      analysis: Rosa's obsidian shard introduced in Beat 2 as tool to 'amplify focus'
        and 'cut through noise.' In Beat 3, it becomes essential—vibrates in Dante's
        hand at the critical moment, enabling his breakthrough. The shard is both
        literal tool and symbolic anchor to Rosa's memory/strength.
      score: 1.0
    cross_beat_character_arc:
      beat_1: Guilt mentioned—Lena references addiction history; Dante carries unresolved
        trauma about Sofia
      beat_2: Guilt recognized as obstacle—Dante explicitly identifies that confrontation
        requires 'plumbing the depths of that old wound'; guilt becomes psychological
        threat
      beat_3: Guilt transformed—Dante accepts guilt as real but not defining; uses
        it as 'window into killer's emptiness'; transforms pain into understanding
        and strength
      status: SATISFIED
      score: 1.0
    cross_beat_rising_stakes:
      beat_1: Personal stakes—proving himself to an ally; establishing killer exists
      beat_2: Emotional stakes—recognizing confrontation will trigger deepest trauma;
        preparing for psychological battle
      beat_3: Existential stakes—direct confrontation; Dante nearly consumed by killer's
        power; Lena attacked; Dante's identity/sobriety threatened
      status: SATISFIED
      score: 1.0
    cross_beat_ally_continuity:
      beat_1: Lena introduced, distrusts Dante, gradually becomes ally
      beat_2: Lena present in planning, shares Rosa's shard, descends with Dante
      beat_3: Lena present during confrontation, attacked by killer, her presence
        validates Dante's commitment
      status: SATISFIED
      score: 1.0
    context_maintenance:
      protagonist_dante: STRONG - Dante's voice, abilities, recovery, guilt all present
        and consistent
      setting_buckingham: STRONG - Hotel used throughout; sub-basements as climactic
        location; emotional residue system maintained
      tone_noir_melancholic: STRONG - Noir atmosphere in sub-basement; melancholic
        reflection on loss; determined resolve; redemption arc evident
      resonant_world: STRONG - Resonant abilities, community, emotional sensitivity
        system all integrated
      score: 0.95
    coherence:
      beat_flow: Excellent progression from introduction/testing through planning
        to confrontation
      thematic_unity: Guilt and redemption thread consistently through all beats
      pacing: Well-balanced; each beat receives appropriate development
      emotional_arc: Clear trajectory from doubt to acceptance to transformation
      minor_issue: Word count slightly exceeds limit (1083 vs 1000), but narrative
        coherence unaffected
      score: 0.92
  strengths:
  - Exceptional integration of all 15 beat requirements with natural narrative flow
  - Perfect execution of all 4 cross-beat constraints; Chekhov's Gun particularly
    elegant
  - Character arc progression is sophisticated—guilt moves from shame to tool for
    understanding
  - Lena's character development mirrors Dante's arc (distrust to alliance)
  - Noir tone maintained throughout with vivid sensory details
  - 'Thematic coherence: emotional residue system serves both plot and character development'
  - Climactic moment balances action with psychological/emotional transformation
  - Rosa's presence (through shard and memory) creates emotional weight despite her
    death
  weaknesses:
  - Word count exceeds specification by 83 words (1083 vs 1000 max)—technical violation
    only
  - Killer's identity/motivation remains somewhat opaque (though this may be intentional
    for noir style)
  - Could benefit from slightly more sensory detail in Beat 2 preparation scene
  calibration_notes: 'This is a strong submission that satisfies nearly all requirements
    with sophistication. The single technical failure (word count) is minor and doesn''t
    impact narrative quality. The story demonstrates excellent understanding of Campbell''s
    monomyth structure and successfully weaves all constraints into organic narrative.
    The character arc is particularly well-executed, with guilt functioning as both
    obstacle and ultimate source of victory. Scoring: 0.93 overall (between ''Good''
    at 0.8 and ''Exceptional'' at 1.0, leaning toward exceptional due to constraint
    satisfaction and thematic coherence, but held back slightly by word count violation
    and minor characterization gaps).'
