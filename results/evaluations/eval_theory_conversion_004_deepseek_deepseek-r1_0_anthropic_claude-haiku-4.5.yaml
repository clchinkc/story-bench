  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly delineated: (1) You—opening
    sanctuary in library stacks; (2) Need—hollowness and longing for connection; (3)
    Go—Ms. Okafor''s invitation and Zoe''s entry into oral history program; (4) Search—learning
    to interview, breathing through silences, discovering listening as courage; (5)
    Find—Bernard Park breakthrough, his trust, the realization that listening means
    bearing witness; (6) Take—town hall presentation, speaking Bernard''s truth publicly,
    accepting responsibility; (7) Return—summer ends, Zoe back in library with changed
    perspective, continuing visits to Bernard; (8) Change—demonstrated through journalism
    choice, funeral speech about her transformation, quiet certainty about her new
    identity. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral
    history program, Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key relationship),
    social anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic Take beat),
    Bernard''s death (Return/Change catalyst), journalism school ending. Tone is consistently
    gentle, intimate, and emotionally true—introspective without melodrama, tender
    without sentimentality. Minor deduction (0.05) from structural accuracy: the transition
    between Search and Find could be slightly more distinct; Bernard''s condition
    (''she had to share it publicly'') emerges somewhat abruptly rather than as a
    clear threshold moment. Tone deduction (0.05): one phrase (''the 900s'') is slightly
    too casual for the otherwise lyrical register.'
