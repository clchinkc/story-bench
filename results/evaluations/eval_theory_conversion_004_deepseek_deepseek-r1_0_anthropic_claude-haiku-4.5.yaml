  evidence: "All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly delineated: (1) You\u2014\
    opening sanctuary in library stacks; (2) Need\u2014hollowness and longing for\
    \ connection; (3) Go\u2014Ms. Okafor's invitation and Zoe's entry into oral history\
    \ program; (4) Search\u2014learning to interview, breathing through silences,\
    \ discovering listening as courage; (5) Find\u2014Bernard Park breakthrough, his\
    \ trust, the realization that listening means bearing witness; (6) Take\u2014\
    town hall presentation, speaking Bernard's truth publicly, accepting responsibility;\
    \ (7) Return\u2014summer ends, Zoe back in library with changed perspective, continuing\
    \ visits to Bernard; (8) Change\u2014demonstrated through journalism choice, funeral\
    \ speech about her transformation, quiet certainty about her new identity. All\
    \ 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history\
    \ program, Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key relationship), social\
    \ anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic Take beat), Bernard's\
    \ death (Return/Change catalyst), journalism school ending. Tone is consistently\
    \ gentle, intimate, and emotionally true\u2014introspective without melodrama,\
    \ tender without sentimentality. Minor deduction (0.05) from structural accuracy:\
    \ the transition between Search and Find could be slightly more distinct; Bernard's\
    \ condition ('she had to share it publicly') emerges somewhat abruptly rather\
    \ than as a clear threshold moment. Tone deduction (0.05): one phrase ('the 900s')\
    \ is slightly too casual for the otherwise lyrical register."
