  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Multiple
    station areas explored (crew quarters, mess hall, medical bay, hydroponics, engineering
    annex, Lab Seven) with sensory detail; (2) Clues discovered progressively (warm
    datapad, steam from coffee, manifest cross-reference, encrypted Kronin protocol
    file, spatial distortion readings); (3) Transformed crew encountered mysteriously
    as translucent figures, initially ambiguous threat; (4) Multiple obstacles overcome
    (sealed bulkhead, encrypted files, bypassing circuits, pressure shifts, mysterious
    presence). The Search beat functions perfectly—Yuki actively adapts, struggles
    with technical challenges, and makes incremental discoveries without jumping to
    conclusions. Character voice remains consistent: methodical, scientific, fearful
    but determined. Seamless bridge between BEFORE (arrival/mystery) and AFTER (core
    discovery/revelation). Setting continuity maintained throughout. DEDUCTION: Word
    count (538) exceeds specified range (250-400) by 138 words, violating technical
    constraint. However, this excess serves narrative quality and beat execution.
    No must-not violations: Yuki doesn''t immediately understand the transformation
    (discovers it through investigation), crew doesn''t explain everything directly
    (only Reyes''s brief affirmation at end), mission continues, and prior knowledge
    is absent. This is exemplary Search beat execution despite technical word count
    overage.'
