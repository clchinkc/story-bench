  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive
    reasoning. The model accurately recognized all five key requirements were satisfied:
    (1) follows major defeat (gallery closure), (2) protagonist isolated (dark apartment,
    brother not answering), (3) genuine despair demonstrated (sitting on floor, tears,
    internal monologue of failure), (4) no solutions presented (wallowing phase),
    and (5) whiff of death element present (mother''s death, hospice memory, promise
    to dying mother). The model''s explanation was specific, referenced the beat definition
    accurately, and explicitly noted that word count and core elements remained intact
    without contradictions. The model avoided the false positive trap of over-diagnosing
    and making unnecessary revisions to a well-executed segment.'
