  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie immediately
    returning to her old workaholic patterns without showing any change from her meditation
    retreat. It introduced specific actions and internal thoughts that demonstrate
    her transformation, such as deliberately setting her phone down, deciding work
    can wait, powering off her phone, and planning a different morning routine. The
    changes were surgical and minimal, preserving the core structure and dialogue
    while effectively showcasing the 'Return (Having Changed)' beat. All required
    preserved phrases and elements are present.
