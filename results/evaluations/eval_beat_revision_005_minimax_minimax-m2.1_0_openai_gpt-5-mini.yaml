  model_said_no_revision: true
  evidence: 'The model responded ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' and provided a clear explanation
    that the segment meets Dark Night of the Soul criteria: follows All Is Lost (gallery
    closure), shows isolation (dark apartment, unresponsive brother), conveys genuine
    despair and reflection (failed promise, tears), offers no solutions, and includes
    mortality elements (mother''s death, hospice memory). It also noted word-count
    compliance.'
