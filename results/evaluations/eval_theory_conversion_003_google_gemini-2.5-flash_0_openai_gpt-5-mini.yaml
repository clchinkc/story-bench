  evidence: 'All four three-act beats are clearly present: Act 1 (world, inciting
    letter, Kenji leaves for Kyoto as first plot point), Act 2A (village integration,
    learning from Haruki, midpoint ''false victory''), Act 2B (tempting business offer
    and Yuki''s rejection as second plot point), Act 3 (Kenji declines deal, seeks
    reconciliation, opens bamboo shop). All eight required elements are preserved.
    Small deductions: pacing compresses some transitions (midpoint→complication) and
    the climax is quietly understated—appropriate to tone but slightly downplayed
    structurally; tone otherwise remains a quiet, redemptive Japanese aesthetic throughout.'
