  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to show
    Sophie's change upon returning. It addressed this by having Sophie respond differently
    to work stress, articulate a lesson from the retreat, show a behavioral marker
    of change (putting phone away), and have her mother notice the change. The changes
    were surgical and focused on demonstrating the 'Return (Having Changed)' beat
    effectively, without rewriting large portions of the original text.
