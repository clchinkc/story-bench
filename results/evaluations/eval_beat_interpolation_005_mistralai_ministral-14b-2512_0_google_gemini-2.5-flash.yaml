  evidence: The word count is significantly over the requested range. While the story
    is compelling, Alejandro's character takes a very sudden and intense turn with
    the blood-licking, which feels a bit out of sync with his 'notorious recluse'
    and 'most difficult man' persona established earlier, even for a moment of vulnerability.
    The bridge is good, but the intensity of the blood-licking moment might make the
    'All Is Lost' beat feel slightly less impactful as a betrayal, given the extreme
    intimacy just established.
