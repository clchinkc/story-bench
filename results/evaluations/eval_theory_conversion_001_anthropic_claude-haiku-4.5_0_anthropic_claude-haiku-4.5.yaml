  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All five Freytag beats are clearly present and well-executed.\
    \ Exposition establishes Samira's orderly world and reputation (15 years, comfortable\
    \ protocols). Rising Action escalates through 72-hour containment crisis with\
    \ evolving complications (patients, adaptation, fear). Climax peaks at the Nexus\
    \ headquarters confrontation where she discovers deliberate engineering and faces\
    \ institutional opposition. Falling Action depicts the press conference chaos\
    \ and cure distribution with immediate consequences. Denouement resolves into\
    \ new equilibrium\u2014career destroyed but integrity intact, finding peace in\
    \ exile. All 6 core elements preserved: protagonist (Samira), virus discovery\
    \ (anomalous protein), supporting character (Raj), antagonist (Nexus Biotech),\
    \ public cure release, career sacrifice. Tone maintains medical thriller tension\
    \ throughout with ethical weight evident in Samira's internal conflict and final\
    \ choice. MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Structural accuracy slightly reduced (0.95 vs 1.0)\
    \ because the climax could be more sharply defined as a single turning point\u2014\
    it spans multiple paragraphs and somewhat bleeds into falling action, though this\
    \ is a minor issue in an otherwise exemplary conversion. Tone score similarly\
    \ high (0.95) with only negligible softening in the final denouement section,\
    \ which appropriately shifts from thriller intensity to reflective resolution.\
    \ The conversion successfully transforms three-act structure into five-act pyramid\
    \ while maintaining narrative momentum and thematic coherence."
