  failed_constraints:
  - Word count 492 is below minimum of 500 (8 words short)
  - 'Missing: A trap or test requiring Zara to use thief skills (the key discovery
    is passive, not skill-based)'
  - "Missing: Clear revelation about Tom\xE1s's true motivation (his statement is\
    \ vague and mysterious, not revealing)"
  - 'Missing: Zara confronting her fear of failure (only physical danger present,
    no internal emotional confrontation)'
  - 'Missing: Symbolic death/rebirth moment in Ordeal (the ground giving way is close
    but not fully developed as transformative)'
  - 'Weak: Zara emerging from Ordeal changed (minimal character transformation shown;
    she steps forward but internal change is unclear)'
  - 'Weak: New complication at ending (darkness ahead is vague; needs more concrete
    obstacle or revelation)'
  analysis:
    beats_present_detail: "Both required beats are clearly present: 'Approach to Inmost\
      \ Cave' (discovery of Repository, sealed chamber, finding the key) and 'The\
      \ Ordeal' (ground collapse, Zara's choice to save Tom\xE1s, descent into darkness)"
    must_include_analysis:
      present:
      - "Moment where Zara must choose between escaping safely and helping Tom\xE1\
        s (grabbing his wrist when ground gives way)"
      - "Revelation about Tom\xE1s's true motivation (vague statement about 'vested\
        \ interest' - partially present but underdeveloped)"
      - Symbolic death/rebirth moment (descent into darkness, stepping into unknown
        - present but subtle)
      missing:
      - Trap or test requiring thief skills (no lock-picking, stealth, or deception
        required)
      - Zara confronting fear of failure (only physical survival instincts shown)
      - Clear transformation from Ordeal (character emerges but internal change is
        not demonstrated)
    tone_assessment: "Tense and desperate throughout with good pacing. Morally complex\
      \ elements present (Zara's distrust of Tom\xE1s, her choice to save him). Moments\
      \ of desperate hope evident (finding the key, discovering the path forward).\
      \ Minor issue: some purple prose ('darkness enveloping her like a shroud') slightly\
      \ undermines the grounded tension."
    ending_assessment: Zara has passed through the Ordeal (survived the trap, made
      the sacrifice, descended into darkness). New complication exists (trapped in
      darkness, unknown path ahead) but is somewhat vague. Stronger ending would specify
      a concrete new obstacle or revelation.
    overall_quality: 'Strong narrative momentum and clear Hero''s Journey structure.
      Excellent pacing and atmospheric writing. Primary weaknesses: insufficient word
      count, underdeveloped character motivations, and missing opportunities for Zara
      to demonstrate agency through her thief skills. The story reads well but falls
      short on specific requirement fulfillment.'
