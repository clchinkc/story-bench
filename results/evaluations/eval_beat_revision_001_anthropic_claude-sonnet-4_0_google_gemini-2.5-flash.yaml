  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The
    Ordeal as a mere boss battle and not a transformative crisis. It addressed all
    four points of the actual flaw: (1) The dragon exploits Kira''s guilt over her
    brother''s death, making it an internal confrontation. (2) Kira has a ''death''
    moment where she gives up and accepts failure. (3) A clear rebirth/transformation
    occurs as she rises with ''quiet acceptance'' and a new approach. (4) Victory
    comes from this new understanding and calm precision, not just brute force. The
    changes were significant enough to fix the flaw but still preserved the core structure
    and many original phrases, demonstrating a good balance of minimal change and
    effective revision.'
