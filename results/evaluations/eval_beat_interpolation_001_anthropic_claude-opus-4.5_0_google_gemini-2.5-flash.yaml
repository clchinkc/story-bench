  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The mentor, Marcus,
    is introduced, provides practical wisdom and tools (satchel, compass), Elena's
    doubt shifts, and her librarian skills are highlighted as useful. All 'must not'
    conditions are successfully avoided. Character consistency and bridging between
    beats are excellent.
