  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true ''All Is Lost'' moment. It addressed all points of the actual flaw: the
    fundraiser/grant failed (board voted no more fundraising, grant denied), a personal
    loss/betrayal isolated Marcus (Denise leaving, board betrayal, wife''s text about
    losing the house), Marcus genuinely gave up hope (''nothing left''), and there''s
    a strong ''whiff of death'' (loss of life''s work, family homelessness, identity/purpose).
    The changes were significant enough to fix the flaw but retained the core structure
    and opening lines, making it a good balance of minimal change and effective correction.
    All required preserved phrases are present, and the forbidden changes were avoided.
    The writing quality is excellent, enhancing the emotional impact without introducing
    new errors.'
