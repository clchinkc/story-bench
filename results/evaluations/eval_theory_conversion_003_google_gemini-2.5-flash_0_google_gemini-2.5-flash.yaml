  evidence: The story successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the Three-Act Structure.
    Act 1 covers the setup, inciting incident (Yuki's letter), and the first plot
    point (Kenji deciding to go to Kyoto). Act 2A covers the initial journey, meeting
    Haruki, and the midpoint (seeing Yuki happy). Act 2B covers the temptation of
    the business deal, Yuki's reaction, and the second plot point (Kenji declining
    the offer and apologizing). Act 3 covers the climax (Yuki finding him after the
    wedding) and the denouement (his new life in Tokyo). The structural accuracy is
    good, but the 'First Plot Point' and 'Second Plot Point' feel a little less distinct
    than they could be, blending slightly into the rising action rather than feeling
    like definitive turning points. However, they are present and serve their purpose.
    All 8 elements are preserved, and the tone is perfectly maintained.
