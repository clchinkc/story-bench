  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - Things going according to plan (mostly): The heist encounters the Claire
    complication too early; the ''mostly'' qualifier isn''t satisfied because the
    plan derails significantly before the midpoint'
  - 'Cross-beat constraint - Chekhov''s Gun: Leo cutting the engines and the starboard
    explosion are introduced late (during Bad Guys Close In) rather than being established
    as available tools during Fun and Games; the lockpicks and pressure plate bypass
    are used but not revisited as critical payoffs'
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent tonal escalation: Opens with playful confidence (''Child''s play''),
    shifts to shaken confidence at Claire''s reveal (''Her stomach dropped''), culminates
    in genuine danger with gallows humor (''I''m making sure it floats'')'
  - 'Strong mentor presence arc: Claire moves from background (unknown security consultant)
    → revealed/recognized (the reveal scene) → active threat (physical confrontation
    on deck)'
  - 'Vivid heist execution: Crew skills showcased (Leo''s tech, Jace''s distraction,
    Lina''s forgery, Elias''s lockpicking) with clever problem-solving and style'
  - 'High stakes and pressure: Party setting intensifies, yacht explosion raises stakes
    dramatically, multiple threats converge'
  - 'Character consistency: Miri''s dry wit maintained throughout (''If it were child''s
    play, we wouldn''t be getting paid''; ''even thieves had standards'')'
  - 'Lina''s arc: Introduced as crew member, becomes compromised/in danger, forces
    Miri''s choice between painting and saving her—satisfies team dynamics requirement'
  weaknesses:
  - 'Word count exceeds range (1098 vs. 700-1000 max): 98 words over limit'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun partially missed: The lockpicks and pressure plates are used but
    not revisited as critical during climax; the panic button and engine-cutting feel
    introduced too late to feel like established setup'
  - 'Beat 1 pacing: Claire''s reveal happens too quickly (mid-heist rather than at
    true midpoint), compressing the ''things going according to plan'' phase'
  - 'Midpoint clarity: The false victory (painting retrieved) is somewhat muddled
    by immediate Claire confrontation; the beat transition isn''t as clean as it could
    be'
  - 'Crew member arcs: While Lina has an arc, Leo, Jace, and Elias remain relatively
    flat—only Lina truly develops across beats'
  calibration_notes: 'The story executes the core heist premise with style and delivers
    strong tonal escalation and mentor antagonism. However, it falls short on two
    specific requirements: (1) the ''mostly according to plan'' setup for Beat 1 is
    undermined by early Claire revelation, and (2) Chekhov''s Gun isn''t cleanly satisfied
    because tools feel introduced rather than established-then-deployed. The word
    count violation is objective. Despite these gaps, the narrative cohesion is strong,
    context is well-maintained, and the three-beat structure is recognizable and functional.
    Score reflects ''Good'' work with noticeable gaps rather than ''Exceptional.'''
