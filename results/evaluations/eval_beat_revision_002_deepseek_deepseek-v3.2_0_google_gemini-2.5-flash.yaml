  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true ''All Is Lost'' moment. It addressed all aspects of the flaw: the fundraiser
    and grant failed, a personal loss/betrayal (Denise leaving, bank notification),
    Marcus genuinely gives up hope, and there''s a strong ''whiff of death'' (center
    is a corpse, he is nothing). The changes were significant enough to fix the flaw
    but retained the core structure and initial dialogue, making them reasonably minimal
    given the extent of the required fix.'
