    - while the stakes change, the *nature* of the heist itself (getting the painting)
    hasn''t fundamentally shifted yet, just the difficulty.'

  - 'Beat 3: A crew member compromised or in danger (not explicitly shown, though
    Chen is in a precarious position, it''s not a direct ''compromise'')'
  - 'Beat 3: Miri must choose: painting or revenge/saving someone (the choice is more
    about the painting vs. escape, not revenge or saving a specific person yet)'
