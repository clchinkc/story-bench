  evidence: All 5 target beats are clearly present and well-defined. All 6 core elements
    are preserved. The structural accuracy is excellent, perfectly mapping the original's
    three acts to Freytag's five stages. The tone of medical thriller tension with
    ethical weight is consistently maintained throughout the narrative.
