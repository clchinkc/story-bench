  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' for exposition. It completely rewrote the segment to demonstrate
    Rachel's detective skills, her relationship with James, her devotion to work,
    and the setting through action, dialogue, and sensory details. While the fix is
    excellent, the changes were extensive, making it a complete rewrite rather than
    minimal edits. All required preserved phrases and elements are present.
