  evidence: "All eight Dan Harmon beats are clearly present and in appropriate sequence.\
    \ All eight required elements (Zoe, library/oral-history program, Ms. Okafor,\
    \ Bernard Park, Zoe's social anxiety, town-hall presentation, Bernard's death,\
    \ and her journalism applications) are preserved. The only deduction is that the\
    \ provided word count (1298) falls outside the requested 500\u2013700 range; otherwise\
    \ structure and tone closely match the target."
