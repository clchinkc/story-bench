  failed_constraints:
  - 'CRITICAL: Word count 1380 exceeds maximum of 650 by 530 words (212% over limit)'
  - 'MISSING: Genuine connection moment between Priya and Dev (partnership focus)
    - their interactions are transactional/work-focused rather than showing emotional
    partnership depth'
  analysis:
    beats_present_detail: Fun and Games beat is strong (viral moment, customer rush,
      high energy). Midpoint false victory is well-executed (apparent success with
      judges, viral photos, packed truck, but immediately complicated by rival truck
      arrival and price undercutting).
    must_include_analysis:
      viral_moment: PRESENT - Blogger photo goes viral, Instagram share, flood of
        orders
      working_together_demand: PRESENT - Both handle rush, Dev on line duty, Priya
        cooking, coordinated effort
      rival_competitor: PRESENT - BBQChaa Truck arrives with experienced chef, price
        competition ($14 vs $8)
      midpoint_false_victory: PRESENT - Judges impressed, viral success, packed truck,
        but immediately stakes raised by rival
      genuine_partnership_connection: WEAK/MISSING - Interactions are functional (orders,
        tasks, high-fives) but lack emotional depth showing genuine partnership bond
        beyond business
      complication_hint: PRESENT - Rival truck's lower pricing, chef's experience,
        Priya's shift to aggressive strategy ('destroy them'), foreshadowing conflict
    tone_assessment: 'Upbeat energy maintained throughout with good pacing and excitement.
      Tension undercurrent present via rival arrival and Priya''s increasingly aggressive
      mindset. Minor issue: some dialogue feels forced (''birthday of flavor''), but
      overall tone is well-calibrated.'
    ending_assessment: Ends at Midpoint with apparent success (judges impressed, viral,
      packed) but stakes clearly raised (rival threat, price war, Priya's darker competitive
      impulse). Sets up next act effectively.
    critical_issue: Severe word count violation makes this unsuitable for the specified
      constraint. At 1380 words, it's more than double the 650-word maximum. This
      is a structural failure regardless of content quality.
