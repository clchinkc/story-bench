  evidence: All eight Harmon's beats are present and mapped clearly. All eight requested
    elements are preserved. Minor deduction to structural_accuracy_score because the
    'Take' beat (paying a price) is framed as responsibility/gauntlet rather than
    showing a distinct personal cost or sacrifice; otherwise the sequence is very
    faithful. Minor deduction to tone_score only for a few moments where narrative
    moves briskly through later developments (Bernard's death, application to journalism)
    rather than dwelling as long as earlier intimate scenes.
