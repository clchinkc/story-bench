  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas
    (quarters, medical bay, labs), uncovers clues (tablet, audio log), encounters
    the transformed crew as shimmers, and overcomes an obstacle (bypassing power/safety
    to open Lab Seven). None of the prohibited items occur (no premature full understanding
    or data-core discovery during the Search, no direct explanations from the crew,
    no abandoning the mission, and Yuki did not already know about the transformation).
    Setting and character behavior remain consistent and the Search cleanly leads
    into the subsequent Find beat.'
