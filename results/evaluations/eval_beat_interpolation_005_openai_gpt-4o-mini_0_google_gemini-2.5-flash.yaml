  evidence: Word count is slightly over the limit. Character score is 0.8 because
    while the shift in Alejandro is well-executed, his initial 'I don't eat much these
    days' feels a little too quickly overcome by the 'just a taste' suggestion, given
    his established reclusive nature. Bridge score is 0.8 because it sets up the emotional
    connection well, but the 'All Is Lost' beat feels like a very sharp turn from
    this moment, implying a significant event happened between them that isn't fully
    foreshadowed here beyond the general 'deeper connection'.
