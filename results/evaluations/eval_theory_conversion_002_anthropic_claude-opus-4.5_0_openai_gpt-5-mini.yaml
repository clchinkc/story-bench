  evidence: "All 12 Campbellian beats are present and follow a clear sequence: Ordinary\
    \ World (village potter), Call (dry spring), Refusal (three days of saying no),\
    \ Meeting the Mentor (grandmother's shawl/memory), Crossing the Threshold (journey\
    \ to mountain), Tests/Allies/Enemies (rockslides, shepherd, hawk, doubt), Approach\
    \ to Inmost Cave (ruined shrine, despair), Ordeal (surrendering control and creating\
    \ the vessel), Reward (the completed vessel), The Road Back (difficult return\
    \ with doubts), Resurrection (letting old self go and performing ceremony), Return\
    \ with Elixir (water returns and she teaches). All seven required elements are\
    \ preserved. Deduction from a perfect structural score (0.05) is for minor compression/interpretive\
    \ choices: the mentor is a remembered presence rather than an external guide,\
    \ and the Approach/Ordeal are tightly compressed\u2014effective but slightly condensed\
    \ compared with some classic monomyth elaborations."
