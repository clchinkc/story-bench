  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The Ordeal
    as a mere boss battle and not a transformative crisis. It successfully integrated
    Kira's deepest fear (guilt over her brother's death) into the dragon's dialogue,
    creating a 'death' moment where she accepts her guilt and a subsequent rebirth/transformation
    where she rises with new understanding. The victory then stems from this insight,
    not just persistence. The changes were significant enough to address the flaw
    but maintained the core structure and many original phrases, making them reasonably
    minimal for the scope of the fix.
