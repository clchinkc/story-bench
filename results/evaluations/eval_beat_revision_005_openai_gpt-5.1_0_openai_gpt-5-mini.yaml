  evidence: 'The model explicitly responded ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' and gave a clear
    justification: it cited the gallery closure as the All Is Lost moment, noted Maya''s
    isolation (dark apartment, unreturned calls), described genuine despair and internal
    reflection (holding knees, tears, feeling she failed her mother), pointed out
    there are no solutions offered yet, and identified a ''whiff of death'' (mother''s
    hospice memory and the dead gallery).'
