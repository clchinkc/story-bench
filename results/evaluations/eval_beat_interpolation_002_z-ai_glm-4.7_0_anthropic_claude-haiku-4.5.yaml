  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: The passage effectively shows Sarah wrestling with the recanting
    option (element 1), considering official channels through Marcus Webb (element
    2), and internal conflict between duty and sister (element 3). The debate beat''s
    narrative function is largely executed—Sarah genuinely deliberates before committing.
    Character voice is consistent and compelling. Bridge to Break Into Two is seamless;
    resignation letter provides natural transition. Continuity maintained well from
    Catalyst. WEAKNESSES: Missing element 4—no clear ''tipping moment'' that pushes
    her toward the third option (going rogue). The decision feels somewhat abrupt
    rather than catalyzed by a specific revelation. VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah already
    begins acting as vigilante by end of beat (''former detective, current vigilante...sat
    in rented car''), which partially skips the debate and enters Break Into Two territory
    prematurely. (2) The ''After'' section explicitly shows her having already resigned
    and begun surveillance, violating the must-not about ''already having resigned
    from the police force'' during the Debate beat itself. The Debate should end with
    the decision to resign, not with her already resigned and in action. These violations
    represent a 50% deduction from must_not_score (2 violations out of 4 must-nots).'
