  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
      Search: Present - Jin navigates factions (Agrarians, Engineers, Dispersants),
        processes asylum, encounters Veyra's demands, learns from Marin about the
        Collective's true nature
      Find: Present - Jin discovers the suppressed technology is already known to
        Marin; learns the Collective is complicit with megacorps; finds what he thought
        he wanted (platform/safety) is illusory
      Take: Present - Jin redirects virus to factory schematics, initiates asset destruction,
        accepts complicity in the cartel, pays moral price of conscience
    must_include_detail:
      1_unfamiliar_culture: Excellent - Detailed navigation of orbital politics, faction
        systems, survival culture, language mashup, gravity shifts, black-market dynamics
      2_mentor_figure: Excellent - Marin serves as guide, reveals hidden truths about
        Collective, teaches survival pragmatism vs. idealism
      3_unexpected_discovery: Excellent - Carbon scrubber technology already exists;
        Collective suppresses it like Earth governments; conspiracy is systemic, not
        isolated
      4_finds_what_wanted: Excellent - Jin obtains platform to broadcast findings
        and server access, but discovers it's compromised by cartel interests
      5_action_with_cost: Excellent - Redirects virus to destroy factories; cost is
        moral compromise, complicity, loss of idealism
      6_moral_compromise: Excellent - Jin chooses sabotage over transparency; accepts
        'welcome to the cartel' reality; conscience becomes casualty
    must_not_detail:
      1_easy_integration: Avoided - Jin faces suspicion, demands for loyalty, bureaucratic
        obstacles, faction pressure; integration is hostile and conditional
      2_earth_family_contact: Avoided - Only brief reference to 'Yuna' watching fallout;
        no actual contact or communication
      3_violence_weapons: Avoided - Sabotage is digital/economic (virus, factory destruction);
        no physical violence or weapons
      4_complete_resolution: Avoided - Conspiracy remains active; Jin's actions are
        beginning of larger conflict; no resolution of systemic corruption
    tone_assessment: 'Contemplative and politically charged throughout. Personal stakes
      (Jin''s exile, conscience) amid larger conflict (cartel systems, climate tech
      suppression) are well-balanced. Cynical realism about power structures. Minor
      deduction: could deepen introspection in final moments.'
    ending_assessment: Ends precisely at 'Take' beat. Jin has gained server access
      and platform but paid price of moral compromise and complicity. Closing image
      ('stars outside were cold, indifferent') reinforces contemplative tone and personal
      cost. Excellent alignment with requirement.
    critical_issue: Word count is 69 words short of minimum. This is a significant
      constraint violation (12.5% below range). Story is otherwise exceptionally well-executed—all
      beats present, all required elements included, all forbidden elements avoided,
      tone and ending excellent. The shortfall is the only material failure.
  overall_score: 0.78
  score_rationale: Exceptional execution of narrative structure, character development,
    thematic complexity, and tone (would score 0.95+), but word count constraint violation
    (481 vs. 550 minimum) is a hard requirement that cannot be waived. Deduction of
    ~0.17 points for this objective failure, resulting in 0.78 overall. Story demonstrates
    mastery of Story Circle application and all qualitative requirements.
