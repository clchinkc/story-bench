  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Multiple
    station areas explored (crew quarters, med bay, hydroponics, operations, lab sector)
    with vivid environmental detail; (2) Clues systematically discovered (unmade bunks,
    cold coffee, restraint harness, Reyes''s fragmented logs, encrypted orders, plant
    mutations, ''field harmonics'' references); (3) Transformed crew encountered as
    mysterious distortions—heat shimmer, EM field anomalies, invisible pressure, motion
    without form—creating genuine mystery; (4) Multiple obstacles overcome (scanner
    failures, temperature drops, hostile entity surge, sealed bulkhead, navigation
    around hazards). MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS: Zero violations. Yuki does NOT immediately
    find the core (she locates it only at the end, still disconnecting it). She does
    NOT receive direct explanations (Reyes''s voice is fragmented, cryptic). She does
    NOT decide to leave (she presses forward). She does NOT know about dimensional
    transformation beforehand (she discovers it through environmental clues and inference).
    EXECUTION: The Search beat functions perfectly—Yuki actively adapts to each discovery,
    escalates her understanding incrementally, faces genuine peril, and maintains
    agency throughout. Her scientific method (logging anomalies, following evidence
    chains, using remaining tools) drives the narrative. CONTINUITY: Seamless bridge
    from ''Go'' beat (arrival) through ''Search'' (exploration/discovery) to ''Find''
    beat (core location). Setting details consistent (red emergency lighting, station
    layout, Jupiter viewport). Character voice remains consistent—methodical, analytical,
    courageous. DEDUCTION: Word count exceeds range by 166 words (566 vs. 250-400
    max), which is a technical violation but does not diminish narrative quality or
    beat execution.'
  overall_assessment: Exceptional execution of the Search beat. This is professional-quality
    story work that fully satisfies all narrative requirements while exceeding them
    in depth and sophistication.
