  evidence: 'All 12 Hero''s Journey beats are present and in order. All 7 required
    elements (Maya protagonist, pottery focus, grandmother''s legacy, mountain shrine
    journey, dried spring problem, theme of surrender, Maya''s transformation) are
    preserved. The only criterion not met is word count: the converted text is 811
    words, exceeding the specified maximum of 800, so word_count_valid is false. (Note:
    the ''Meeting the Mentor'' is rendered as the grandmother''s memory rather than
    a living mentor, which fits the monomyth and was not deducted.)'
