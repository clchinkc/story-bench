  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—that the original
    segment lacked true hopelessness and still contained viable options. The revision
    addresses all five required elements: (1) fundraiser revealed as insufficient,
    (2) grant explicitly rejected, (3) personal betrayal/isolation through Denise''s
    job-hunting revelation and subsequent departure, (4) Marcus genuinely giving up
    (''The hell we will''), and (5) whiff of death through the lost son and metaphorical
    death of identity (''rotunda ceilings look like coffins''). PRESERVATION: All
    4 required phrases present: ''Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands''
    (exact), ''Thirty days to vacate the community center'' (exact), ''"There has
    to be something we can do," said Denise'' (exact), ''He rubbed his temples'' (exact).
    All 4 story elements preserved: Marcus as protagonist, community center setting,
    eviction crisis, Denise present throughout. MINIMAL CHANGES: The revision is NOT
    minimally surgical—it''s a moderate expansion (299 words vs ~180 original). The
    model added substantial new content: grant rejection email, Denise''s job-hunting
    revelation, the son''s backstory/accident, the coffin metaphor, the confrontation
    scene, and emotional escalation. However, these additions are narratively justified
    and necessary to fix the beat. The structure and opening remain intact, but middle/end
    sections are substantially rewritten rather than surgically edited. BEAT EXECUTION:
    Excellent execution of All Is Lost. Marcus moves from ''maybe'' to ''no.'' Support
    systems collapse (Denise leaves, wife absent, grant denied). The ''whiff of death''
    is multi-layered: literal loss of son, metaphorical death of purpose/identity,
    and the center''s impending death. Emotional tone shifts from ''setback'' to ''devastation.''
    QUALITY: Strong writing with effective imagery, emotional authenticity, and no
    new errors. The bitter laugh, the coffin metaphor, and the final ''Alone'' are
    particularly effective. Minor: The confrontation with Denise feels slightly rushed
    but serves the narrative purpose.'
error: null
