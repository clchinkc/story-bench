  evidence: 'All 4 required elements present: (1) Multiple station areas explored
    (medical bay, lab section, command center, Lab Seven referenced); (2) Clues discovered
    progressively (radiation isotopes, suspended objects, Dimensional Bridge Hypothesis
    document, half-written log); (3) Transformed crew encountered as mysterious shimmers
    with layered breathing and heat distortion effects; (4) Obstacles overcome (scanner
    malfunction, pursuit forcing retreat, need to interpret cryptic messages). The
    Search beat executes perfectly—Yuki actively navigates, adapts understanding incrementally,
    faces genuine trials. All must-not violations avoided: she doesn''t immediately
    find the data core (only locates it at end), crew doesn''t explain everything
    directly (only fragmented communication), she commits to mission completion, and
    she arrives without prior knowledge of transformation. Character voice remains
    consistent—scientific, observant, initially fearful then compassionate. Seamless
    bridge from ''Go'' (arrival in darkness) to ''Search'' (exploration and discovery)
    to ''Find'' (locating data core). Setting continuity perfect: red emergency lighting,
    zero-g environment, Jupiter vista, station systems all maintained. Word count
    365 within valid range.'
