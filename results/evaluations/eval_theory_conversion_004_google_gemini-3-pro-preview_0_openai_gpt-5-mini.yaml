  evidence: 'All eight Dan Harmon beats are clearly and sequentially present: You
    (library comfort), Need (hollow desire to be seen), Go (accepting recorder/visiting
    Bernard), Search (learning to interview and adapt), Find (breakthrough with Bernard
    about listening), Take (Town Hall presentation as the cost of carrying the story),
    Return (summer ends, back to library), Change (funeral speech and applying to
    journalism). All eight required elements (Zoe protagonist, library/oral-history
    program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard Park, Zoe''s social anxiety, Town Hall presentation,
    Bernard''s death, journalism application) are preserved. The piece maps cleanly
    to Harmon''s Story Circle and maintains the requested gentle, intimate, emotionally
    true tone. No deductions applied.'
