  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;\
    \ he provides practical wisdom and tools (satchel, compass, advice about intentions\
    \ and librarian skills); Elena's doubt shifts to reluctant acceptance (she agrees\
    \ to go and to document the journey); Marcus frames her librarian skills as useful.\
    \ None of the prohibited items appear (she does not become immediately confident,\
    \ Marcus does not solve her problems or accompany her, she is not in/near the\
    \ forest in this beat, and no magical powers are revealed). The only deduction\
    \ is that the word count is invalid (generated text = 572 words, outside required\
    \ 200\u2013350). No other issues found."
