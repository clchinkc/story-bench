  failed_items:
  - Beat 1 - Clever problem-solving is minimal; Jake disables security with 'a few
    taps' but lacks the detailed, inventive solutions expected from Ocean's Eleven-style
    heists
  - 'Cross-beat constraint - Chekhov''s Gun partially weak: The emergency exit through
    crew quarters is mentioned but never actually used or paid off in the narrative;
    the setup doesn''t cleanly connect to payoff'
  strengths:
  - 'Beat 1 (Fun and Games): Strong crew introduction with distinct roles (Jake/tech,
    Clara/charm, Sam/muscle); playful banter (''don''t get us arrested rule'') establishes
    tone; mostly smooth execution with minor complication (crash)'
  - "Beat 2 (Midpoint): Excellent false victory (painting within reach); dramatic\
    \ stakes escalation via mysterious text message; Ren\xE9e's reveal is impactful\
    \ and personal; party setting amplifies pressure effectively"
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In): Security actively pursuing; Sam pinned by guards
    creates immediate danger; Miri''s choice between painting and crew member is genuine
    moral dilemma; walls closing in both literally (narrow passages) and figuratively
    (trapped)'
  - "Tonal Escalation: Clear progression from playful confidence ('Like a cat burglar\
    \ rule?') \u2192 shaken confidence ('dark cloud loomed') \u2192 genuine danger\
    \ and gallows humor ('reclaiming her story')"
  - "Mentor Presence: Ren\xE9e arc is well-executed\u2014background threat \u2192\
    \ revealed antagonist \u2192 active threat with personal vendetta"
  - "Team Dynamics: Jake has consistent arc (confident tech wizard \u2192 protesting\
    \ the dangerous choice \u2192 present during crisis), affecting plot decisions"
  - 'Context Maintenance: Miri''s characterization (dry wit, meticulous planner, wrongful
    accusation backstory) is woven throughout; Monaco/yacht setting vivid; Ocean''s
    Eleven tone achieved through crew dynamics and banter'
  - 'Coherence: Narrative flows logically from setup through complications to climactic
    choice; emotional stakes build naturally'
  weaknesses:
  - 'Problem-solving lacks specificity: The security bypass (''a few taps'') feels
    generic compared to the detailed, clever solutions promised by the heist premise'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun execution incomplete: Emergency exit/crew quarters passage is
    mentioned but never utilized; setup doesn''t pay off convincingly'
  - 'Sam''s characterization underdeveloped: Introduced as ''muscle'' but disappears
    mid-heist, limiting his arc across beats'
  - 'Minor pacing issue: Transition from ''painting within reach'' to ''chaos erupted''
    feels slightly abrupt; could use one more beat of tension before full security
    response'
  overall_assessment: This is a strong, well-structured narrative that successfully
    executes the Save the Cat framework across three critical beats. The story maintains
    excellent context fidelity, delivers on tone escalation, and creates genuine emotional
    stakes through Miri's choice. The primary weaknesses are the underdeveloped problem-solving
    mechanics (expected in a heist) and an incomplete Chekhov's Gun payoff. The mentor
    antagonist arc is particularly well-handled. This reads as a polished scene from
    a professional heist thriller with art-world sophistication.
