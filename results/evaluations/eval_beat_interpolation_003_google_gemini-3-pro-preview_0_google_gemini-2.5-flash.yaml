  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores the mess hall and medical
    bay, discovers clues like the dried coffee spill, smashed monitors, and flatlining
    biometrics, encounters the ''distortion'' which is a mysterious transformed crew
    member, and overcomes the jammed medical bay door and the dead lift by taking
    the maintenance ladder. All ''must not'' items were successfully avoided. The
    character remains consistent, acting as a scientist investigating a mystery. The
    bridge from ''Before'' to ''Search'' is seamless, with Yuki actively searching
    after her initial call. The continuity of the station''s state (emergency lighting,
    groaning hull) is maintained.'
