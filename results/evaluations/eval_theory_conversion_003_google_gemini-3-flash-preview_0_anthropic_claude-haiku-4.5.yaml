  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Act 1 establishes Kenji''s hollow victory and the inciting incident (Yuki''s letter).
    Act 2A develops obstacles through village life and Haruki''s mentorship, with
    a clear midpoint at the festival. Act 2B escalates complications via the business
    deal temptation and Yuki''s rejection, culminating in the dark night realization.
    Act 3 delivers climax (wedding day restraint) and denouement (bamboo shop). All
    8 core elements preserved: protagonist, lost career, estranged daughter, Kyoto
    wedding, Haruki, business temptation, thematic choice, and craft shop ending.
    Tone is consistently quiet, contemplative, and aesthetically Japanese throughout.
    DEDUCTIONS: Word count exceeds target range by 61 words (811 vs. 550-750 max),
    which is a 10.8% overage—minor but measurable. Structural accuracy slightly reduced
    (0.9 vs. 1.0) because the transition between Act 2A and 2B could be more sharply
    delineated; the midpoint festival scene bleeds into complications without a clear
    structural marker. Otherwise, the conversion from Save the Cat to three-act structure
    is exemplary, with strong narrative coherence and thematic resonance.'
