  evidence: "All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-delineated: (1) Exposition\
    \ establishes Samira's 15-year reputation and the anomalous protein discovery;\
    \ (2) Rising Action depicts the 72-hour escalation with containment, quarantine,\
    \ and evolving symptoms; (3) Climax peaks at the Nexus Biotech revelation and\
    \ press conference confrontation; (4) Falling Action shows immediate aftermath\
    \ with Nexus damage control and federal investigation; (5) Denouement resolves\
    \ with Samira's new equilibrium\u2014blacklisted but ethically intact. All 6 core\
    \ elements preserved: protagonist (Samira), engineered virus, Raj (assistant),\
    \ Nexus (antagonist), public cure release, career sacrifice. Structure transitions\
    \ smoothly from 3-act to 5-stage pyramid with clear escalation and consequence\
    \ flow. Tone maintains medical thriller tension throughout with consistent ethical\
    \ weight\u2014the dilemma between career security and truth-telling permeates\
    \ the narrative. Minor deduction (0.05 each) for: structural_accuracy\u2014the\
    \ transition between Rising Action and Climax could be slightly sharper; tone\u2014\
    one brief moment of philosophical reflection in denouement slightly softens thriller\
    \ intensity but appropriately so for resolution. Word count valid at 577 (within\
    \ 500-700 range)."
