  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: multiple areas explored (crew
    quarters, medical bay, path toward Lab Seven), discovery of logs and autopsy clues,
    encounters with shimmering transformed crew, and concrete obstacles overcome (counter-frequency
    pulse, hacking override). No forbidden items occur. The only deduction is word
    count: the passage is 472 words, exceeding the 250–400 range by 72 words.'
