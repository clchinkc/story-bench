  evidence: The story successfully incorporates all four target beats and preserves
    all eight core elements. However, the structural accuracy is slightly off because
    the 'First Plot Point' is not explicitly defined or clearly separated from the
    'Inciting Incident' in the Act 1 description. The 'Second Plot Point' is also
    a bit soft, feeling more like a turning point within the rising action rather
    than a definitive shift into Act 3. The tone is well-maintained, but the word
    count is too high.
