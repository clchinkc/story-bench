  evidence: 'The model targeted the correct problem: the All Is Lost beat lacked hopelessness
    and isolation. It removes the wife''s comforting text, tightens language to show
    plans "crumbled," and depicts Denise turning away so Marcus is left alone — creating
    a much lower emotional point. However, it stops short of fully implementing the
    required fixes: the fundraiser is only implied to be hopeless rather than shown
    failed, the grant is described as a "cruel fantasy" rather than explicitly rejected
    or revealed corrupt, and there is no concrete personal betrayal or literal ''whiff
    of death'' beyond metaphorical loss. Changes were moderate: core sentences and
    characters were preserved (all four required phrases present or near-present),
    but several lines were rewritten to amplify despair, so edits were not purely
    surgical.'
