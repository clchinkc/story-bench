  evidence: 'The model completely failed to recognize that the ORIGINAL SEGMENT was
    correctly executed. Instead, the model provided a full rewrite/revision of the
    segment under the guise of a ''MODEL''S RESPONSE''. This is a critical false positive
    error. The model should have stated ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' but instead generated
    an entirely new version of the Dark Night of the Soul beat. While the model''s
    rewrite does demonstrate some understanding of the beat (isolation, despair, reflection,
    no solutions), it fundamentally misunderstood the task: the original segment was
    already excellent and needed no changes. The model''s response shows it either:
    (1) didn''t recognize the original was well-executed, or (2) attempted to ''improve''
    something that was already correct. The rewrite, while competent, is unnecessary
    and represents over-diagnosis. The model failed the core requirement of recognizing
    when a segment is correctly executed.'
