  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Exposition establishes Samira''s 15-year reputation and the impossible virus discovery.
    Rising Action escalates through 72-hour containment crisis and the Nexus Biotech
    revelation. Climax peaks at the press conference decision and formula release.
    Falling Action shows immediate consequences (lawsuits, career destruction, Nexus
    retaliation). Denouement provides new equilibrium with Geneva lab offer. All 6
    core elements preserved: protagonist, engineered virus, Raj, Nexus antagonist,
    public cure release, career sacrifice. Tone is consistently tense, ethically weighted
    medical thriller with strong narrative voice. DEDUCTIONS: Word count exceeds target
    by 175 words (25% over limit), violating specified constraint. Structural accuracy
    slightly reduced because the conversion adds substantial new plot details (senator
    threat, press conference specifics, Geneva offer) not in original source material—while
    this enriches the narrative, it technically goes beyond pure conversion. Tone
    is excellent but occasionally veers toward literary melodrama (''voice like polished
    steel,'' ''scalpel'') which slightly softens pure thriller tension. Minor: The
    denouement could be slightly more concise to meet word count requirement.'
