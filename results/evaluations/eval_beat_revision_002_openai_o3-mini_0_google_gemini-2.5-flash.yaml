  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true 'All Is Lost' moment. It addressed the lack of complete failure, the presence
    of options, and the intact support system. The revision explicitly states that
    'every plan had crumbled,' 'each avenue of escape had vanished,' and that Marcus
    felt 'alone amidst the echoes of his shattered dreams,' with 'no one left to shoulder
    the burden beside him.' It also introduces a 'whiff of death' metaphorically with
    the 'irretrievable loss' and the 'barren' future. The changes were moderate, expanding
    on existing dialogue and adding internal monologue to convey the despair, rather
    than a complete rewrite.
