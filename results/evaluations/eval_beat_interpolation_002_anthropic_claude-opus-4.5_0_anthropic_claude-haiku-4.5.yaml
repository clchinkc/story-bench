  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Recanting\
    \ option explicitly considered with moral weight ('families of his seven confirmed\
    \ victims'). (2) Official channels thoroughly debated through Marcus conversation\
    \ ('FBI has resources...jurisdictional nightmare'). (3) Internal conflict powerfully\
    \ rendered through physical reaction and hesitation ('couldn't quite discard it').\
    \ (4) The warehouse recognition moment serves as the tipping point toward the\
    \ third option. Beat function executed perfectly\u2014Sarah wrestles with genuine\
    \ alternatives before committing. Character voice remains consistent and authentic\
    \ throughout. VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah has already decided to resign and is executing\
    \ it ('resignation letter in one hand and her badge in the other') in the AFTER\
    \ section, which violates 'Sarah already having resigned from the police force'\
    \ during the Debate beat itself. (2) The AFTER section shows her already outside\
    \ Morrison's office with letter in hand, which technically means the decision\
    \ is made before the beat ends, compressing the debate's narrative space. However,\
    \ the GENERATED section (the actual Debate beat) avoids this\u2014the decision\
    \ happens at the end of the Debate, not during it. The violation appears in the\
    \ bridge/transition rather than the beat itself. MINOR: Bridge is strong but the\
    \ transition to 'Break Into Two' happens slightly abruptly; could use one more\
    \ sentence of reflection. Continuity maintained well\u2014warehouse detail callbacks,\
    \ timeline (70 hours), character relationships all consistent."
