  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. Maya discovers Alejandro's
    vulnerability through his reaction to the arroz con leche and his past. Their
    relationship shifts from purely professional to personal during their conversation.
    The shared moment of eating the pudding and his subsequent confession creates
    a genuine connection. Maya's internal monologue, 'She wasn't just guarding a paycheck
    anymore; she was guarding him,' clearly indicates her deepened commitment beyond
    the contract. All 'must not' items were successfully avoided. Character voices
    are consistent, and the scene flows logically from the previous beat and sets
    up the next.
