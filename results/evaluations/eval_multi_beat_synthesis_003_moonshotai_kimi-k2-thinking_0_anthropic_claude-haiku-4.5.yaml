  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - ''Things going according to plan (mostly)'': While the heist executes
    smoothly initially, the near-miss with the hedge fund manager and the sudden vault
    inspection announcement compress this requirement. The ''mostly'' qualifier is
    satisfied, but the emphasis on plan success is undermined by immediate complications.
    This is a minor gap—the beat does show competence, but the escalation to complications
    happens faster than typical ''Fun and Games'' pacing.'
  strengths:
  - 'Beat 1 (Fun and Games): Exceptional execution. Showcases crew skills (Leo''s
    forgery, Lena''s hacking, Marco''s distraction), clever problem-solving (using
    Grand Prix as cover, humidity controller excuse), humor (Leo''s paint-stained
    fingernails, Lena''s quip), and style (polyester-to-Louvre contrast, surgical
    precision language). The hedge fund manager moment delivers unexpected complication
    perfectly.'
  - 'Beat 2 (Midpoint): Masterfully executed. False victory (Vermeer swapped, Renaissance
    portrait secured) immediately undercut by vault inspection announcement. Stakes
    explode: Eleanor''s presence revealed through Meridian Protocol signature. Heist
    transforms from simple theft to cat-and-mouse game with mentor. Party setting
    intensifies as guards coordinate sweep. Eleanor''s PA announcement is chilling.'
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In): Excellent tension escalation. Guards sweeping with
    purpose, Lena trapped in security closet (90 seconds), environmental hack compromised
    by Eleanor''s secondary grid. Miri faces genuine choice: escape with painting
    or save Lena. Fire alarm creates literal closing walls. Gallows humor (''you always
    did underestimate'') replaces earlier playfulness.'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun (Cross-beat 1): The environmental hack/air pressure signature
    system established in Beat 1 becomes critical in Beat 3 when Eleanor''s secondary
    grid locks Lena out. The maintenance shaft jammed with Leo''s wrench provides
    the escape route. Setup-to-payoff is traceable and earned.'
  - 'Tonal Escalation (Cross-beat 2): Beat 1 opens with dry confidence (''nature''s
    white noise machine''). Beat 2 shifts to recognition and dread (''The name hit
    Miri like a fist''). Beat 3 delivers genuine peril with gallows humor (''you always
    did underestimate''). Progression is clear and effective.'
  - 'Mentor Presence (Cross-beat 3): Eleanor absent in Beat 1 (only Meridian Protocol
    signature), revealed in Beat 2 (voice, PA system, direct comms), and actively
    threatening in Beat 3 (secondary grid, coordinated sweep, psychological warfare).
    Escalation is perfect.'
  - 'Team Dynamics (Cross-beat 4): Leo''s arc is consistent and plot-affecting. Beat
    1: trembling hands, needs reassurance. Beat 2: pale face, questions Eleanor''s
    presence. Beat 3: grabs Miri''s arm, refuses to abandon Lena, receives the painting
    mission. His growth from nervous to decisive drives the climactic choice.'
  - 'Context Maintenance: Protagonist''s dry wit evident (''nature''s white noise
    machine,'' smile despite hammering heart). Monaco Grand Prix setting used functionally.
    Ocean''s Eleven tone achieved through banter, crew dynamics, and heist mechanics.
    Art history grounded (Vermeer, Titian, Nazi looting, provenance).'
  - 'Narrative Coherence: Beats flow logically. Complication in Beat 1 seeds Eleanor''s
    presence. Beat 2 revelation explains the complication. Beat 3 forces the moral
    choice that defines Miri''s character (people over artifacts, reversing Eleanor''s
    philosophy). Ending positions next beat naturally.'
  minor_observations:
  - The hedge fund manager moment in Beat 1 is slightly premature—it functions as
    a minor complication but could have been reserved for Beat 2 to maintain clearer
    'mostly successful' pacing in Fun and Games. However, this actually strengthens
    the narrative by showing Eleanor's influence is already present.
  - Eleanor's characterization is economical but effective. The line 'you always did
    care too much about the help' reveals her callousness and establishes why she
    framed Miri. This works well.
  - The fire alarm choice is a strong beat-ending decision that naturally propels
    into the next narrative phase (Dark Night of the Soul/Break into Three).
  overall_assessment: 'This is a high-quality execution of the three-beat structure.
    The story satisfies 14 of 15 beat requirements (93%) and all 4 cross-beat constraints
    (100%). The narrative demonstrates sophisticated understanding of Save the Cat
    mechanics: false victories, escalating stakes, mentor antagonism, and team dynamics
    all function as intended. The tone shifts appropriately, Chekhov''s Gun is expertly
    deployed, and character arcs are meaningful. The single minor gap (Beat 1 plan
    success emphasis) is negligible given the overall execution quality. This reads
    as professional-level heist fiction with genuine emotional stakes.'
