  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Multiple
    station areas explored (mess hall, medical bay, maintenance ladder, research level);
    (2) Clues discovered progressively (overturned tray, smashed monitors, biometric
    data showing simultaneous flatlines, absence of bodies); (3) Transformed crew
    encountered as mysterious shimmer/distortion entities with vague humanoid shape—identity
    unclear until final beat; (4) Multiple obstacles overcome (jammed medical bay
    door, dead lift requiring ladder descent, hostile entity encounter, psychological
    pressure of being watched). BEAT EXECUTION: Perfectly executes Search phase—active
    navigation, trial-and-error problem solving, incremental discovery, mounting tension,
    adaptation to unfamiliar threats. Yuki grounds herself in scientific method while
    facing incomprehensible phenomena. MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS: Zero violations. Yuki
    does NOT immediately understand the transformation, does NOT receive full explanations
    from crew, does NOT abandon mission, does NOT arrive with prior knowledge. Commander
    Reyes only speaks at the very end (AFTER section), not during Search. CONTINUITY:
    Seamless connection between BEFORE (arrival, silence, mystery) and GENERATED (exploration,
    discovery, escalation) and AFTER (revelation, choice). Setting details consistent
    (red emergency lighting, station systems, spatial layout). CHARACTER: Yuki''s
    voice remains consistent—scientific, methodical, brave but cautious, grounding
    panic in data. WORD COUNT ISSUE: 422 words exceeds 400-word maximum by 22 words
    (5.5% overage). This is a technical violation but minor given content quality.'
