  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Sarah considers recanting, she
    considers official channels (goes to precinct, asks Marcus for task force), the
    internal conflict between duty and sister is explicit, and a conversation with
    Marcus plus her realization tips her toward the third option. None of the forbidden
    items appear. Character behavior and voice are consistent and the scene cleanly
    sets up the subsequent Break into Two without continuity issues.'
