  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he provides practical tools (satchel, compass, ink, journal) and pragmatic wisdom;
    Elena''s doubt shifts toward reluctant acceptance (swallows, compass steadies,
    thinks of cataloging); her librarian skills are explicitly referenced as useful.
    None of the forbidden items occur: she does not become immediately confident,
    Marcus does not solve her problems or offer to accompany her, the scene is set
    in the curiosity shop (not the forest), and Elena does not discover magical powers.
    Setting and character behavior remain consistent with prior beat.'
