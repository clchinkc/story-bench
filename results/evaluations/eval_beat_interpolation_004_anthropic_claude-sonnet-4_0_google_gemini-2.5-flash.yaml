  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Thomas''s direct examination, a moment
    where she almost recants, Thomas''s decisive action (the offer regarding Maya),
    and the turning point where truth prevails. All ''must not'' items were successfully
    avoided. Character consistency and continuity are strong, and the bridge between
    beats is seamless.'
