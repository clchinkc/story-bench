  evidence: The model made revisions to the original segment, indicating it did not
    recognize it as correctly executed. It added details like 'taped inside the front
    window like a verdict,' 'as if silence could keep him safe from her failure,'
    and expanded on the hospice scene and Maya's internal monologue. While these additions
    are not necessarily 'wrong' for the beat, they are unnecessary given the original
    segment was already correct.
