  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-delineated.
    Exposition establishes Samira''s 15-year reputation and the impossible discovery.
    Rising Action spans the 72-hour quarantine with escalating complications (evolving
    symptoms, failed tests). Climax peaks with the Nexus confrontation (legal threats,
    senator, revelation of design). Falling Action executes the press conference strategy
    and information release. Denouement provides 6-week resolution with Samira''s
    career sacrifice and moral victory. All 6 core elements preserved: protagonist
    (Samira), engineered virus discovery (explicitly revealed as Nexus design), Raj
    (present throughout), Nexus antagonist (clearly positioned), public cure release
    (transmitted globally), career sacrifice (blacklisted but at peace). Tone maintains
    medical thriller tension with ethical weight throughout—hazmat suits, escalating
    panic, predatory corporate language, moral dilemma framing. MINOR DEDUCTIONS:
    Structural accuracy -0.05 for slight narrative compression in Rising Action (could
    have extended complications further). Tone -0.05 for occasional melodramatic flourishes
    (''theater of war,'' ''predatory smiles'') that slightly exceed clinical thriller
    restraint, though this enhances rather than detracts. Word count perfectly within
    range (536/500-700). Conversion successfully transforms 3-act linear progression
    into 5-act pyramid structure with clear turning point and consequence exploration.'
