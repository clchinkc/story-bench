  evidence: 'All 12 Campbell beats are represented: Ordinary World (village pottery),
    Call (dried spring), Refusal (initial refusal), Meeting the Mentor (grandmother''s
    journal), Crossing (journey up mountain), Tests/Allies/Enemies (physical and internal
    trials during climb and descent—no distinct allies or antagonists), Approach (arriving
    at shrine), Ordeal (the night of surrender/creation), Reward (the completed vessel),
    Road Back (difficult descent and temptation to abandon), Resurrection (final test
    at the spring), Return with Elixir (water returns; village saved; Maya transformed).
    All 7 required elements are preserved. Deduction from a perfect structural score
    (0.05) is for a minor structural compression: the Mentor is mediated through a
    journal rather than an interpersonal mentor, and the ''Allies/Enemies'' subbeat
    is handled mainly as internal/environmental tests rather than distinct characters.'
