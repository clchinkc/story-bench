  evidence: "All four required elements present: (1) Marcus introduced as mentor character\
    \ with clear wisdom-keeper role; (2) practical wisdom provided ('maps are stories,'\
    \ compass as tool, advice about instincts vs logic) plus tangible gift (brass\
    \ compass); (3) Elena's doubt shifts from 'I can't do this' to 'nodded slowly,\
    \ reluctant acceptance blossoming'; (4) librarian skills explicitly reframed as\
    \ valuable ('who better to unravel a story than a librarian'). All must-not violations\
    \ avoided: Elena remains doubtful/reluctant (not confident/eager), Marcus provides\
    \ guidance only and explicitly does not accompany her, setting is outside forest\
    \ at curiosity shop (not in forest), no magical powers discovered. Character voice\
    \ consistent\u2014Elena maintains her self-deprecating librarian persona while\
    \ Marcus embodies warm, knowing mentor archetype. Bridge is seamless: directly\
    \ follows refusal beat and leads naturally into threshold crossing. Continuity\
    \ perfect: satchel mentioned in AFTER section is established here as 'Marcus's\
    \ parting gift,' compass appears in both, location transitions logically from\
    \ shop to forest edge."
