  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. Sarah considers recanting,
    going through official channels, and grapples with her internal conflict. The
    conversation with Marcus helps her solidify her decision for a 'third option'
    without him making the decision for her. All 'must not' items are avoided. The
    character voice is consistent, and the bridge to the next beat is clear and logical.
