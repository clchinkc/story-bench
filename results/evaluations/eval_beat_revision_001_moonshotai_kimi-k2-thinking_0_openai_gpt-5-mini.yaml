  evidence: 'The model addressed the correct flaw: it made the Ordeal an internal
    confrontation by having the dragon exploit Kira''s guilt over her brother, created
    a symbolic ''death'' (she drops her sword/accepts failure), and a rebirth/transformation
    (acceptance undoes the dragon; she gains purpose). Changes preserve setting, key
    lines, and outcome but add several new internal beats and exchanges—moderate rather
    than surgical edits.'
