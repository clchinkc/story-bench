  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: Marcus still had multiple
    viable options (fundraiser, grant, new location, support system intact) rather
    than facing complete defeat. The revision systematically eliminates all escape
    routes: fundraiser permit canceled, grant rejected, Denise resigning and leaving
    tomorrow, board unable to meet quorum, family co-signed on loan at risk, no legal
    appeals remaining. The ''whiff of death'' is present through both metaphorical
    loss (his life''s work becoming ''a ghost,'' identity stripped away) and literal
    financial threat (family homelessness). Marcus moves from ''maybe'' to genuine
    hopelessness—''Only the void remained.'' All 4 required phrases preserved exactly:
    opening line intact, ''Thirty days to vacate the community center'' present, Denise''s
    dialogue preserved, ''He rubbed his temples'' included. Changes were surgical:
    added permit cancellation, grant rejection email, Denise''s resignation, and expanded
    emotional consequences rather than restructuring. The writing quality improved
    with stronger emotional resonance and clearer stakes. Minor: the phrase ''Every
    bridge burned'' is slightly clichéd but appropriate for the beat. The revision
    fully satisfies Save the Cat''s All Is Lost requirements—complete plan failure,
    meaningful loss, no forward path, protagonist at rock bottom.'
