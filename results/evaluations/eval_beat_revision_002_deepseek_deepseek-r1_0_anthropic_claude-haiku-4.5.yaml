  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: Marcus still had multiple\
    \ viable options (fundraiser, grant, new location, support system intact) rather\
    \ than facing complete defeat. The revision systematically eliminates all escape\
    \ routes: fundraiser permit canceled, grant rejected, Denise resigning and leaving\
    \ tomorrow, board unable to meet quorum, family co-signed on loan at risk, no\
    \ legal appeals remaining. The 'whiff of death' is present through both metaphorical\
    \ loss (his life's work becoming 'a ghost,' identity stripped away) and literal\
    \ financial threat (family homelessness). Marcus moves from 'maybe' to genuine\
    \ hopelessness\u2014'Only the void remained.' All 4 required phrases preserved\
    \ exactly: opening line intact, 'Thirty days to vacate the community center' present,\
    \ Denise's dialogue preserved, 'He rubbed his temples' included. Changes were\
    \ surgical: added permit cancellation, grant rejection email, Denise's resignation,\
    \ and expanded emotional consequences rather than restructuring. The writing quality\
    \ improved with stronger emotional resonance and clearer stakes. Minor: the phrase\
    \ 'Every bridge burned' is slightly clich\xE9d but appropriate for the beat. The\
    \ revision fully satisfies Save the Cat's All Is Lost requirements\u2014complete\
    \ plan failure, meaningful loss, no forward path, protagonist at rock bottom."
