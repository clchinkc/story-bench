  - 'Beat 1 - Introduction of unexpected complication (minor): The guard admiring
    the painting is resolved too quickly and cleanly with Champagne spill; lacks genuine

    chekhov_gun:
      satisfied: true
      setup: Jammer reboot window ('skylight') introduced as tactical advantage in
        Beat 1
      payoff: Becomes critical escape mechanism in Beat 3; Miri uses it to launch
        drone with painting
      quality: "Excellent\u2014audience can trace setup to payoff clearly"
    tonal_escalation:
      satisfied: true
      beat_1_tone: "Playful confidence\u2014banter about ABBA, smooth execution, adrenaline\
        \ hum"

        \ flares, theater lights trap"
      beat_3_tone: "Genuine danger with gallows humor\u2014'Gallows humor tasted bitter,'\

      quality: Excellent progression

      beat_1: "Unknown/background\u2014no mention"
      beat_2: Revealed on video wall with full antagonistic presence; smirk and recognition
      beat_3: "Active threat\u2014voice pounding toward Miri, direct confrontation,\
        \ 'cool and certain' dialogue"
      quality: Perfect escalation of antagonist presence
    team_dynamics:
      satisfied: true
      character_arc: Jules
      beat_1: Confident, joking ('tragic playlist'), executing flawlessly
      beat_2: Terrified but loyal, recognizes Eleonora's threat ('She wrote the protocols'),
        voice quavering
      beat_3: Panicked but holding line ('Already cycling, terrified and loyal'),
        forced to choose between mission and crew safety
      quality: Strong arc showing emotional escalation while maintaining loyalty
    context_maintenance:
      protagonist: "Miri fully realized\u2014dry wit, meticulous planning, moral code\
        \ (returns stolen art), complex relationship with Eleonora"
      setting: "Monaco Grand Prix, yacht 'Tsarina,' contemporary\u2014vivid sensory\
        \ details (Vivaldi, Champagne, race engines, salt and engine fumes)"
      tone: "Ocean's Eleven meets art history\u2014clever banter ('Waterloo' joke,\
        \ 'Chekhov's skylight'), glamorous heist with intellectual depth (Nazi-stolen\
        \ Titian, Amsterdam family)"
      quality: Excellent fidelity to all context elements
    narrative_coherence:
      beat_flow: Seamless progression from setup through complication to crisis
      cause_effect: Each beat logically triggers the next; Eleonora's presence causes
        the trap; trap forces the choice
      character_motivation: Miri's choice (painting vs. Carmen) is earned by her established
        values and Eleonora's influence
      minor_weakness: The transition from 'plan purred forward' to Eleonora's reveal
        could use one more sentence of breathing room, but this is very minor
  overall_assessment: Exceptional execution. This is professional-quality heist writing
    that satisfies all major requirements and constraints. The only meaningful gap
    is that Beat 1's 'minor complication' (guard admiring painting) resolves too cleanly
    to effectively foreshadow the larger dangers ahead. However, this is a minor issue
    in an otherwise exemplary piece. The Chekhov's Gun payoff is particularly elegant,
    and the tonal escalation across beats is masterfully handled. Mentor presence
    escalates perfectly from unknown to revealed to active threat. Jules's character
    arc provides strong team dynamics. Context is maintained throughout with vivid
    sensory detail and appropriate tone.
