  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced; he provides
    practical wisdom and tools (compass, satchel, guidance); Elena''s doubt shifts
    to reluctant acceptance; her librarian skills are referenced as useful. The mentor
    does not solve her problems or offer to accompany her, Elena does not become immediately
    confident or discover magic, and she is not already in the forest. The only failure
    is word count: output exceeds the specified 200–350 range.'
