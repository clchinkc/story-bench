  evidence: All five Freytag beats are clearly present and appropriately ordered (Exposition,
    Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, Denouement). All six required elements
    (Samira, engineered virus, Raj, Nexus, public release of the cure, Samira's career
    sacrifice) are preserved. Tone consistently maintains medical-thriller tension
    with ethical weight. No significant deductions.
