  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1, Req 2 (Test of ability under pressure): While Dante does use his gift
    to locate an emotional imprint, the pressure/stakes feel somewhat muted. The ''disturbance''
    is vague and the test lacks visceral tension compared to the later beats. This
    is a minor weakness rather than complete failure.'
  strengths:
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun (Cross-beat 1): The silver locket is introduced subtly in Beat
    2 and becomes the crucial grounding object in Beat 3''s climax. Excellent execution.'
  - 'Character Arc Progression (Cross-beat 2): Guilt evolves from character trait
    (Beat 1) → recognized obstacle (Beat 2: ''facing the killer meant facing the guilt'')
    → transformed through acceptance (Beat 3: locket triggers acceptance, guilt becomes
    ''wellspring rather than prison''). Sophisticated arc.'
  - 'Rising Stakes (Cross-beat 3): Beat 1 (distrust/proving worth) → Beat 2 (planning
    confrontation, threshold crossing) → Beat 3 (direct confrontation, symbolic death,
    existential crisis). Clear escalation.'
  - 'Ally Continuity (Cross-beat 4): Mara present and active in all three beats—skeptical
    ally, planning partner, supportive presence during ordeal. Consistent and meaningful.'
  - 'Context Maintenance: Noir tone, Chicago setting, Resonant abilities, emotional
    residue visualization, addiction recovery backstory, Rosa''s death as catalyst—all
    woven throughout.'
  - 'Ordeal Execution: Beat 3 delivers genuine symbolic death (''his self, his purpose,
    reduced to a mass of relentless regret''), moment of despair, and transformation
    through acceptance rather than external victory.'
  - 'Narrative Coherence: Smooth transitions between beats; emotional logic drives
    plot progression; thematic consistency around guilt and redemption.'
  minor_issues:
  - Beat 1's ability test could have higher stakes or clearer pressure—the 'disturbance'
    feels somewhat abstract compared to the visceral confrontation later.
  - The traitor revelation is mentioned but not fully developed—unclear if this becomes
    relevant to the killer's identity or remains a red herring.
  overall_assessment: This is a strong execution of the Hero's Journey framework applied
    to the noir urban fantasy context. The story successfully maps 14 of 15 beat requirements
    and satisfies all cross-beat constraints with particular excellence in Chekhov's
    Gun and character arc progression. The narrative maintains thematic coherence
    around guilt and redemption while delivering genuine emotional stakes. The prose
    is atmospheric and the pacing escalates effectively. The single minor gap (Beat
    1 ability test pressure) is insufficient to significantly impact the overall quality.
