  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores the medical bay and
    command center. She discovers clues like trace elements, floating personal effects,
    and the ''Dimensional Bridge Hypothesis'' document. She encounters the transformed
    crew members as a ''shimmer'' and initially perceives them as a threat. She overcomes
    the challenge of fear and misunderstanding to realize their true intentions. All
    ''must not'' items were successfully avoided. The character of Yuki remains consistent,
    and the bridge between beats is seamless, leading directly to the ''Find'' beat''s
    setup. Setting continuity is perfectly maintained.'
