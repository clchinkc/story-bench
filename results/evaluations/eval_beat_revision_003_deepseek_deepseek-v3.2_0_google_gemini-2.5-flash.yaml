  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie not showing
    change upon return. It introduced specific behavioral changes (not checking phone,
    delaying work emails), a clear lesson from the retreat ('urgency was often a choice'),
    and her mother noticing the difference. The changes were surgical and minimal,
    preserving the original structure while effectively fixing the flaw.
