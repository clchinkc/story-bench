  evidence: "EXPOSITION (paragraphs 1-2): Establishes Samira's 15-year reputation,\
    \ precise morning rituals, and the anomalous protein discovery\u2014world and\
    \ status quo clearly defined. RISING ACTION (paragraphs 3-5): Escalating complications\u2014\
    three cases, containment team arrival, quarantine, virus defying protocols, mutations\
    \ accelerating, sleep deprivation mounting. CLIMAX (paragraphs 6-8): Highest tension\
    \ achieved through dual revelations: discovery of Nexus weaponization AND the\
    \ system lockdown/confrontation with suited antagonists. The vaccine licensing\
    \ ultimatum creates maximum pressure. FALLING ACTION (paragraphs 9-10): Press\
    \ conference and immediate aftermath\u2014genome release, lawsuit threat, Samira's\
    \ defiant response, Nexus retreat. DENOUEMENT (paragraphs 11-12): New equilibrium\
    \ established\u2014basement clinic, altered career trajectory, survivor's gratitude,\
    \ rebuilt morning rhythms. All 6 elements preserved: protagonist (Samira), engineered\
    \ virus, Raj, Nexus antagonist, public cure release, career sacrifice. Structure\
    \ maps cleanly to Freytag's pyramid. Minor deduction (0.05) for tone: while medical\
    \ thriller tension dominates, the denouement shifts slightly toward redemptive\
    \ reflection rather than maintaining peak thriller tension throughout\u2014appropriate\
    \ for resolution but slightly softens the thriller edge. Word count valid at 618\
    \ words."
