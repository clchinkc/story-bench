  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' and revised it to demonstrate Rachel's traits through action
    and interaction. It shows her dedication to cold cases, her relationship with
    James through dialogue, and introduces the setting through sensory details. The
    changes were not minimal; it was a complete rewrite of the exposition, but it
    effectively fixed the identified flaw. The phrase 'Detective Rachel Torres' was
    not used, only 'Rachel Torres'. 'Detective James Oyelaran' was shortened to 'James'.
