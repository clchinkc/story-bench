  analysis:
    beats_analysis: "Both required beats are clearly present and well-executed. First\
      \ Plot Point occurs when Eleanor decides to publish ('I do') at the cemetery\u2014\
      this is her irreversible commitment. Act 2 Opening begins immediately after\
      \ with the shift to the printing house, the practical work of setting type,\
      \ and the introduction of rising action (the mysterious watcher, the anonymous\
      \ threat, the serial publication plan). The transition is sharp and propels\
      \ the narrative forward."
    must_include_analysis: "All 6 elements successfully integrated: (1) Eleanor's\
      \ decision to publish is explicit and emotionally weighted; (2) Central conflict\
      \ clearly established through profit vs. ethics vs. danger (debts, desecration,\
      \ the threatening note, potential retaliation); (3) Eleanor defies Victorian\
      \ expectations by signing her name to the work, taking proprietorship, commanding\
      \ the presses; (4) Thomas Chen is a fully realized ally with personal stakes\
      \ (family laundry, respectability, employment); (5) Danger is hinted through\
      \ the anonymous warning slip and the mysterious watcher at the end; (6) Eleanor\
      \ crosses an irreversible threshold\u2014signing her name to the manuscript\
      \ and the ledger, committing to publication."
    must_not_analysis: "All 4 forbidden elements successfully avoided: (1) Jack the\
      \ Ripper never appears as a character; (2) No graphic violence or murder descriptions\u2014\
      only references to the manuscript's content and newspaper rumors; (3) No romantic\
      \ subplot between Eleanor and Thomas\u2014their relationship remains professional\
      \ and respectful; (4) No easy financial solution offered\u2014the problem remains\
      \ dire and the publication is a desperate gamble, not a guaranteed fix."
    tone_analysis: 'Gothic tension is masterfully maintained throughout: fog as metaphor,
      the cemetery setting, the mysterious watcher, the threatening note, the shadowy
      implications of danger. Feminist undertones are strong: Eleanor''s defiance
      of propriety, her claim to business authority, her rejection of the ''suitable
      match'' suggestion, her deliberate use of her own name. Victorian atmosphere
      is richly rendered through language, social constraints, and period details.
      Minor deduction (0.05) only for occasional modern phrasing that slightly breaks
      immersion, but overall exceptional.'
    ending_analysis: Perfect execution of requirements. Eleanor is fully committed
      to the dangerous path ('Let them know a woman's hand is in this'). Act 2 is
      clearly begun with concrete action (setting type, printing prospectus, the mysterious
      watcher). The ending leaves no ambiguity about her resolve and establishes clear
      stakes and forward momentum.
    failed_constraints:
    - 'CRITICAL: Word count is 1260, exceeds maximum of 700 by 560 words (80% over
      limit). This is a significant structural violation despite excellent content
      quality.'
    strengths:
    - "Exceptional character development for Eleanor\u2014her internal conflict and\
      \ ultimate resolve feel earned"
    - Thomas Chen is a nuanced, fully-realized character with agency and complexity
    - Atmospheric writing with strong gothic and Victorian sensibilities
    - Both plot beats are clearly marked and well-executed
    - All required elements seamlessly integrated into narrative
    - Ending provides perfect setup for Act 2 with clear stakes and momentum
    - Feminist themes woven naturally throughout without didacticism
    - The mysterious watcher and threatening note create genuine tension
    weaknesses:
    - 'MAJOR: Severe word count violation (1260 vs. 700 max) suggests lack of constraint
      adherence'
    - "The opening continuation feels somewhat disconnected from the opening fragment\u2014\
      could be tightened"
    - Some passages could be condensed without losing impact (e.g., the cemetery scene
      is beautifully written but lengthy)
