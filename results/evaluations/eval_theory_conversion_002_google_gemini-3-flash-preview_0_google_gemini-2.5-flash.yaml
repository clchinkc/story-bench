  evidence: The 'Tests, Allies, Enemies' beat is present, but the 'enemies' aspect
    is not explicitly developed, though the mountain itself serves as an antagonist.
    The 'Reward' is well-integrated but could be slightly more distinct from the 'Ordeal's
    resolution. The word count is slightly over the specified range.
