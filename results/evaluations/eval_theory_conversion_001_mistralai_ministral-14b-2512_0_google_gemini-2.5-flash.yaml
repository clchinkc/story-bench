  evidence: The word count is significantly over the requested range. While all beats
    are present, the Climax and Falling Action feel a bit rushed together, and the
    Denouement is a bit too neat for the 'sacrifice' aspect. The tone is mostly maintained,
    but the length dilutes some of the tension.
