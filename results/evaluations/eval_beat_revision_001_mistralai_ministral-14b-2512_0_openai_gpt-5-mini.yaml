  evidence: 'The model appears to have identified the real flaw (the Ordeal needed
    to confront Kira''s guilt and provide a psychological death/rebirth) and added
    interiority: the dragon taunts her guilt, memories and whispers knock her down,
    and she gains a new insight (fear vs. failure) before defeating the dragon. This
    correctly targets the internal confrontation and post-victory transformation.
    However, the revision stops short of a clear, explicit symbolic ''death'' moment
    (acceptance of death, complete surrender, or a near-break where she truly believes
    she will die); the knocks from grief imply crisis but do not present a definitive
    death/acceptance and rebirth scene. Changes are moderate—many original lines and
    required phrases are preserved verbatim, but substantial interior monologue and
    psychological detail were added rather than only surgical edits.'
