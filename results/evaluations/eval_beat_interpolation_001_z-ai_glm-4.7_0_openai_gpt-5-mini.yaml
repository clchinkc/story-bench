  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he provides practical wisdom and tools (satchel, brass compass, advice about research);
    Elena''s doubt shifts toward reluctant acceptance (''I guess... I can always organize
    the chaos''); her librarian skills are explicitly framed as useful. No prohibited
    elements appear (no sudden confidence, no mentor accompaniment/solving of problems,
    not set in/near the forest, no revelation of magical powers). Character voices
    and continuity between beats are consistent.'
