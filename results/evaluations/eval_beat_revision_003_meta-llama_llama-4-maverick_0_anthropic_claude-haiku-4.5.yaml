  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation\
    \ and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.\
    \ The revision fixes this precisely by: (1) Sophie putting phone away instead\
    \ of scrolling emails\u2014behavioral marker of change; (2) Explicitly stating\
    \ 'Linda needs me to call her tonight, but it can wait'\u2014direct contrast to\
    \ original 'already typing a response'; (3) Mother observing 'That's a change'\u2014\
    external validation of transformation; (4) Sophie articulating the insight: 'everything\
    \ will be there tomorrow...won't collapse if I don't respond right away'\u2014\
    specific lesson from retreat applied; (5) Final paragraph showing new perception:\
    \ 'noticing the way the streetlights cast a warm glow...a detail she never used\
    \ to see'\u2014metaphorical evidence of seeing world with new eyes. All 4 required\
    \ phrases preserved exactly: 'Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare', 'How was Thailand?\
    \ her mother asked', 'The familiar Chicago skyline appeared', 'It's good to be\
    \ home, she said'. Changes were surgical: kept original structure, setting, characters,\
    \ and work pressure element intact while inserting transformation markers. Only\
    \ additions were: phone-putting-away action, mother's observation, Sophie's insight\
    \ dialogue, and final perception paragraph. No deletions of core content. The\
    \ revision fully executes the Return (Having Changed) beat by demonstrating integrated\
    \ learning and behavioral shift rather than mere physical return."
