      score: 0.95
      satisfied:
      - 'Planning scene: Vera''s hidden room with photographs, red string connections,
        strategy discussion'

        heart,'' air growing thick with colors'

      - 'Direct confrontation: Killer revealed in basement, stolen colors surrounding
        him'

        guilt shatters, sees clearly'
      - 'Victory through understanding: Dante releases captured colors by touching

      notes: All five requirements satisfied; transformation is earned and emotionally

    chekhov_gun:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      analysis: Rosa's photograph with 'Brothers' written on back (introduced Beat
        1) becomes essential in Beat 3. The photograph reveals the killer's identity
        as the clinic founder, explaining his motivation and connection to Sofia.
        This detail transforms understanding of the entire conflict and enables Dante's
        victory through knowledge.
    character_arc_progression:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      beat_1: 'Guilt mentioned: ''familiar coil of guilt settle in his stomach,''
        reference to Sofia''s death'
      beat_2: 'Guilt recognized as obstacle: Vera explicitly states ''guilt like a
        second skin...blocking your gift''; Dante acknowledges it'
      beat_3: 'Guilt transformed: Dante accesses Sofia''s final thought of beauty,
        guilt ''crystallized into something sharp'' then ''shattered''; he chooses
        to carry memory as promise rather than burden'
      analysis: Arc is complete and psychologically coherent across all beats
    rising_stakes:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      beat_1_stakes: Dante must prove himself to gain ally; traitor exists within
        community
      beat_2_stakes: Walking into confirmed trap; killer actively hunting; Dante realizes
        he's the target
      beat_3_stakes: Direct confrontation with killer; Vera's life at risk; Dante's
        entire identity threatened; revelation about sister's death
      analysis: Stakes escalate logically and dramatically across all three beats
    ally_continuity:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      beat_1: Vera introduced, distrusts Dante, gradually accepts him
      beat_2: Vera present in planning, sharpens blade, commits to descent together
      beat_3: Vera frozen by killer but essential to final resolution; Dante's actions
        free her; she witnesses transformation
      analysis: Vera remains present and narratively relevant throughout; her arc
        parallels Dante's
    context_maintenance:
      score: 0.95
      analysis: 'Protagonist (Dante Reyes) fully realized with addiction recovery
        arc; Setting (Buckingham Hotel, Chicago underworld) vividly rendered; Tone
        (noir-tinged, melancholic, redemptive) consistently maintained; Resonant abilities
        system clearly established; only minor: could have emphasized Chicago setting
        more explicitly'
    narrative_coherence:
      score: 0.92
      analysis: 'Beats flow naturally from discovery to planning to confrontation;
        emotional logic is strong; character motivations clear; minor issues: killer''s
        motivation could be slightly clearer earlier; pacing in Beat 3 is dense but
        effective'
    critical_issues:
    - issue: Word count violation
      severity: HIGH
      details: Story is 1663 words vs. 700-1000 maximum. Exceeds limit by 663 words
        (66% over). This is a hard constraint violation.
      impact: Disqualifies story from meeting technical requirements despite excellent
        narrative quality
    strengths:
    - Exceptional character development with genuine emotional depth
    - Sophisticated integration of Campbell's monomyth structure
    - Chekhov's Gun executed with elegance (photograph payoff)
    - Character arc transformation feels earned, not imposed
    - Noir tone consistently maintained with vivid sensory language
    - All cross-beat constraints satisfied perfectly
    - Ally relationship develops organically with mutual respect
    - 'Thematic coherence: guilt, redemption, choice, beauty'
    weaknesses:
    - Significant word count overage (66% above maximum)
    - Could trim exposition in Beat 2 planning sequence
    - Killer's backstory/motivation could be slightly more explicit earlier
    - Some redundancy in guilt references (though thematically intentional)
  recommendation: 'STRONG NARRATIVE WITH TECHNICAL VIOLATION. The story demonstrates
    exceptional craft: all 15 beat requirements satisfied (93%), all 4 cross-beat
    constraints satisfied (100%), excellent context maintenance (0.95), and strong
    coherence (0.92). The character arc is psychologically sophisticated, the Chekhov''s
    Gun is elegantly executed, and stakes rise effectively. However, the word count
    violation (1663 vs. 1000 max) is a hard constraint failure that cannot be overlooked.
    With editing to reduce by ~700 words (primarily in Beat 2 planning and Beat 3
    confrontation), this would be exceptional work. Current form: 0.93 quality undermined
    by 0.0 technical compliance on word count.'
