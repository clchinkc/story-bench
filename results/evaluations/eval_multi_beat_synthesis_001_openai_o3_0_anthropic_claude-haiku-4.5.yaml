  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1, Req 4 (Dante must prove himself to gain ally): Dante proves his ability
    to Marisol through reading the mirror, but the ''proof'' moment is somewhat brief
    and could be more dramatically weighted as a formal test/trial. Marisol''s acceptance
    (''All right, painter. You''re in'') is earned but feels slightly understated
    as a full character arc beat.'
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional Chekhov''s Gun execution: Rosa''s Zippo introduced in Beat 1 as a
    symbolic gift becomes the literal tool that transforms Dante''s guilt (teal to
    green) and destroys the crucible in Beat 3. Multi-layered brilliance.'
  - "Character arc progression is masterful: Beat 1 (guilt mentioned via Celia's diary\
    \ cover), Beat 2 (guilt recognized as obstacle\u2014'nothing filters what's already\
    \ inside'), Beat 3 (guilt transformed from self-hatred to sorrow). Precise emotional\
    \ trajectory."
  - 'Rising stakes perfectly calibrated: Beat 1 (mentor dead, traitor revealed), Beat
    2 (multiple victims, basement infiltration planned), Beat 3 (direct confrontation
    with killer, Dante''s own abilities targeted, crucible threatening to drain him
    completely).'
  - "Ally continuity flawless: Marisol present and essential in all three beats\u2014\
    introduces test, plans strategy, provides tactical support during ordeal."
  - 'Context maintenance excellent: Noir tone sustained throughout; Chicago setting
    vivid; Resonant abilities integrated naturally; addiction recovery theme woven
    into every beat without didacticism.'
  - 'Symbolic death in Ordeal is visceral: ''his own guilt surged, hurricane-bright,
    drowning the room in savage teal. He heard Celia coughing...he was already dead.''
    Psychological death before physical confrontation.'
  - 'Transformation through understanding: Victory achieved not through combat prowess
    but through Dante''s acceptance that ''flame doesn''t erase the past; it reveals
    what''s beneath the smoke.'' Thematic coherence.'
  - 'Prose quality: Sensory details (dust, bruised purples, wet asphalt eyes, burnt
    sugar and vomit) create immersive noir atmosphere. Metaphors (residue as graffiti,
    colors as emotions) reinforce magic system.'
  minor_weaknesses:
  - 'Beat 1, Req 4 slightly underdeveloped: The mirror-reading test is effective but
    could have included more explicit resistance from Marisol before acceptance, making
    the ''proof'' moment more dramatically earned.'
  - 'Lucas Grey''s characterization: While functional as traitor/predator, his motivation
    remains somewhat opaque. A single line of dialogue explaining his corruption would
    strengthen the enemy revelation.'
  - 'Pacing in Beat 2: The planning sequence is efficient but slightly compressed.
    One additional sensory detail or moment of hesitation could deepen the ''doubt
    before proceeding'' requirement.'
  calibration_notes: "This story executes the Hero's Journey framework with sophisticated\
    \ integration of all constraints. The Chekhov's Gun element is particularly strong\u2014\
    the Zippo functions as both emotional symbol and literal plot device. Character\
    \ arc progression is precise and earned. All cross-beat constraints are satisfied\
    \ at high quality. The only minor gap is that Dante's 'proof' to Marisol, while\
    \ clear, could be slightly more dramatically weighted as a formal trial. Context\
    \ and coherence are both excellent. This represents strong professional-quality\
    \ work that fully satisfies requirements with only negligible gaps."
