  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World - opening pottery life, (2)
    Call to Adventure - dry spring/elders'' request, (3) Refusal of Call - explicit
    three-day refusal, (4) Meeting the Mentor - grandmother''s shawl/memory as guide,
    (5) Crossing Threshold - dawn departure on three-day journey, (6) Tests - rockslides,
    cold, doubt explicitly named, (7) Allies - shepherd, stream, hawk, (8) Enemies
    - doubt/internal resistance, (9) Approach to Inmost Cave - arrival at shrine ruins,
    (10) Ordeal - despair at ruins, finding journal, (11) Reward - creating new vessel
    at dawn, (12) Road Back - journey home with vessel. MISSING/WEAK: ''Resurrection''
    beat (final confrontation with old self) is implied but not distinctly staged
    as separate from Reward. The ''Return with Elixir'' conflates with Resurrection
    rather than being its own beat. PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact - Maya protagonist,
    pottery central, grandmother''s legacy (journal/shawl/teachings), mountain shrine,
    dried spring problem, surrender theme (''Let the clay speak,'' ''Your hands are
    not the sculptor''), transformation arc complete. STRUCTURE: Follows monomyth
    sequence logically with clear progression. Minor issue: Resurrection and Return
    with Elixir could be more distinctly separated (currently merged in final village
    scene). TONE: Consistently quiet, meditative, introspective. Language choices
    (''stones on her chest,'' ''despair closing around her throat,'' ''bled across
    the sky'') maintain lyrical, contemplative register throughout. Word count: 707
    words (valid range 600-800).'
