  evidence: All 5 target beats are clearly present and well-defined. Exposition sets
    up Samira's world and the initial discovery. Rising Action details the escalating
    outbreak and her investigation into Nexus. Climax is the confrontation at Nexus
    and the decision to release the cure. Falling Action covers the immediate aftermath
    of the press conference and the containment of the virus. Denouement shows Samira's
    new life and the long-term consequences. All 6 core elements are preserved. The
    word count is within the valid range. The tone of a medical thriller with ethical
    weight is consistently maintained throughout the narrative.
