  evidence: The model made revisions to the original segment, indicating it did not
    recognize it as a well-executed beat. It changed several phrases and added a new
    paragraph at the end, suggesting it believed the original was flawed or incomplete.
    For example, 'The gallery had officially closed its doors that morning' became
    'The gallery had closed this morning.' and 'let the silence swa' became 'sat in
    the silence. Outside, the city kept moving—cars, sirens, life continuing. But
    here, time had stopped. No calls left to make. No plans. Just the weight of loss
    pressing down on her chest. Tomorrow she'd figure out what comes next. Tonight,
    she let herself break.'
