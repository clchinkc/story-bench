  evidence: "All 4 required elements present: (1) Multiple area exploration\u2014\
    medical bay, crew quarters, corridors, Lab Seven approach; (2) Clue discovery\u2014\
    holo-log of Dr. Anders discussing molecular phase shift; (3) Mysterious encounter\u2014\
    shimmering presences, whispers, flickering faces in mirror; (4) Obstacle overcome\u2014\
    locked door requiring scanner recalibration. All must-not violations avoided:\
    \ data core not immediately found (only located at end), crew doesn't explain\
    \ everything (only cryptic whispers and Commander's brief guidance), mission continues,\
    \ Yuki doesn't know about dimensional transformation beforehand. Character voice\
    \ remains consistent\u2014scientific curiosity, caution, growing dread. Bridge\
    \ seamless: BEFORE ends with her arrival and silence; GENERATED shows active investigation\
    \ and discovery; AFTER reveals the payoff. Setting continuity perfect: same station,\
    \ same crew mystery, logical progression through spaces. Execution exemplifies\
    \ the Search beat\u2014struggle, adaptation, incremental progress toward understanding\
    \ without resolution."
