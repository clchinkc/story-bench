  evidence: 'The revision explicitly addresses the actual flaw: the dragon taunts
    Kira about her brother''s death (confronting her deepest fear), she experiences
    a symbolic ''death'' moment when darkness and guilt consume her, then a clear
    rebirth/transformation occurs (forgiveness, inner clarity, sword glowing), and
    her victory stems from this new understanding rather than mere persistence. The
    model preserved all four required elements and exact required phrases while expanding
    internal psychological material; changes were moderate (kept core sentences and
    structure but added substantial interiority and the death/rebirth sequence). A
    minor grammatical issue remains (''a earth-shaking roar''), but no major new errors
    introduced.'
