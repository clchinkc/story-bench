  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Multiple
    station areas explored (crew quarters, medical bay, corridor, Lab Seven); (2)
    Clues discovered progressively (overturned chairs, personal logs, phase-shift
    trials, biobeds, equations on whiteboards); (3) Transformed crew encountered mysteriously
    (shimmer figures, fragmented whispers, flickering humanoids—identity unclear);
    (4) Obstacle overcome (coolant leak, emergency bulkheads, rewiring circuits under
    pressure). The Search beat functions authentically—Yuki actively adapts, struggles,
    and makes incremental discoveries rather than immediately understanding. All must-not
    violations avoided: she doesn''t find the core yet (only locates Lab Seven), crew
    doesn''t explain everything (only whispers), she commits to mission, and she arrives
    without prior knowledge. Character voice remains consistent—scientific, methodical,
    increasingly unsettled. Seamless bridge from BEFORE (arrival/mystery) to GENERATED
    (exploration/discovery) to AFTER (core location/revelation). Setting continuity
    perfect—same station, escalating stakes, logical progression through spaces. MINOR
    DEDUCTION: Word count 249 falls 1 word short of 250-400 range, technically invalid
    per specifications, though negligible impact on narrative quality.'
  overall_assessment: Exceptional execution of the Search beat with only a trivial
    word count shortfall
error: null
