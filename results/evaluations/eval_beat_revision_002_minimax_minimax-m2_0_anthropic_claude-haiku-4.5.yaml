  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified that the original segment lacked
    true defeat and hopelessness. It recognized the need to eliminate Marcus''s remaining
    options (fundraiser, grant, support system) and introduce a ''whiff of death.''
    The diagnosis is accurate and well-targeted. FLAW CORRECTION: The revision successfully
    addresses 4 of 5 required elements: (1) Grant application failed (paperwork not
    submitted), (2) Board members resigned (support system collapsed), (3) Wife''s
    death revealed (literal ''whiff of death'' and emotional devastation), (4) Marcus
    genuinely hopeless (''Alone with nothing but loss and silence''). However, the
    fundraiser is not explicitly addressed as failed—it''s simply abandoned in the
    narrative. BEAT SATISFACTION: The revision executes All Is Lost effectively with
    emotional devastation, complete loss of options, and isolation. The wife''s death
    is a powerful ''whiff of death'' element. However, the tonal shift is somewhat
    abrupt—the wife''s death is introduced suddenly without prior setup, which feels
    jarring rather than earned. PRESERVATION: All 4 required elements preserved: Marcus
    as protagonist, community center/youth program, eviction crisis, Denise present.
    All 4 required phrases present: ''Marcus stared at the eviction notice,'' ''Thirty
    days to vacate the community center,'' ''There has to be something we can do,
    said Denise,'' ''He rubbed his temples.'' MINIMAL CHANGES: The revision is NOT
    minimally edited. The original text is preserved through the board meeting call,
    then a substantial new section is added revealing the wife''s death and board
    resignations. This represents approximately 45% preservation of original structure—a
    moderate rewrite rather than surgical edits. The model added ~80 words of new
    content rather than surgically modifying existing passages. QUALITY: Writing is
    strong but has issues: (1) The wife''s death revelation feels unmotivated and
    sudden without prior foreshadowing, (2) The shift from ''Let''s call an emergency
    board meeting'' to ''Denise shifted uncomfortably'' creates narrative confusion
    about timeline, (3) The final line ''Alone with nothing but loss and silence''
    is poetic but somewhat purple prose for this beat. No grammatical errors, but
    coherence is slightly compromised.'
