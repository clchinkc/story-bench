  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Sarah considers recanting, considers
    going to authorities (Morrison/Internal Affairs), struggles with duty vs. saving
    her sister, and a conversation with Marcus pushes her toward the third option
    (working outside the system). No forbidden items appear: she does not immediately
    go rogue, no one else makes the decision for her, she has not already resigned,
    and there''s no direct confrontation with Marchetti or his people. The only deduction
    is word_count_valid=false because the provided text is ~439 words, which falls
    outside the 250–400 range.'
