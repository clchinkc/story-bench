  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Marcus is introduced, he provides
    tools (satchel, compass, scroll) and wisdom, Elena''s doubt shifts (''The compass
    trembled in her grip, then steadied''), and her librarian skills are referenced
    as useful. All ''must not'' items are avoided. The character of Elena remains
    consistent, and Marcus''s character is well-established as a wise mentor. The
    bridge from ''Refusal'' to ''Meeting the Mentor'' is smooth, with Elena seeking
    out the shop after her refusal. Continuity is maintained throughout.'
