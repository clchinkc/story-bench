  evidence: "All four required elements are present (considering recanting, considering\
    \ authorities, internal duty-vs-sister conflict, and a tipping moment/conversation).\
    \ The piece functions clearly as the Debate beat\u2014Sarah weighs options, seeks\
    \ advice, and ultimately commits to a course of action at the end. None of the\
    \ forbidden elements appear (no immediate rogue decision, no one else makes the\
    \ decision, she has not resigned yet, and there's no direct confrontation with\
    \ Marchetti). Character voice and setting remain consistent with the preceding\
    \ scene, so no deductions were necessary."
