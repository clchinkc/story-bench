  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The 'Search' beat's
    narrative function is clearly fulfilled as Yuki actively explores, gathers clues,
    faces an obstacle (the transformed crew), and adapts to continue her mission.
    All 'must not' items were successfully avoided. Character behavior and setting
    continuity are consistent. The bridge to the next beat is seamless, setting up
    the discovery of the data core.
