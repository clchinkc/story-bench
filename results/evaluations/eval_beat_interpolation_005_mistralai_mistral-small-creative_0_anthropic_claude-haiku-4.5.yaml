  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently.
    (1) Alejandro''s vulnerability about the accident, his father, and his mother''s
    cooking is deeply revealed. (2) Relationship shifts from professional distance
    (Lucia delivering meals, avoidance) to genuine personal connection. (3) The candlelit
    moment with hand-holding and emotional confession creates authentic connection
    without premature intimacy. (4) Maya''s choice to stay ''for the man'' rather
    than ''the money'' represents clear commitment deepening beyond contract. The
    beat perfectly executes the narrative function: Alejandro lowers his walls, Maya
    responds with compassion, and both are emotionally committed now. MUST-NOT ITEMS:
    All avoided. They are not in love yet (connection is nascent). Maya doesn''t decide
    to leave or breach contract. The photograph isn''t taken during this scene. Alejandro
    does lower his walls significantly. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Both characters remain
    true to established personas—Maya''s empathy and Alejandro''s guarded pain are
    consistent with BEFORE. BRIDGE: Seamless connection between BEFORE (contract signed,
    stakes established) and AFTER (photograph scandal, expulsion). This midpoint explains
    why they''re on the balcony together later. CONTINUITY: Storm, power outage, candles,
    kitchen setting all internally consistent. ONLY DEDUCTION: Word count exceeds
    range (632 vs 300-450 max), which is a technical violation but doesn''t affect
    narrative quality.'
