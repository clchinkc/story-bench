  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model partially identified the flaw but incompletely.\
    \ It recognized the need for emotional devastation and removed hope, but FAILED\
    \ to address the core structural requirements: (1) No concrete failure of specific\
    \ plans\u2014fundraiser and grant are still vague/mentioned but never explicitly\
    \ rejected; (2) No clear 'whiff of death'\u2014the loss is metaphorical (purpose/identity)\
    \ but lacks the visceral impact of actual rejection or betrayal; (3) Denise's\
    \ abandonment is implied but underdeveloped\u2014she 'turns away' but no explicit\
    \ betrayal or isolation moment; (4) The revision adds despair tone but doesn't\
    \ show the MECHANISM of defeat (grant rejection letter, fundraiser cancellation,\
    \ etc.). FLAW CORRECTION: Partial. The revision successfully strips away Marcus's\
    \ fighting spirit and hope, achieving emotional devastation. However, it fails\
    \ to show WHAT specifically failed\u2014the grant application is called 'a cruel\
    \ fantasy' but never explicitly rejected. The fundraiser is mentioned but never\
    \ fails. This is atmospheric despair rather than structural All Is Lost. PRESERVATION:\
    \ All 4 required phrases present (eviction notice, thirty days, Denise dialogue,\
    \ rubbed temples). All 4 story elements preserved (Marcus, community center, eviction,\
    \ Denise). MINIMAL CHANGE: Moderate rewrite (0.6). The model expanded the segment\
    \ significantly with new introspective passages ('despair coiling tightly,' 'wreckage\
    \ of his efforts,' 'barren halls') rather than surgically editing the original.\
    \ Structure was reorganized; new emotional beats added. QUALITY: Good prose quality\
    \ (0.7)\u2014vivid imagery and emotional resonance\u2014but introduces some purple\
    \ prose ('smoke,' 'echoes of shattered dreams') that borders on overwrought. No\
    \ grammatical errors. The revision reads well but represents a 40% expansion rather\
    \ than minimal surgical edits."
