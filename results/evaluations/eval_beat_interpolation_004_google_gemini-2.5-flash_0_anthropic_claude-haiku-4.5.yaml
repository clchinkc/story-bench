  evidence: "REQUIRED ELEMENTS (4/4 present): (1) Direct examination of Dr. Okonkwo\u2014\
    Thomas systematically questions her about her position, knowledge of adverse reactions,\
    \ and documentation. (2) Near-recant moment\u2014'Her lips parted, and it seemed\
    \ she was about to utter a retraction, a carefully worded denial that would unravel\
    \ everything.' This is explicitly articulated. (3) Thomas's decisive action\u2014\
    He chooses not to interrupt, takes a deliberate breath, and delivers a carefully\
    \ crafted appeal to her professional integrity and humanity ('You are a scientist.\
    \ A healer. You know the cost of silence.'). This directly influences her decision.\
    \ (4) Turning point where truth prevails\u2014Dr. Okonkwo's 'Yes' and revelation\
    \ of the seventeen deaths and suppressed reports represents the irrevocable turning\
    \ point. MUST-NOT ITEMS (0/4 violations): Avoided simple truth-telling without\
    \ struggle; Thomas actively influences outcome rather than remaining passive;\
    \ defense does not win; no external deus ex machina. EXECUTION: The climax perfectly\
    \ executes Freytag's function\u2014highest tension, protagonist takes decisive\
    \ action, central conflict peaks, outcome is determined. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY:\
    \ Thomas's voice remains steady and strategic; Dr. Okonkwo's internal conflict\
    \ is psychologically authentic; Judge Wright's silent presence maintains established\
    \ characterization. BRIDGE: Seamless transition from Rising Action (setup of the\
    \ decisive moment) to Falling Action (consequences unfold). CONTINUITY: Courtroom\
    \ setting maintained; character positions consistent; emotional stakes align with\
    \ prior narrative."
