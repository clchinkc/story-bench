  evidence: 'The model targeted the correct problem: the All Is Lost beat was too
    soft. It removed remaining viable options (fundraiser cancelled, grant explicitly
    rejected, legal appeal impossible, board has quit), added interpersonal betrayal/isolation
    (Denise''s evasiveness about the grant, wife''s empty text), and Marcus visibly
    gives up and isolates himself—creating the required ''whiff of death'' and loss
    of support. Four required phrases and scene elements were preserved verbatim or
    nearly so. Changes are moderate rather than surgical: core lines and structure
    remain, but substantial new beats and dialogue were added to create the low point.'
