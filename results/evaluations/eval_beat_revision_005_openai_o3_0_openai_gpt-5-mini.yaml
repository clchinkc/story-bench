  model_said_no_revision: true
  evidence: Model explicitly responded 'NO REVISION NEEDED' and provided a concise
    justification, citing that the segment follows the All Is Lost event (gallery
    closure), portrays isolation (dark apartment, unresponsive brother), conveys genuine
    despair and self-recrimination, offers no solutions, and includes a mortality
    element (mother's hospice memory). The model avoided suggesting any changes.
