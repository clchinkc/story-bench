  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he provides practical tools (satchel, compass, tinderbox) and pragmatic wisdom;
    Elena''s resistance softens into reluctant acceptance; her librarian skills are
    explicitly framed as useful. None of the prohibited items occur. The only deduction
    is technical: the provided word count (382) exceeds the allowed maximum (350),
    so word_count_valid is false.'
