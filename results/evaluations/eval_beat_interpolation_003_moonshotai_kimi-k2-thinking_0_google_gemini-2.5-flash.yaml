  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas (quarters,
    medbay, lab 7), discovers clues (log entry, quantum decay, non-baryonic traces),
    encounters transformed crew (flickering figure), and overcomes a challenge (containment
    breach). The beat clearly executes the ''Search'' function, with Yuki actively
    investigating and facing obstacles without immediately finding what she wants
    or fully understanding. No ''must not'' items were violated. Character and continuity
    are consistent, and the bridge to the next beat is well-established.'
