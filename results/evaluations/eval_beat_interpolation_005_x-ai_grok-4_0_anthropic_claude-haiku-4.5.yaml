  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Maya
    discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability through his confession about injury, betrayal,
    and emotional isolation; (2) relationship shifts from professional (silent meals,
    distance) to personal (hand-brushing, shared cooking, emotional honesty); (3)
    shared moment of genuine connection via paella preparation and physical/emotional
    intimacy without crossing into ''already in love''; (4) Maya makes explicit commitment
    choice (''she knew she''d stay, not for the salary, but for the man''). The beat
    perfectly executes Act 2 Midpoint function—raises stakes, shifts Maya from reactive
    (just surviving contract) to proactive (choosing to stay for emotional reasons),
    represents point of no return in her journey. All must-not items avoided: they''re
    not already in love (connection is tentative/fragile), Maya doesn''t decide to
    leave, photograph isn''t taken during scene, Alejandro''s walls genuinely lower
    (crack in armor, vulnerability spills out). Character voices consistent—Maya''s
    steadiness and empathy, Alejandro''s guarded-then-vulnerable arc. Bridge seamless:
    connects BEFORE (contract signing, survival motivation) to AFTER (photograph scandal,
    forced separation). Setting continuity perfect: kitchen established, villa geography
    consistent. DEDUCTION: Word count exceeds range by 46 words (496 vs 300-450 max).
    This is a technical violation but doesn''t affect narrative quality or beat execution.'
