  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 three-act beats clearly present—Act 1 establishes Kenji''s
    corporate loss and Yuki''s letter (Setup/Inciting Incident/FPP); Act 2A shows
    village arrival, Haruki mentorship, wedding prep obstacles (Rising Action); Act
    2B features festival realization, letter discovery, business call temptation,
    emotional confrontation (Complications/SPP); Act 3 delivers wedding resolution
    and bamboo shop ending (Climax/Denouement). All 8 core elements preserved with
    fidelity. Japanese aesthetic masterfully executed through sensory details (rain,
    incense, tatami, lanterns, bamboo). Quiet drama tone consistently maintained with
    restrained emotional beats. Theme of people-over-ambition woven throughout. DEDUCTIONS:
    Word count 1247 exceeds target range 550-750 by 497 words (66% over limit)—significant
    structural violation. Structural accuracy slightly reduced because Act 2 division
    (2A/2B split) could be more explicitly marked; midpoint transition feels organic
    but less architecturally distinct than ideal three-act theory demands. Minor:
    Some narrative compression in Act 2B could tighten pacing. CALIBRATION: Despite
    word count excess, conversion quality is exceptional—beats are textbook-perfect,
    preservation complete, tone immaculate. Word count violation is material but doesn''t
    undermine conversion accuracy.'
