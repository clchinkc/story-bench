  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas (quarters,
    Medical, labs), discovers clues (coffee, chess, Reyes''s recording, Kronin''s
    Disease, oscillation drift), encounters mysterious transformed crew (wavering
    distortion, shapes in corners, pins-and-needles, whisper), and overcomes obstacles
    (sealed biohazard door, radiation-lockdown bulkhead). The beat clearly executes
    the ''Search'' function, showing Yuki actively investigating and adapting. All
    ''must not'' items were avoided. Character and continuity are consistent, and
    the bridge to the next beat is seamless with the mention of ''Lab Seven'' and
    the data core.'
