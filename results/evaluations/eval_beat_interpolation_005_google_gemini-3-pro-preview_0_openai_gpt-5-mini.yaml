  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability
    (bad leg, nostalgia), their relationship shifts from strictly professional to
    personal (companionable silence, his admission), a shared, connective moment occurs
    (arroz con leche, his reaction), and Maya''s internal commitment deepens (she
    realizes she''s ''guarding him'' beyond the paycheck). None of the forbidden items
    appear (no declared love, no contract breach or photograph, Alejandro does lower
    his guard). Character behavior and setting remain consistent and the scene functions
    clearly as a midpoint turning point bridging setup to subsequent betrayal.'
