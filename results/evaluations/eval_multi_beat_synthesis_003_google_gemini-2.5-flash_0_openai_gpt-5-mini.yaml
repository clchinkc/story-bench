  - Miri's backstory and moral rationale for stealing (former conservator, returns
    stolen art) is not explicitly stated in the excerpt—context is implied by tone
    but not directly shown.
  - A couple of technical beats (the thermal gel, rolling the painting into a tube
    and rapid vent exfiltration) are somewhat compressed, leaving small logical leaps
    that could use a touch more setup for full plausibility.
