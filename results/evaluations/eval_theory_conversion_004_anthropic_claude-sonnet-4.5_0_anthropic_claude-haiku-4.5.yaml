  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated: (1) You—opening
    establishes Zoe''s invisible, safe library world; (2) Need—''something was missing''
    and her hunger for real living; (3) Go—accepts the oral history program and meets
    Bernard; (4) Search—fumbling interviews, surface questions, mother''s pressure,
    near-quitting; (5) Find—breakthrough moment where Bernard trusts her and shares
    his truth; (6) Take—town hall presentation where she gives voice publicly despite
    fear; (7) Return—comes back to ordinary library setting; (8) Change—demonstrated
    through journalism applications, funeral speech, and reframed relationship with
    fear. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral
    history program, Ms. Okafor (initiator), Bernard Park (key relationship), social
    anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (climactic scene), Bernard''s
    death (October), journalism school ending. Tone is consistently gentle, intimate,
    and emotionally true—introspective without melodrama, vulnerable without self-pity.
    Minor deduction (0.05) on structural accuracy: the ''Take'' beat could be slightly
    more explicit about the cost/price paid, though the emotional stakes are clear.
    Minor tone deduction (0.05): one phrase (''like a reckoning'') edges slightly
    toward dramatic rather than intimate, though it recovers quickly.'
