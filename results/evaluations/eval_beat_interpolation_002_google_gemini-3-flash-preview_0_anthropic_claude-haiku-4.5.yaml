  evidence: 'ELEMENTS FOUND (3/4): (1) Sarah considers recanting—explicitly stated
    ''Recanting was the path of least resistance.'' (2) Official channels discussed—Marcus
    proposes Captain, feds, protocol. (3) Internal conflict about duty vs. sister—''My
    duty is to my blood'' vs. Marcus''s ''duty to the law.'' MISSING: No clear moment/conversation
    that tips her toward the third option (going rogue without resigning). The decision
    feels premature. VIOLATIONS (2/4): (1) MAJOR: Sarah already decides to resign
    and go vigilante during this beat (''she couldn''t be a cop''), which skips the
    debate''s function—the decision should crystallize BY the end, not be fully formed
    mid-beat. (2) MODERATE: The dark sedan observation and internal realization about
    the failing system feels like she''s already committed to going rogue, not wrestling
    with it. WORD COUNT: 401 exceeds 400-word limit by 1 word (minor). CHARACTER:
    Sarah''s voice is consistent—sharp, conflicted, determined. Marcus is well-drawn
    as the voice of protocol. BRIDGE: Connects well to ''Break Into Two'' (resignation
    letter), though the transition happens too early within the Debate beat itself.
    CONTINUITY: Setting (diner, sedan, precinct) is coherent. The photo and stakes
    remain consistent with the Catalyst.'
