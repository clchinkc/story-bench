  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Recanting
    option explored with visceral rejection (''curdled in her gut''). (2) Official
    channels considered in detail with Marcus Webb conversation. (3) Internal conflict
    between duty to badge vs. duty to family clearly articulated. (4) Third option
    emerges organically through dialogue and reflection. Beat authentically captures
    the Debate function—Sarah wrestles with genuine alternatives before committing.
    Character voice is consistent, analytical yet emotional. Bridge to Break Into
    Two is seamless (resignation letter). VIOLATIONS: (1) Word count exceeds range
    by 115 words (515 vs. 250-400 max)—significant structural issue. (2) Sarah has
    already decided to resign and go rogue by end of Debate beat (''By dawn, resolve
    hardened...She drafted the resignation letter''), which violates the must-not
    requirement that she shouldn''t immediately decide to go rogue during this beat.
    The decision should crystallize at the Break Into Two moment, not before. MINOR:
    Continuity slightly fuzzy on timeline (when exactly does she resign?), but setting
    remains coherent. Character consistency is strong throughout.'
