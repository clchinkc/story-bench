  evidence: 'All four required elements present: (1) Marcus Thorne introduced as mentor
    character with clear wisdom and experience; (2) Practical wisdom delivered (''Heroes
    die young...researchers survive'') and tangible tools provided (compass, satchel,
    vial); (3) Elena''s doubt shifts to reluctant acceptance (''Maybe—just maybe—she
    wasn''t as unprepared as she thought''); (4) Librarian skills explicitly reframed
    as valuable (''You organize information, find patterns, solve puzzles''). No violations
    of must-not criteria: Elena remains doubtful and hesitant, Marcus provides guidance
    without solving problems or accompanying her, setting remains at the curiosity
    shop (not forest), no magical powers discovered. Character voice perfectly consistent—Elena''s
    skepticism and Marcus''s knowing wisdom maintain established personalities. Bridge
    seamless: Elena enters refusing the call, exits with tools and reframed perspective.
    Continuity perfect: ''AFTER'' section shows Elena at forest edge with Marcus''s
    gifts, directly following this beat. Execution clearly fulfills the mentor beat''s
    narrative function of providing wisdom, tools, and preparation while maintaining
    the hero''s agency and doubt.'
