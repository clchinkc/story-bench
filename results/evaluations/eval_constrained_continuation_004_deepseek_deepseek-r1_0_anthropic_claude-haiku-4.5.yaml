      \ context/manuscript subject"
    - "\u2713 No graphic violence: Murders mentioned abstractly ('slit throats,' 'grisly\

    - "\u2713 No romantic subplot: Thomas relationship remains professional/collegial;\
      \ no romantic tension"
    - "\u2713 No easy solution: Financial crisis remains acute; publishing is desperate\
      \ gamble, not guaranteed fix"
    tone_assessment: 'Gothic tension masterfully maintained through fog imagery, graveyard
      setting, brick attack, and ominous manuscript content. Feminist undertones strong:
      Eleanor''s defiance of gender expectations, her claiming authority, dismissing
      sexist foreman. Victorian atmosphere rich with period details (umbrellas, pseudonyms,
      ledgers, typesetter). Minor deduction only for slightly modern phrasing in places
      (''sharp-eyed typesetter'').'
    ending_assessment: Excellent execution. Eleanor stands 'amidst the presses' rhythmic
      thrum' committed to dangerous path. Act 2 clearly begun with active resistance,
      escalating stakes, and 'eyes watching Blackwood & Sons.' Final line 'Let the
      danger come; she'd meet it with ink and iron resolve' perfectly captures her
      commitment and the gothic tension ahead.
    critical_issue: "Word count significantly below requirement (387 vs. 500-700 minimum).\
      \ This is a hard constraint failure. The narrative is well-crafted but underdeveloped\u2014\
      could benefit from expanded scenes: more detail on Eleanor's first day managing\
      \ the press, deeper exploration of Thomas's internal conflict, fuller development\
      \ of the manuscript's dangerous implications, or additional obstacles in Act\
      \ 2 opening."
  overall_assessment: Strong narrative execution with all qualitative requirements
    met excellently. However, the hard constraint violation (word count 23% below
    minimum) prevents a passing score. The story demonstrates sophisticated understanding
    of three-act structure, character development, and gothic tone, but needs approximately
    113-313 additional words to meet specifications.
