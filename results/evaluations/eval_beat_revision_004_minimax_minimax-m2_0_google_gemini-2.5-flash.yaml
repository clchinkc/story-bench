  evidence: The model correctly identified the flaw as 'telling' vs. 'showing' and
    info-dumping. It attempted to fix this by creating a scene. While it did introduce
    action and dialogue, the changes were extensive, resulting in a near-complete
    rewrite rather than minimal surgical edits. The quality is good, but some 'telling'
    still exists (e.g., 'her sharp instincts, honed over a decade of chasing cold
    trails, prickled with recognition').
