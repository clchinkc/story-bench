  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 (Fun and Games): ''Things going according to plan (mostly)'' - The plan
    IMMEDIATELY fails when the painting''s alarm is revealed mid-heist. This violates
    the ''mostly'' qualifier and undermines the beat''s structure.'
  - 'Beat 1 (Fun and Games): ''Introduction of an unexpected complication (minor)''
    - The complication (painting as tracking device) is MAJOR, not minor, and arrives
    too early, collapsing into Beat 2.'
  - 'Beat 2 (Midpoint): ''False victory: a key objective achieved'' - No clear false
    victory. The painting is stolen but immediately compromised. The beat lacks the
    triumphant moment before stakes escalate.'
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In): ''A crew member compromised or in danger'' - Luca
    is present but never truly compromised or in danger. He escapes cleanly. The threat
    to him is implied but not dramatized.'
  - 'Cross-beat Constraint (Chekhov''s Gun): The setup-to-payoff is muddled. The Taser
    is introduced but its payoff is scattered across multiple moments without clear
    causality. The ''fish lure'' hook disappears from narrative focus.'
  - 'Cross-beat Constraint (Tonal Escalation): Tone is inconsistent WITHIN beats,
    not across them. Beat 1 oscillates between playful and panicked. Beat 3 shifts
    to melodrama (revenge focus on Voss) rather than gallows humor, breaking the Ocean''s
    Eleven tone.'
  - 'Narrative Coherence: The ending abandons the heist objective entirely. Miri chooses
    Luca over the painting, but this choice isn''t set up as a dilemma—it happens
    reactively. The revenge subplot (Voss) emerges suddenly and overwhelms the primary
    plot.'
  - 'Mentor Presence Arc: Voss appears suddenly in Beat 2 without proper foreshadowing
    in Beat 1. Her role escalates but feels imposed rather than inevitable. The ''she
    taught Miri'' backstory is told, not shown.'
  - 'Team Dynamics (Luca): Luca''s arc is unclear. He''s loyal but passive. His final
    line (''You always pick the painting'') suggests conflict, but this hasn''t been
    established across the beats.'
  - 'Context Maintenance: The ''Ocean''s Eleven meets art history'' tone is lost by
    Beat 3, replaced with action-thriller melodrama and romantic tension that wasn''t
    established.'
  strengths:
  - Vivid, stylish prose with strong voice and sensory detail
  - Excellent character voice for Miri (dry wit, meticulous)
  - Strong setup of crew roles and skills in Beat 1
  - Voss reveal is dramatically effective
  - High-stakes action sequences are well-paced
  - The painting-as-alarm concept is clever
  weaknesses:
  - 'Structural collapse: Beats bleed into each other without clear turning points'
  - False victory missing entirely—no moment of 'we got it' before complications
  - 'Tonal whiplash: shifts from heist-comedy to revenge-thriller without bridge'
  - Luca's character arc underdeveloped; his emotional stakes unclear until final
    line
  - Chekhov's Gun elements (Taser, hook, EMP) lack clean payoff chains
  - Ending abandons heist plot for personal revenge, violating genre expectations
  - Word count 2.2x over limit; excessive prose dilutes beat clarity
  - Voss antagonism feels sudden; needs Beat 1 foreshadowing
  overall_score: 0.73
  assessment: 'The story demonstrates strong prose and character voice but fails to
    execute the three-beat structure cleanly. Beat 1 lacks the ''mostly successful''
    setup required for heist stories; complications arrive too early and too severe.
    Beat 2 has no false victory moment. Beat 3 pivots to revenge/romance rather than
    maintaining heist tension. Cross-beat constraints are partially met: Chekhov''s
    Gun is present but scattered; tonal escalation is inconsistent; mentor presence
    works but lacks foreshadowing; team dynamics (Luca) are underdeveloped. The narrative
    is coherent as action but incoherent as Save the Cat structure. Recommend: restructure
    to give Beat 1 a clean setup phase, create a distinct false victory in Beat 2,
    and either commit to the heist as primary plot or establish the revenge subplot
    earlier.'
