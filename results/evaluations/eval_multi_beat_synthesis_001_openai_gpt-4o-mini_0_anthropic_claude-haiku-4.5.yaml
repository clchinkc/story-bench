  - 'Beat 1: Revelation of enemy within Resonant community (traitor) - The killer''s
    identity and connection to the community is not clearly established as a traitor/insider
    threat in Beat 1; this emerges only in Beat 3'

    Beat 2 are not meaningfully used in Beat 3''s resolution. Rosa''s teachings are
    referenced but the specific tools gathered are not deployed in the confrontation'
  detailed_analysis:
    beat_1_tests_allies_enemies:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied:
      - Dante encounters Felix, a Resonant who distrusts him initially (skepticism,
        hostility)
      - 'Test of ability under pressure: reading the crimson stain to detect the trap'
      - 'Dante must prove himself to gain ally: Felix''s skepticism transforms to
        cooperation'
      - 'Reference to addiction/recovery: ''You''re just a junkie who got lucky''
        and later the vial of old drug'
      unsatisfied:
      - Revelation of enemy within community (traitor) - not clearly established in
        this beat; the killer's insider status is not revealed until Beat 3
    beat_2_approach_inmost_cave:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied:
      - 'Planning confrontation: ''We need to act before he strikes again'' and preparation
        to search for clues'
      - 'Dante realizes confrontation requires facing guilt about sister: ''The killer
        had a connection to his sister, a thread that tightened around his throat'''
      - 'Preparation scene: gathering sketchbook, map, vial of drug'
      - 'Moment of doubt/fear: ''each step feeling heavier, like wading through molasses''
        and Felix offering to turn back'
      - 'Symbolic threshold: crossing into the killer''s domain, ''the air crackling
        with tension'''

        and ''succumbed to the depths of his guilt'''
      - 'Moment where all seems lost: ''the darkness threatened to swallow him whole'''
      - 'Transformation through acceptance: ''I failed her...But I will not let her
        death be in vain'' - guilt accepted rather than denied'

        acceptance'' - emotional/spiritual victory before physical'

    cross_beat_constraints:
      chekhov_gun:
        score: 0.5
        status: PARTIALLY SATISFIED
        analysis: Rosa's teachings are introduced in Beat 1 and become crucial in
          Beat 3 ('He remembered Rosa's teachings, the colors that had once guided
          him'). However, the specific tools gathered in Beat 2 (sketchbook, map,
          vial) are not deployed in the actual confrontation. The vial is mentioned
          as 'a symbol of the struggle he'd overcome' but doesn't function as a plot
          device. Rosa's emotional guidance works as Chekhov's Gun, but the physical
          tools do not.
      character_arc_progression:
        score: 1.0
        status: SATISFIED
        analysis: 'Beat 1: Guilt mentioned (''memories of his sister''s laughter drowned
          by guilt''). Beat 2: Guilt recognized as obstacle (''The killer had a connection
          to his sister, a thread that tightened around his throat every time he breathed'').
          Beat 3: Guilt transformed through acceptance (''I failed her...But I will
          not let her death be in vain''). Clear progression from acknowledgment to
          obstacle to transformation.'
      rising_stakes:
        score: 1.0
        status: SATISFIED
        analysis: 'Beat 1: Personal test with a fellow Resonant, low-stakes alliance
          building. Beat 2: Planning to confront a serial killer, medium stakes with
          personal emotional weight. Beat 3: Direct confrontation with killer in their
          lair, highest stakes with life-or-death consequences and emotional climax.'
      ally_continuity:
        score: 1.0
        status: SATISFIED
        analysis: 'Felix is present and relevant throughout: Beat 1 (gained as ally),
          Beat 2 (''Together with Felix, he stepped out of the lair'' - implied presence
          in planning), Beat 3 (explicitly mentioned as accompanying Dante: ''Together
          with Felix, he stepped out of the lair''). Continuity maintained.'
    context_maintenance:
      protagonist: 0.95
      analysis_protagonist: 'Dante''s character is well-maintained: recovering addict
        (referenced), guilt about sister (central), ability to see emotional residue
        (core mechanic used throughout), noir-tinged determination evident'
      setting: 0.85
      analysis_setting: Buckingham Hotel established as nexus of emotional residue.
        Contemporary Chicago implied but not explicitly reinforced. Hidden Resonant
        underworld well-portrayed. Setting could be more distinctly Chicago-specific
      tone: 0.9
      analysis_tone: Noir-tinged urban fantasy maintained throughout. Melancholic
        but determined voice consistent. Redemption arc clearly present. Emotional
        weight and darkness balanced with hope
    coherence:
      score: 0.85
      strengths:
      - Clear narrative progression through three beats
      - Emotional through-line from guilt to acceptance
      - Felix's presence provides continuity
      - Thematic consistency around emotional resonance and acceptance
      weaknesses:
      - Transition between Beat 2 and Beat 3 is abrupt; the actual confrontation begins
        immediately without clear passage of time
      - The killer's motivation and connection to Dante's sister is revealed only
        in dialogue, not shown through discovery
      - Some exposition-heavy dialogue in Beat 3 ('Welcome, Dante...I've been waiting
        for you') feels slightly convenient
  overall_assessment: "This is a strong execution of the Hero's Journey framework\
    \ with 13/15 beat requirements satisfied and 3/4 cross-beat constraints met. The\
    \ story maintains excellent context fidelity and coherence. The primary weakness\
    \ is the incomplete Chekhov's Gun constraint\u2014while Rosa's teachings function\
    \ as a plot device, the physical tools gathered in Beat 2 are not meaningfully\
    \ deployed in Beat 3. The traitor/insider threat element of Beat 1 is also underdeveloped.\
    \ Despite these gaps, the character arc is compelling, stakes escalate effectively,\
    \ and the thematic exploration of guilt and acceptance is well-executed. The noir\
    \ tone and urban fantasy setting are consistently maintained."
