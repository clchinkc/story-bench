  model_said_no_revision: true
  evidence: 'The model replied ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' and justified why the passage
    fulfills Dark Night of the Soul: cites gallery closure (All Is Lost), isolation
    (dark apartment, unanswered brother), genuine despair and reflection (floor, tears,
    failed promise), whiff of death (hospice/mother). Minor inaccuracy: the explanation
    references a ''line about "tomorrow"'' preserving the wallow, which does not appear
    in the provided segment—hence a small deduction.'
