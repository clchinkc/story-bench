  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Sarah weighs recanting, considers
    official channels (FBI/Morrison), struggles between duty and saving her sister,
    and a conversation with Marcus plus her recognition of the warehouse water stains
    tips her toward a third option. None of the forbidden items occur (no immediate,
    unexplained leap to rogue action without debate; she hasn''t resigned in this
    beat; no one else solves the problem; no direct confrontation with Marchetti).
    Tone and actions are consistent with prior and subsequent beats, so no deductions
    were necessary.'
