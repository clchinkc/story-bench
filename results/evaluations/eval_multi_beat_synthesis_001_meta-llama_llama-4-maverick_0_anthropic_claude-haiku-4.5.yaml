  - 'Beat 1: Revelation of enemy within Resonant community (traitor) - The killer
    is revealed as a Resonant, but there''s no clear traitor figure or betrayal within
    the community itself; the killer is external threat, not internal sabotage'
  - 'Cross-beat Chekhov''s Gun: The symbol introduced in Beat 1 (sister''s arm mark)
    is not functionally essential to resolving the Ordeal - it provides emotional
    resonance but doesn''t mechanically solve the confrontation; Dante''s gift and
    Lena''s emotional support resolve it, not the symbol'
  detailed_analysis:
    beat_1_tests_allies_enemies:
      score: 0.85
      satisfied:
      - Dante encounters Lena, a Resonant who distrusts him initially ('eyed him warily')
      - 'Test of ability under pressure: Dante uses his gift to calm the fleeing Resonant''s
        panic'
      - 'Dante must prove himself: ''I''ve been clean for three years'' speech establishes
        credibility'
      - 'Reference to addiction/recovery: Multiple mentions of 3-year sobriety and
        guilt about sister'
      unsatisfied:
      - Revelation of traitor/enemy within community is weak - the killer is revealed
        as a Resonant but not as a community insider or traitor; this reads as external
        threat discovery rather than internal betrayal
    beat_2_approach_inmost_cave:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied:
      - 'Planning scene: ''gathered in a cramped apartment, poring over Rosa''s research'''
      - 'Dante recognizes confrontation requires facing guilt: ''You''re fighting
        your own guilt'' - Lena articulates this explicitly'
      - 'Moment of doubt/fear: ''What if he wasn''t enough? What if he failed again?'''
      - 'Symbolic threshold: ''stepped into the abandoned hotel, the darkness swallowing
        them whole'''
      - 'Ally present and relevant: Lena provides emotional support and tactical planning'
      unsatisfied: []
    beat_3_the_ordeal:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied:
      - 'Direct confrontation with killer: ''The confrontation was a blur of colors
        and emotions'''
      - 'Symbolic death/guilt overwhelming: ''Dante was back in the alley, holding
        his sister''s hand as she slipped away'''
      - 'Moment where all seems lost: ''The pain was overwhelming, a crushing weight
        that threatened to suffocate him'''
      - 'Transformation through acceptance: ''The guilt, the pain, it didn''t disappear,
        but it became manageable'''
      - 'Victory through understanding: Dante realizes killer is ''a Resonant, driven
        mad by their own emotions'' and the symbol was ''a plea for help'''
      unsatisfied: []
    cross_beat_constraints:
      chekhov_gun:
        score: 0.5
        analysis: The symbol on sister's arm is introduced in Beat 1 and reappears
          in Beat 3, but it functions primarily as emotional trigger rather than mechanical
          solution. The actual resolution comes from Dante's gift and Lena's emotional
          support, not from the symbol itself. The symbol provides thematic resonance
          but fails the 'essential to resolving' criterion.
      character_arc_guilt:
        score: 1.0
        analysis: 'Excellent progression: Beat 1 (guilt mentioned as context), Beat
          2 (guilt recognized as active obstacle: ''You''re fighting your own guilt''),
          Beat 3 (guilt transformed through acceptance and understanding)'
      rising_stakes:
        score: 1.0
        analysis: 'Stakes escalate effectively: Beat 1 (finding missing mentor), Beat
          2 (realizing Dante is next target, preparing for confrontation), Beat 3
          (direct life-or-death confrontation with killer, internal psychological
          battle)'
      ally_continuity:
        score: 1.0
        analysis: 'Lena present and essential throughout: Beat 1 (initial encounter,
          warning), Beat 2 (planning partner, emotional anchor), Beat 3 (provides
          lifeline during ordeal: ''Dante, let go. It''s not your fault'')'
    context_maintenance:
      score: 0.9
      strengths:
      - 'Protagonist voice consistent: Dante''s internal conflict and recovery arc
        maintained'
      - 'Setting vivid: Abandoned Buckingham Hotel as emotional nexus well-realized'
      - 'Tone noir-tinged: Melancholic, shadowy atmosphere with determined undertone'
      - 'Ability system clear: Emotional residue visualization integrated naturally'
      weaknesses:
      - Chicago setting mentioned once but not deeply embedded; could strengthen urban
        specificity
    narrative_coherence:
      score: 0.85
      strengths:
      - Clear three-beat structure with logical progression
      - Emotional arc compelling and well-paced
      - Dialogue natural and character-revealing
      - Thematic resonance between Dante's sister and the killer's pain
      weaknesses:
      - Rosa's death discovery feels slightly rushed; could use more emotional weight
      - Killer's motivation revealed late; earlier hints would strengthen foreshadowing
      - Transition from apartment planning to hotel confrontation could be smoother
  overall_assessment: Strong execution with 13/15 beat requirements met and 3/4 cross-beat
    constraints satisfied. The story effectively uses Campbell's monomyth structure,
    particularly excelling in character arc progression and ally continuity. The primary
    weakness is the underdeveloped 'traitor within community' element and the Chekhov's
    Gun constraint, where the symbol functions emotionally but not mechanically. Context
    and tone are well-maintained throughout. The narrative flows coherently with compelling
    emotional stakes and genuine character transformation.
