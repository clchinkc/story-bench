  evidence: 'The model misdiagnosed the problem (declaring ''NO REVISION NEEDED'')
    and therefore did not correct the actual All Is Lost flaw. The required elements
    and four specified phrases are present (so preservation and required_preserved
    scores are 1.0), but the rewrite fails to enact the necessary story beats: the
    fundraiser/grant failure, betrayal/isolation, exhausted options, and a true ''whiff
    of death'' are missing or only lightly implied. Changes were moderate (several
    rewritten paragraphs rather than surgical edits), so minimal_change_score is 0.5.
    The response also exceeded the requested word-count range, making word_count_valid
    false. Overall writing is adequate but the core diagnostic and corrective tasks
    were not accomplished.'
