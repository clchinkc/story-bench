  evidence: "All four required elements are present: multiple explored areas (quarters,\
    \ Medical, supply bay, corridor), clues (paused recording, notes on oscillation,\
    \ Kronin's Disease), mysterious encounters with transformed crew (distortions,\
    \ whispers, humanoid shapes), and obstacles overcome (sealed biohazard door, radiation\
    \ lockdown, spoofing panels, scanner bursts). The passage functions clearly as\
    \ the 'Search' beat, advancing through trials and incremental progress toward\
    \ Lab Seven. No forbidden items appear. The only deduction: word count is 419,\
    \ which is outside the required 250\u2013400 range."
