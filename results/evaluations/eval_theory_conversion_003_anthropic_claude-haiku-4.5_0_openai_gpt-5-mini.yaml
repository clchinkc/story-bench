  evidence: 'All four three-act beats are clearly represented: Act 1 setup (Kenji''s
    emptied life and the inciting letter; he boards the train), Act 2 confrontation
    (adaptation in the village, learning from Haruki, the midpoint temptation of a
    business offer, followed by Yuki''s rejection as the second plot point), Act 3
    resolution (Kenji declines the deal, apologizes, watches the wedding, begins reconciliation,
    and opens a bamboo shop). All eight required elements (Kenji, lost career, Yuki,
    Kyoto wedding, Haruki, business temptation, theme of choosing people over ambition,
    and the bamboo craft shop ending) are present. The prose maintains a quiet, redemptive
    Japanese aesthetic throughout. No deductions applied.'
