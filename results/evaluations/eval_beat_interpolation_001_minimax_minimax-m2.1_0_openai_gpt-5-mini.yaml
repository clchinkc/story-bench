  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name
    and location (''Marcus''s Curiosity Shop'', ''Marcus stood behind the counter'');
    he provides practical wisdom and tools (shelf items, pouch, herbs, compass and
    advice: ''the forest tests intentions...''); Elena''s doubt begins to shift (''something
    small and stubborn flickered to life... Reluctant. Uncertain. But no longer entirely
    refusal.''); and her librarian skills are reframed as useful (''A librarian. Someone
    who finds patterns...''). None of the must-not items occur: she does not become
    immediately confident or eager, Marcus does not solve her problems or offer to
    accompany her, she is not in/near the forest (she''s in the shop), and she does
    not discover magical powers. Character voice and behavior are consistent, and
    the scene bridges the Refusal and Crossing beats (Marcus''s parting words echo
    into the Crossing scene). No deductions made.'
