  evidence: "All eight Dan Harmon beats are present and in clear sequence: Zoe's comfort\
    \ zone, her need for connection, entering the oral-history program, learning and\
    \ adapting while interviewing, the breakthrough with Bernard, taking responsibility\
    \ via the town-hall presentation, returning to ordinary life, and demonstrated\
    \ change (applying to journalism). All eight required elements (Zoe, library/program,\
    \ Ms. Okafor, Bernard, Zoe's social anxiety, town hall, Bernard's death, journalism\
    \ application/ending) are preserved. The only deduction is word_count_valid=false\
    \ because the provided converted text is 786 words, outside the specified 500\u2013\
    700 range."
