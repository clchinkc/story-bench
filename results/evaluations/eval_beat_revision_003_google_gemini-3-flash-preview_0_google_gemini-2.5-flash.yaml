  evidence: 'The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie not showing
    evidence of change upon her return. It implemented all the required fixes: Sophie
    responds differently to work stress (puts phone on silent), applies an insight
    from the retreat (''stillness was what I really needed'', ''peaceful detachment''),
    shows behavioral markers of change (not frantic, reclaiming life, seeing city
    differently), and her mother notices something different (''braced for Sophie’s
    usual frantic response''). The changes were surgical and minimal, preserving the
    original structure while effectively demonstrating the ''Return (Having Changed)''
    beat.'
