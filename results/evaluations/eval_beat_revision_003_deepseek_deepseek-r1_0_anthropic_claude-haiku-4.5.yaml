  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation
    and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.
    The revision fixes this precisely by: (1) Adding the meditation insight (''As
    the monks had taught her''), (2) Demonstrating changed behavior through action
    (silencing phone, choosing to wait until morning), (3) Showing internal struggle
    then resolution (thumb hovering, then breathing), (4) Including mother''s notice
    of change (''Your mother blinked''), (5) Contrasting old self (would have called
    Linda immediately) with new self (lets it rest). All 4 required phrases preserved
    exactly: ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare'', ''How was Thailand? her mother
    asked'', ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'', ''It''s good to be home, she
    said''. Changes were surgical: inserted meditation breathing technique, replaced
    phone-scrolling with phone-silencing, added mother''s reaction, expanded final
    paragraph to show new perception of familiar world. The new material (approximately
    80 words added/modified) integrates seamlessly into original structure. No new
    errors introduced. Writing quality elevated through sensory details (''sugar in
    hot water'', ''streetlights reflected like floating lanterns'', ''city''s hum
    felt like breath''). Beat execution now complete: Return shows physical return
    + clear transformation + behavioral proof + integrated lesson + external validation.'
