  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the Three-Act
    Structure, hitting all the required beats and preserving all core elements. The
    tone is largely maintained, though the 'quiet drama' could be slightly more pronounced
    in the emotional beats. Structural accuracy is good, but the 'Second Plot Point'
    (Yuki uninviting Kenji) feels a little rushed in its impact and resolution, making
    the transition to Act 3 slightly less impactful than it could be.
