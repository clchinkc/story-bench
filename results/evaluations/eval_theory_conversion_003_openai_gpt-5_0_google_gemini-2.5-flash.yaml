  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the Three-Act
    Structure, hitting all the key beats. All 8 core elements are preserved. The tone
    is perfectly maintained. The primary issue is the word count, which significantly
    exceeds the requested range. Structurally, while all beats are present, the Act
    2B feels a bit rushed in its progression from the temptation to the resolution
    of that temptation, making the 'Second Plot Point' feel less impactful than it
    could be, hence the 0.8 for structural accuracy.
