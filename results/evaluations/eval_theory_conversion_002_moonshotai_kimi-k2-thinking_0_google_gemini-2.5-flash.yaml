  evidence: All 12 beats of the Hero's Journey are clearly present and well-integrated
    into the narrative. All 7 core elements are preserved. The word count is within
    the valid range. The tone is consistently quiet, meditative, and transformative
    throughout the story. The structural accuracy is excellent, with each Harmon beat
    effectively expanded into the corresponding Campbell stages.
