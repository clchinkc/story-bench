  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: multiple areas explored (crew
    quarters, medical bay, corridors), clues discovered (patient files, Dr. Chen''s
    cut-off log), mysterious encounters with transformed crew (shadows, whispers,
    shifting forms), and an obstacle overcome (using a plasma torch to buy time).
    None of the prohibited items occur: she does not immediately find the data core
    in the Search passage, the crew do not explain everything, she does not leave,
    and she did not arrive already knowing the transformation (she deduces it from
    evidence). Setting and character behavior remain consistent and the passage effectively
    bridges the Before and After beats.'
