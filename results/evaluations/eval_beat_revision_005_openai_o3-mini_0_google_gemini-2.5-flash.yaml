  evidence: The model did not recognize the segment was fine. It rewrote the segment,
    indicating it believed a revision was needed. While the rewrite itself is good
    and incorporates the 'whiff of death' more explicitly, the original segment already
    met all criteria, including the 'whiff of death' through the mother's passing
    and the hospice memory. The model over-diagnosed.
