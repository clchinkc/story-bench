  evidence: "The model addressed the actual flaw: Sophie returns having changed. Evidence:\
    \ it replaces immediate email-checking with putting the phone away, explicitly\
    \ has her tell her mother that things can wait ('everything will be there tomorrow'),\
    \ includes the mother's observation ('That's a change'), and adds sensory detail\
    \ showing a new perspective (noticing streetlight glow). These are direct behavioral\
    \ and perceptual markers of integration from the retreat. Changes were minimal\
    \ and surgical\u2014core lines and structure were preserved while swapping a few\
    \ beats to show transformation, so preservation requirements and the four required\
    \ phrases remain intact."
