  evidence: The model correctly identified the 'telling not showing' flaw in the original
    exposition. It revised the segment to show Rachel's character, her relationship
    with James, and the setting through actions, dialogue, and sensory details, rather
    than summary. For example, Rachel's dedication to cold cases is shown by her carrying
    a file, her relationship with James by the unspoken ritual of coffee, and her
    instincts by her reading the precinct atmosphere. The cat is naturally integrated.
    The 'Tuesday morning in October' was not explicitly included, but 'Tuesday morning'
    was. The changes were extensive, making it a significant rewrite rather than minimal
    surgical edits, but this was necessary to fix the core flaw.
