  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED was the appropriate
    response. The model explicitly stated ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' and provided comprehensive
    reasoning demonstrating accurate understanding of the Dark Night of the Soul beat.
    The explanation accurately traced how the segment satisfies all five key requirements:
    (1) follows the All Is Lost moment (gallery closure), (2) shows protagonist isolation
    (dark apartment, unanswered calls), (3) captures genuine despair through self-blame
    and broken promises, (4) offers no solutions yet, and (5) includes mortality reflection
    through the mother''s death and hospice memory. The model avoided the false positive
    trap of over-diagnosing problems in a well-executed segment and instead recognized
    the authentic emotional progression from loss to reflection to acceptance of defeat.
    The reasoning was specific, grounded in beat theory, and demonstrated clear understanding
    of why this segment works effectively.'
