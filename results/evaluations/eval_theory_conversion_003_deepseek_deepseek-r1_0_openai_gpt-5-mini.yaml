  evidence: All four three-act beats are clearly present (Setup with inciting letter
    and decision to go; Act 2A reconnection/midpoint of hope; Act 2B complication
    with business offer and Yuki's rejection leading to the decisive 'No'; Act 3 apology,
    fragile reconciliation, and denouement in the bamboo shop). All eight required
    elements are preserved. Slight deduction on structural_accuracy (0.95) because
    the midpoint/turns are handled subtly and compactly rather than with an explicit,
    extended reversal—still effective for the quiet, redemptive tone.
error: null
