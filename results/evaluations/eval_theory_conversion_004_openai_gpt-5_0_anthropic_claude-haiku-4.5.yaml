  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats present and clearly mapped: (1) You—library
    comfort zone established with sensory detail; (2) Need—absence articulated (''outline
    around her days where something should be''); (3) Go—accepts recorder, travels
    to Bernard''s house; (4) Search—five interviews showing adaptation and learning
    silence; (5) Find—breakthrough moment (''listening stopped being a hiding place'');
    (6) Take—town hall presentation, accepts responsibility; (7) Return—post-program
    life, continued visits, Bernard''s death, funeral speech; (8) Change—senior year
    applications, confident barista interaction, mentoring new volunteers. All 8 core
    elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history program,
    Ms. Okafor (mentor), Bernard Park (key relationship), social anxiety (woven throughout),
    town hall presentation (twice, escalated), journalism school ending. Tone is consistently
    gentle, intimate, and emotionally true with lyrical prose (''stories that held
    their breath,'' ''like a bell,'' ''cone of light''). Structure maps cleanly to
    Harmon''s framework. Primary deduction: word count exceeds target range by 230
    words (33% over), which violates the specified constraint. This is a structural
    requirement issue, not a quality issue. The conversion itself is exceptional.'
