  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he offers practical wisdom and tangible tools (satchel with items); Marcus reframes
    Elena''s librarian skills as useful; Elena''s doubt shifts toward reluctant acceptance
    rather than immediate confidence. None of the prohibited items appear (no instant
    confidence, no mentor accompaniment/solutions, Elena is not placed in/near the
    forest during this beat, and she does not discover magical powers). The only deduction
    is that the output length (≈575 words) exceeds the required 200–350 word range.'
