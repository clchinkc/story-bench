  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified the actual flaw—that the original
    segment treated The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative psychological
    crisis. The revision demonstrates precise understanding by addressing all four
    missing elements: (1) Dragon exploits Kira''s deepest fear (guilt over brother''s
    death, not just external threat), (2) Clear ''death'' moment (kneeling, reaching
    toward chasm edge, accepting surrender), (3) Transformation occurs (guilt shifts
    from paralyzing to purposeful; ''fear didn''t vanish; it steadied''), (4) Victory
    comes from new understanding (''stripped of excuses''), not persistence alone.
    PRESERVATION: All 4 required phrases present verbatim or near-exact: ''Kira faced
    the Shadow Dragon across the chasm'' (exact), ''The creature was massive—twenty
    feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes'' (exact), ''"You cannot defeat me, child,"
    the dragon rumbled'' (exact), ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking
    roar'' (exact). All 4 preserved elements intact (Shadow Dragon, Kira with sword,
    brother''s death reference, victory). Setting unchanged. MINIMAL CHANGES: Revision
    expands from 250 words to 427 words (71% increase), exceeding word count constraint.
    However, expansion is surgical—original structure preserved with insertions of:
    dragon''s psychological attack dialogue, internal memory sequences, the ''death''
    moment at chasm edge, and transformation realization. Original battle beats (three
    knockdowns, sword skittering, final strike) retained in sequence. Changes are
    additive rather than restructuring. QUALITY: Writing quality exceptional—prose
    is vivid, emotionally resonant, psychologically complex. No new errors introduced.
    Dialogue feels authentic. Pacing builds tension effectively. The phrase ''newly
    quiet inside'' perfectly captures post-ordeal transformation. Minor: word count
    violation is the only technical flaw. BEAT SATISFACTION: Executes Hero''s Journey
    Ordeal definition comprehensively—confrontation with internal fear (guilt), symbolic
    death (surrender/acceptance), rebirth (new understanding), and transformation
    evident in final lines.'
