  evidence: All five Freytag beats (Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action,
    Denouement) appear in order and are clearly represented. All six required elements
    are preserved (Samira protagonist, engineered virus, Raj, Nexus Biotech, public
    release of the cure, Samira's career sacrifice). Structural accuracy is slightly
    reduced (−0.1) because the turning point (revelation + Nexus confrontation) and
    the immediate consequences (press release/fallout) are tightly compressed, blurring
    the distinction between Climax and Falling Action.
