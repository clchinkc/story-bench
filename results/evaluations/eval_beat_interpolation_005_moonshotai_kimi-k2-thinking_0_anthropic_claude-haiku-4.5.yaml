  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Vulnerable
    discovery: Alejandro reveals his mother''s death, the real reason for retirement,
    and his grief-driven reclusiveness. (2) Relationship shift: Explicit transition
    from ''three weeks of careful, professional distance'' to personal connection
    with intimate dialogue. (3) Shared moment: Midnight kitchen scene with saffron
    touch, collaborative paella-making, laughter, and physical proximity. (4) Maya''s
    commitment: She explicitly chooses to help him create his own identity beyond
    his mother''s memory, with final lines confirming emotional investment over financial
    motivation. Beat execution is textbook Act 2 Midpoint—protagonist commits fully,
    emotional stakes raised, point of no return established. All must-not items avoided:
    they''re not in love yet (building toward it), Maya doesn''t leave, photo isn''t
    taken here, Alejandro''s walls come down gradually and believably. Character voice
    is consistent, warm, observant. Setting continuity perfect (kitchen, villa, sea,
    established details). Bridge to ''All Is Lost'' beat is seamless—the intimacy
    created here makes the photograph scandal devastating. DEDUCTION: Word count is
    305, which falls below the 300-450 range minimum by 5 words (though technically
    within acceptable rounding). While the content is exceptional and the scene is
    complete, strict adherence to range specifications warrants minor deduction. The
    scene could accommodate 50-100 more words without losing impact (additional sensory
    details, more dialogue, deeper introspection).'
