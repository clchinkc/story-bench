  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: multiple areas explored (crew
    quarters, medical bay, hydroponics, corridors), clues discovered (medical logs,
    energy spike, Reyes''s note), encounters with transformed crew (shimmering outlines,
    whispers, flickers), and a clear obstacle overcome (high CO2, sealed corridor,
    lost scanner recovered under time pressure). No forbidden items appear: the data
    core is not immediately found in this segment, the crew do not directly explain
    events, Yuki does not leave, and she had no prior knowledge of the dimensional
    transformation. Setting and character behavior remain consistent and the section
    cleanly leads into the lab discovery that follows.'
