  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated\
    \ The Ordeal as a mere boss battle lacking internal transformation. The revision\
    \ addresses all four actual flaws: (1) Dragon exploits Kira's guilt over brother's\
    \ death\u2014explicitly stated ('Your brother begged for mercy too. His blood\
    \ still stains your hands'); (2) Symbolic death moment present\u2014'The truth\
    \ crushed her\u2014a death deeper than any wound' and 'When the third impact drove\
    \ her to her knees...she surrendered'; (3) Transformation occurs\u2014shift from\
    \ fighting in anger to fighting in penance, from blaming fate to accepting guilt;\
    \ (4) Victory from insight\u2014'she saw the opening...With strength born of acceptance'\
    \ shows victory flows from psychological rebirth, not mere persistence. PRESERVATION:\
    \ All 4 required phrases present: (a) 'Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the\
    \ chasm' \u2713, (b) 'The creature was massive\u2014twenty feet of obsidian scales\
    \ and burning eyes' \u2713, (c) '\"You cannot defeat me, child,\" the dragon rumbled'\
    \ \u2713, (d) 'The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar' \u2713\
    . All 4 story elements preserved: Shadow Dragon antagonist, Kira protagonist with\
    \ sword, brother's death reference, victorious outcome. MINIMAL CHANGES: The revision\
    \ is NOT minimally surgical\u2014approximately 60% of the original text was rewritten\
    \ or substantially expanded. The model added significant new content (dragon's\
    \ psychological attacks, internal monologue about guilt, the surrender moment,\
    \ the penance reframing) rather than surgically inserting transformation elements\
    \ into existing structure. However, the core battle sequence framework remains\
    \ recognizable. QUALITY: Writing is strong with vivid imagery ('smoke curling\
    \ from its jaws,' 'chains,' 'slithered'), effective emotional beats, and thematic\
    \ coherence. No grammatical errors. The ending reflection ('redemption wasn't\
    \ in killing monsters, but facing the one within') provides thematic closure.\
    \ Minor: 'an earth-shaking roar' should be 'a earth-shaking roar' or 'an earth-shaking\
    \ roar'\u2014original had 'an' which is correct, so this is preserved correctly."
