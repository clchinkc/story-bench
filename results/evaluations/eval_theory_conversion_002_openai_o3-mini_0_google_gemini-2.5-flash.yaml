  evidence: The 'Meeting the Mentor' beat is a bit weak, as the journal acts as a
    mentor, but it's not a direct meeting. However, it still fulfills the function.
    The 'Tests, Allies, Enemies' beat is also somewhat abstract, with nature acting
    as both. Otherwise, the structure is well-followed.
