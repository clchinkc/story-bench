  model_said_no_revision: false
  evidence: The model did not state that no revision was needed; instead it produced
    a rewritten version of the passage (see model's full rewritten paragraph). While
    the rewrite demonstrates clear understanding of the Dark Night of the Soul (isolation,
    despair, mortality references), it nonetheless performed an unnecessary revision
    rather than recognizing the original was correct.
