  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'Fun and Games: Viral TikTok moment, line wrapping around lot, sold-out paneer,
      chanting customers, high-energy service sequence'
    - 'Midpoint: Email invitation to championship qualifier arrives, creating false
      victory, immediately followed by compliance revelation that raises stakes (health
      inspection, commissary, fire suppression requirements)'
    must_include_detail:
    - '✓ Viral moment: TikTok clip with ''DISASTER'' sign goes viral, blogger repost,
      line forms'
    - '✓ Working together under demand: Dev on orders/Venmo, Priya on heat, synchronized
      rhythm, toothpick nozzle fix, elbow-heat adjustment'
    - '✓ Rival competitor: Mason Rourke''s Buckhorn BBQ (three-time champ) introduced
      with tension and smirk'
    - '✓ Midpoint false victory: Championship qualifier invitation email creates apparent
      success'
    - '✓ Stakes raised: Compliance requirements (health inspection, commissary, fire
      suppression) immediately undercut victory'
    - '✓ Genuine partnership moment: ''You''re really good at this'' exchange, shared
      look like ''two climbers realizing they''d clipped into the same rope'''
    must_not_detail:
    - '✓ No romance: Priya-Dev connection is purely professional partnership'
    - '✓ No complete failure: Business succeeds spectacularly on opening day'
    - '✓ No Dev betrayal/quitting: Dev remains committed, promises ''We can fix this'''
    - '✓ No external savior: Success earned through viral moment and their own execution'
    tone_assessment: Upbeat, energetic, witty dialogue ('I'll apologize if you hate
      it,' 'apology specialist,' 'Tell the internet we're not sorry'). Undercurrent
      of tension maintained through Mason's introduction, compliance complications,
      and stakes escalation. Minor deduction only for slight tonal shift in final
      paragraphs becoming more serious.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect execution of Midpoint requirement: apparent victory
      (qualifier invitation, sold-out success, partnership solidified) immediately
      complicated by raised stakes (compliance issues). Ends with tension and determination,
      not resolution. Email serves as both trophy and warning.'
