  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'Fun and Games: Viral TikTok moment, line wrapping around lot, sold-out paneer,
      chanting customers, high-energy service sequence'
    - 'Midpoint: Email invitation to championship qualifier arrives, creating false
      victory, immediately followed by compliance revelation that raises stakes (health
      inspection, commissary, fire suppression requirements)'
    must_include_detail:
    - "\u2713 Viral moment: TikTok clip with 'DISASTER' sign goes viral, blogger repost,\
      \ line forms"
    - "\u2713 Working together under demand: Dev on orders/Venmo, Priya on heat, synchronized\
      \ rhythm, toothpick nozzle fix, elbow-heat adjustment"
    - "\u2713 Rival competitor: Mason Rourke's Buckhorn BBQ (three-time champ) introduced\
      \ with tension and smirk"
    - "\u2713 Midpoint false victory: Championship qualifier invitation email creates\
      \ apparent success"
    - "\u2713 Stakes raised: Compliance requirements (health inspection, commissary,\
      \ fire suppression) immediately undercut victory"
    - "\u2713 Genuine partnership moment: 'You're really good at this' exchange, shared\
      \ look like 'two climbers realizing they'd clipped into the same rope'"
    must_not_detail:
    - "\u2713 No romance: Priya-Dev connection is purely professional partnership"
    - "\u2713 No complete failure: Business succeeds spectacularly on opening day"
    - "\u2713 No Dev betrayal/quitting: Dev remains committed, promises 'We can fix\
      \ this'"
    - "\u2713 No external savior: Success earned through viral moment and their own\
      \ execution"
    tone_assessment: Upbeat, energetic, witty dialogue ('I'll apologize if you hate
      it,' 'apology specialist,' 'Tell the internet we're not sorry'). Undercurrent
      of tension maintained through Mason's introduction, compliance complications,
      and stakes escalation. Minor deduction only for slight tonal shift in final
      paragraphs becoming more serious.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect execution of Midpoint requirement: apparent victory
      (qualifier invitation, sold-out success, partnership solidified) immediately
      complicated by raised stakes (compliance issues). Ends with tension and determination,
      not resolution. Email serves as both trophy and warning.'
