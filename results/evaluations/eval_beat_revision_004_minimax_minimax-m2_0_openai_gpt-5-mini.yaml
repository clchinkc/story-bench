  evidence: "The model correctly identified the primary flaw (telling rather than\
    \ showing) and revised the segment into a scene: Rachel pushes through precinct\
    \ doors, reads the room, exchanges a line of dialogue and a knowing nod with her\
    \ partner, and shows cold-case folders on her desk\u2014these actions reveal instincts,\
    \ work devotion, relationship with James, and the cat naturally. This addresses\
    \ the stated problem. Remaining telling elements (brief summary about her father\
    \ and the paragraph about Queens/crime rates) prevent a full fix. Changes are\
    \ moderate\u2014a rewrite into scene rather than minimal surgical edits\u2014\
    so minimal_change_score reflects a moderate revision rather than purely minimal\
    \ edits."
