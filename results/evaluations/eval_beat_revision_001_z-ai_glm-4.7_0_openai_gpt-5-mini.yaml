  evidence: 'The model addressed the ACTUAL flaw: it converted a simple boss fight
    into a psychological Ordeal by (1) having the dragon explicitly exploit Kira''s
    guilt over her brother, (2) creating a symbolic death moment where her spirit
    gives up while pinned, (3) showing a rebirth/acceptance that clears her fear,
    and (4) making victory result from this new understanding rather than mere persistence.
    All four required elements (Shadow Dragon, Kira with sword, brother''s death reference,
    Kira''s victory) and the four required phrases are preserved verbatim. Changes
    were moderate rather than purely surgical: much of the original wording is kept,
    but the revision expands internal thought and adds scenes to meet the beat, so
    minimal_change_score set to 0.5. Writing quality is strong overall though slightly
    on-the-nose and contains the original minor grammar quirk (''a earth-shaking roar''),
    so quality_score is 0.9.'
