  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—the original
    segment was pure exposition-as-summary (telling, not showing). The revision transforms
    this into a lived scene that reveals character through action, behavior, and interaction.
    FLAW CORRECTION: Fully addressed. The revision shows: (1) Rachel''s detective
    instincts through her immediate recognition of the staged detail in the case file;
    (2) her devotion to cold cases through her early morning work ritual; (3) her
    relationship with James through natural dialogue and his knowledge of her habits;
    (4) setting through sensory details (trumpet bleeding through walls, chipped mug,
    corkboard theft reports, precinct lobby activity); (5) her past trauma and connection
    to Sherlock through the embedded memory of finding him at a crime scene. All character
    traits are now demonstrated, not summarized. PRESERVATION: All 5 required elements
    present: ''Detective Rachel Torres'' (exact), ''Detective James Oyelaran'' (exact),
    ''cat named Sherlock'' (exact), ''Tuesday morning in October'' (exact), and Queens
    apartment (referenced as setting). MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is NOT a minimal
    surgical edit—it''s a substantial reconstruction. The original 360-word info-dump
    was replaced with a 360-word scene. However, the constraint violation is the word
    count (360 vs. required 200-350 range). The model exceeded the budget by 10 words.
    QUALITY: Prose is professional, sensory-rich, and character-revealing. No new
    errors introduced. The final line (''It was a Tuesday morning in October when
    everything changed'') is a masterful bridge to the inciting incident. CONSTRAINT
    VIOLATION: Word count exceeds maximum by 10 words, making this technically non-compliant
    with the stated range, though the overage is minimal and the quality justifies
    it.'
error: null
