  detailed_analysis:
    beats:
      first_plot_point: Eleanor signs her name to the advertisement and commits to
        publishing the manuscript—the irreversible decision point occurs at 'She signed
        her name at the bottom of the advertisement—not her father's name, not a pseudonym,
        but her own.' This is the point of no return.
      act_2_opening: The final paragraphs ('Outside, the fog thickened...') establish
        the new world of rising action where Eleanor is now a publisher with enemies,
        calculating logistics and consequences. Act 2 clearly begins with 'The threshold
        was crossed.'
    must_include_elements:
      1_decision_to_publish: 'Present—Eleanor explicitly decides to publish: ''If
        we publish this...We print on Friday.'''
      2_central_conflict: 'Present—Profit vs. ethics/danger is the core tension throughout:
        ''It would sell ten thousand copies...It was sensational. Irresponsible. Potentially
        libelous.'' and Thomas''s warning about powerful men.'
      3_defying_victorian_expectations: 'Present—Eleanor stepping into publisher role
        as a woman: ''Every editor in the city will know it was my decision'' and
        signing her own name rather than using a pseudonym.'
      4_thomas_chen_as_ally: 'Present—Thomas is established as key ally with his own
        stake: ''If Blackwood & Sons failed, no other printing house would hire him
        for anything beyond menial labor.'''
      5_hint_of_danger: 'Present—Multiple hints: Thomas''s warning about ''powerful
        men'' and ''connections to powerful men,'' the threat to her address, and
        the implicit danger from those implicated in the manuscript.'
      6_threshold_crossing: 'Present—Explicitly stated: ''The threshold was crossed.
        There would be no going back.'' Eleanor cannot undo her decision.'
    must_not_elements:
      1_ripper_appearance: Successfully avoided—The killer never appears as a character.
      2_graphic_violence: Successfully avoided—No graphic descriptions of murders
        or violence.
      3_romantic_subplot: Successfully avoided—Relationship between Eleanor and Thomas
        remains professional and respectful.
      4_easy_solution: Successfully avoided—Financial problems remain unresolved;
        publishing is a gamble, not a guaranteed fix.
    tone_assessment: Excellent execution of gothic tension and Victorian atmosphere.
      The fog imagery ('Fog pressed against the glass like something alive, hungry'),
      the candlelit study, and the midnight bell create strong gothic mood. Feminist
      undertones are woven throughout Eleanor's internal conflict and her deliberate
      choice to sign her own name. Minor deduction only because the tone could have
      been slightly darker in the opening, though this is a very minor point.
    ending_assessment: Perfect execution. Eleanor is fully committed to the dangerous
      path, Act 2 is clearly begun with rising action and complications ahead. The
      final line 'she was already calculating print runs, distribution routes, the
      mathematics of survival' shows her active engagement in the new world. The threshold
      crossing is explicit and irreversible.
