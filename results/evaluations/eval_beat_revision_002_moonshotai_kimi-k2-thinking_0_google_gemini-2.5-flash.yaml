  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true ''All Is Lost'' moment. It addressed all aspects of the flaw: the fundraiser
    is now ''pointless'', the grant is revealed as failed due to Denise''s error,
    Denise herself leaves and betrays Marcus, the board pulls support, and his wife''s
    text indicates personal loss/betrayal. Marcus explicitly gives up hope (''nothing
    left to fight with'', ''couldn''t see a way forward''). The ''whiff of death''
    is present in the metaphorical loss of his identity/purpose and the crumbling
    of his marriage. The changes, while significant to achieve the beat, were focused
    and built upon the existing structure, rather than a complete rewrite. All required
    preserved phrases and elements are present.'
