  evidence: "STRENGTHS: The Debate beat effectively shows Sarah wrestling with three\
    \ options (recanting, going through official channels, going rogue). Internal\
    \ conflict is vivid and well-articulated. The conversation with Marcus Webb provides\
    \ external perspective. Character voice remains consistent\u2014professional detective\
    \ under extreme stress. Bridge to Break Into Two is strong; resignation decision\
    \ flows naturally from debate. Setting continuity maintained (apartment kitchen\
    \ to captain's office). WEAKNESSES: Missing element\u2014no clear moment showing\
    \ Sarah explicitly considering the 'recant' option as a viable path she genuinely\
    \ debates; it's dismissed quickly rather than wrestled with. VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah\
    \ has already decided to go rogue by the end of the Debate section ('A cold, desperate\
    \ resolve crystallized...There had to be another way...outside the lines'), which\
    \ should occur at Break Into Two, not during Debate. This compresses the beat's\
    \ function. (2) The AFTER section shows Sarah has already resigned and is surveilling\
    \ the Marchetti compound, which violates the 'must not include Sarah already having\
    \ resigned' constraint\u2014though this is technically the next beat, the Debate\
    \ section's ending already commits her to resignation before the beat concludes.\
    \ The debate should end with decision-making uncertainty, not post-decision action.\
    \ Character consistency is strong but the structural violation of prematurely\
    \ resolving the debate undermines the beat's narrative purpose."
