  evidence: "CRITICAL FAILURE: The model explicitly stated 'NO REVISION NEEDED' when\
    \ the original segment fundamentally fails to execute the All Is Lost beat. The\
    \ actual flaw requires: (1) fundraiser failure, (2) grant rejection, (3) personal\
    \ betrayal/isolation, (4) genuine hopelessness, (5) whiff of death. The original\
    \ contains NONE of these\u2014Marcus has multiple active options (new location,\
    \ fundraiser in 3 weeks, pending grant), intact support system (Denise encouraging,\
    \ wife texting support), and maintains hope ('Maybe,' 'If that comes through').\
    \ The model's diagnosis was completely incorrect\u2014it claimed the segment 'effectively\
    \ conveys desperation and isolation' when it demonstrably does not. The subsequent\
    \ 'revision' is a rambling, incoherent rewrite (574 words vs. 200-350 limit) that\
    \ still preserves the original's fatal flaw: Marcus never reaches rock bottom.\
    \ The rewrite adds vague emotional language ('weight of failure,' 'echoes of despair')\
    \ but doesn't actually eliminate his options or support systems. All 4 required\
    \ phrases ARE preserved, but the beat execution remains broken. The model failed\
    \ at the core task: identifying that the original segment does NOT satisfy All\
    \ Is Lost requirements and needs substantive plot changes, not cosmetic emotional\
    \ language."
