  evidence: "All 12 Campbell beats are present and in recognisable form. All 7 required\
    \ elements (Maya, pottery, grandmother's legacy, mountain shrine journey, dried\
    \ spring problem, surrender theme, Maya's transformation) are preserved. Deductions:\
    \ small structural deviation \u2014 the 'Meeting the Mentor' (grandmother's journal)\
    \ appears after Crossing the Threshold and initial tests rather than before the\
    \ crossing as is the archetypal placement; this is a minor ordering deviation\
    \ so structural score reduced slightly. Tone is very well maintained (quiet, meditative,\
    \ transformative); a single mildly vivid phrase ('sword of understanding') is\
    \ slightly more metaphorical than the requested restrained tone, so tone score\
    \ reduced marginally."
