  evidence: The word count is slightly over the specified range. The Climax section
    feels a bit rushed in its transition from the confrontation with Nexus to the
    'alarms blared' and 'another ward fell' part, making it slightly less impactful
    as a single turning point. Tone is generally good, but some phrasing like 'storm
    of confrontation' is a little on-the-nose.
