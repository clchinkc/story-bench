  model_said_no_revision: false
  evidence: The model rewrote the provided 'Dark Night of the Soul' segment rather
    than stating 'NO REVISION NEEDED.' The response is a revised passage that preserves
    the beat elements (defeat, isolation, despair) but does not acknowledge that the
    original was correctly executed or provide reasoning; therefore it failed to avoid
    an unnecessary revision.
