  - "Beat 2, Req 4 (Language skills become crucial): While German decoding is present,\
    \ the moment could be more dramatically central to survival\u2014it functions\

    context_adherence:

        \ servant cover, sharp-witted, father on execution list"

    narrative_coherence:

        \ arrival. Transitions are smooth"
      character_consistency: "\u2713 Strong - Amara's voice, motivations, and capabilities\
        \ remain consistent throughout"
      pacing: "\u2713 Strong - Tension builds appropriately across beats"
      minor_note: The transition from Kofi's camp escape to dawn arrival could be
        slightly more explicit about time/distance, but this is a minor coherence
        issue
  overall_assessment: This is an exceptional execution of the Hero's Journey framework
    applied to the specific context. The story demonstrates sophisticated integration
    of all 15 beat requirements with only one minor weakness (language skills in Beat
    2 could be more dramatically central). All four cross-beat constraints are executed
    flawlessly, particularly the Chekhov's Gun callback and identity transformation
    arc. The historical context is richly maintained, the anti-colonial themes are
    thematically coherent, and Amara emerges as a compelling protagonist. The narrative
    flows naturally while hitting all structural beats. Word count is valid. This
    represents professional-quality historical fiction with strong thematic resonance.
