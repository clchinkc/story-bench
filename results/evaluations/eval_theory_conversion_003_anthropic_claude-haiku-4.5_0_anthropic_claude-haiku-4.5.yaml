  evidence: 'All four target beats are clearly present: Act 1 Setup establishes Kenji''s
    loss and introduces the wedding invitation (Ordinary World + Inciting Incident
    + First Plot Point); Act 2A shows his arrival in Kyoto, meeting Haruki, and bonding
    with Yuki through wedding prep (Rising Action with obstacles of awkwardness and
    distance); Act 2B introduces the Tokyo business call temptation and Yuki''s rejection
    (Complications + Second Plot Point); Act 3 delivers the climax (Kenji declining
    the deal and apologizing) and denouement (the bamboo shop ending). All 8 core
    elements preserved: Kenji protagonist, lost career, estranged Yuki, Kyoto wedding,
    Haruki craftsman, business temptation, theme of people over ambition, bamboo shop
    conclusion. Structure follows Aristotle/Field theory with clear three-act progression
    and proper plot point placement. Tone is consistently quiet, meditative, and redemptive
    with strong Japanese aesthetic (rice terraces, bamboo weaving, temple, tea ceremony).
    Minor deduction (0.05) for structural accuracy: the Act 2A/2B division could be
    slightly more pronounced—the midpoint transition is subtle rather than emphatic.
    Minor tone deduction (0.05): one phrase (''intoxicated him with possibility'')
    slightly breaks the understated aesthetic, though it recovers immediately.'
