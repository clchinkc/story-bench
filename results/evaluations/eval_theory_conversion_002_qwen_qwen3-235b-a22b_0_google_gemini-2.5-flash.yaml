  evidence: Missing 'Meeting the Mentor' as the journal is found later, not a direct
    meeting. 'Allies' and 'Enemies' are not explicitly present as distinct beats,
    though internal conflict serves a similar purpose to 'Enemies'. The 'Reward' is
    not explicitly 'Seizing the Sword' but rather the knowledge/vessel itself. The
    'Resurrection' beat is somewhat merged with the 'Return with Elixir' as the spring's
    return is the final act, not a separate 'death and rebirth' moment for Maya before
    the return. The structure is mostly followed, but some beats are less distinct
    or slightly out of order compared to a strict interpretation of the 12 stages.
