  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The
    Ordeal as a mere boss battle and not a transformative crisis. It addressed all
    four points of the actual flaw: (1) The dragon exploited Kira''s guilt over her
    brother''s death, (2) there was a clear ''death'' moment where she accepted failure/unworthiness,
    (3) a rebirth/transformation occurred with new understanding, and (4) victory
    came from this new insight. The changes were significant enough to fix the flaw
    but still preserved much of the original structure and key phrases, indicating
    a good balance of revision and preservation.'
