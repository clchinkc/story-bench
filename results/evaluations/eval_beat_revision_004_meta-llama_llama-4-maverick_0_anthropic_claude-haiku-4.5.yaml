  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw (telling vs.\
    \ showing) and attempted to shift from summary to scene-based exposition. It recognized\
    \ the need for sensory details, action, and character behavior. However, the diagnosis\
    \ is incomplete\u2014the model didn't fully grasp that the original was an info-dump\
    \ that needed to be restructured into a SINGLE COHERENT SCENE, not a patchwork\
    \ of scene fragments plus retained summary. FLAW CORRECTION: Partially fixed.\
    \ The revision DOES show Rachel arriving at work, interacting with James, and\
    \ scanning reports\u2014this is genuine showing. However, it then REVERTS to telling:\
    \ 'At home, her cat, Sherlock, waited patiently...' and 'Rachel had found him\
    \ at a crime scene two years ago...' and 'her career having taken precedence over\
    \ personal life after a brief, failed engagement years ago.' These are still info-dumps,\
    \ just repositioned. The revision mixes scene with summary rather than fully committing\
    \ to scene-based exposition. BEAT SATISFACTION: The opening (Rachel at precinct)\
    \ executes exposition well\u2014setting, character behavior, relationship shown\
    \ through dialogue. But the middle section collapses back into telling, undermining\
    \ the beat. The final line ('The calm was about to be shattered') is a weak attempt\
    \ at foreshadowing that doesn't belong in pure exposition. PRESERVATION: All 5\
    \ elements preserved (Rachel Torres, James Oyelaran, Sherlock, Queens apartment,\
    \ October Tuesday). All 4 required phrases present. MINIMAL CHANGE: NOT minimal.\
    \ The revision is a substantial restructure\u2014it reorganizes paragraphs, adds\
    \ new scene action (coffee, walking, nodding), and interleaves home/work narrative.\
    \ This is moderate-to-significant revision, not surgical editing. The model essentially\
    \ rewrote rather than minimally fixed. QUALITY: Writing is competent with good\
    \ sensory details in the opening (black coffee, jazz, fluorescent lights). No\
    \ grammatical errors. However, the tonal shift mid-revision (scene to summary)\
    \ creates awkward pacing. The phrase 'The calm was about to be shattered' is clich\xE9\
    d and premature for exposition."
error: null
