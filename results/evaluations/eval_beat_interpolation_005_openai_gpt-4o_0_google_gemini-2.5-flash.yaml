  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. Maya discovers Alejandro's
    vulnerability through his story about his mother and paella. Their relationship
    clearly shifts from professional to personal, marked by shared vulnerability and
    connection. The shared meal creates a genuine connection. Maya makes a clear choice
    to deepen her commitment beyond the contract, stating 'I’m staying. For as long
    as you’ll have me.' All 'must not' items were successfully avoided. Character
    consistency, bridging between beats, and continuity are all excellent.
