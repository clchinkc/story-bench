  failed_items:
  - Beat 1 - 'Things going according to plan (mostly)' is undermined; the pressure-sensitive
    floor tiles appear as a genuine threat rather than a minor complication that the
    crew handles smoothly. The beat lacks a sense of controlled execution.
  - Cross-beat constraint - 'Chekhov's Gun' is only partially satisfied. The pressure-sensitive
    floor tiles are introduced as a complication in Beat 1, but their payoff in Beat
    3 (Anya crossing them) feels underdeveloped. The setup doesn't clearly establish
    this as a planned solution; it reads more as improvisation than a traced setup-to-payoff.
  - 'Word count requirement not met: 503 words vs. required 700-1000 words. The narrative
    is compressed, leaving insufficient room to fully develop crew dynamics and mentor
    escalation across beats.'
  strengths:
  - 'Beat 1 (Fun and Games): Excellent execution of heist action with specific, vivid
    details (Javier''s champagne distraction, Anya''s air duct traverse, Leo''s thermal
    overlay). Clever problem-solving is evident throughout.'
  - 'Beat 2 (Midpoint): False victory is cleanly achieved (painting swapped), and
    Thorne''s reveal via security monitor is dramatically effective. Stakes escalate
    sharply with lockdown and Leo''s compromise.'
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In): Security actively closing in, Leo in danger, Miri''s
    choice between revenge and loyalty is clear and character-defining. Gallows humor
    (''remind me to pack a parachute'') marks tonal shift.'
  - 'Tonal Escalation: Successfully shifts from playful confidence (''Carelessly,''
    Anya''s ''hopscotch for felons'') through shaken confidence (Thorne''s reveal)
    to genuine danger (alarms, lockdown, Leo''s vitals spiking).'
  - 'Mentor Presence: Thorne''s arc is well-calibrated—background threat (Beat 1),
    shocking reveal (Beat 2), active antagonist (Beat 3). Her dialogue (''Still sentimental
    about strays?'') is menacing.'
  - 'Context Maintenance: Protagonist voice is sharp and consistent. Monaco/yacht
    setting is vivid. Ocean''s Eleven tone with art history stakes is well-balanced.'
  - 'Leo''s Arc: Provides consistent crew member thread—competent hacker (Beat 1)
    → compromised/panicked (Beat 2-3) → affects plot by forcing Miri''s moral choice.'
  weaknesses:
  - Insufficient word count severely limits development. Beat 1 needs more breathing
    room to establish crew competence before complications. Beat 2's false victory
    feels rushed. Beat 3 lacks space for team friction or deeper exploration of Miri's
    internal conflict.
  - Chekhov's Gun setup is weak. The pressure-sensitive floor tiles are introduced
    as a problem Leo didn't anticipate, not as a planned element. When Anya uses them
    in Beat 3, it reads as lucky improvisation rather than clever foreshadowing.
  - Team friction/trust issues (Beat 3 requirement) are minimal. Javier's 'We need
    to bolt!' is the only hint of disagreement. More tension between crew members
    would strengthen the beat.
  - Miri's choice between painting and revenge could be more agonized. Her decision
    to pursue Leo is correct but feels somewhat inevitable given her character. The
    internal struggle deserves more weight.
  - The yacht lockdown mechanism is effective but could be more specific. How does
    Thorne seal the exits? What are the physical/technical details that make escape
    genuinely difficult?
  calibration_notes: 'This is a strong narrative that executes the core heist beats
    with style and momentum. The primary penalty is word count (503 vs. 700-1000),
    which prevents fuller development of required elements. The Chekhov''s Gun constraint
    is only partially met because the setup (pressure tiles as obstacle) doesn''t
    clearly telegraph the payoff (Anya crossing them as solution). Despite these gaps,
    the story demonstrates clear understanding of Save the Cat structure, maintains
    tone escalation, and delivers on character arcs. Score reflects: excellent beat
    execution (0.87) offset by incomplete cross-beat constraint satisfaction (0.75)
    and word count failure.'
