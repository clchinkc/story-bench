  evidence: 'All four three-act beats are present: Act I (ordinary world, inciting
    letter, first plot point = train departure), Act IIa (reconnection, Haruki, festival;
    midpoint = temptation/offer), Act IIb (complication: Yuki''s discovery, ''all
    is lost''; second plot point = declining the deal), Act III (climax outside the
    wedding, denouement = bamboo shop). All eight required elements are preserved
    intact. Deductions: word count falls outside requested 550–750 range (given 868).
    Minor structural deduction for slight ambiguity about which moment functions as
    a clean midpoint (temptation is present but not sharply framed as a reversible
    midpoint), and a very small tone deduction for a few explicit explanatory lines
    that lightly reduce the subtlety of the requested quiet, Japanese aesthetic.'
