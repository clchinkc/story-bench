  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Sarah considers recanting, she
    contacts authorities (Marcus) and discusses official protection, she wrestles
    with duty vs. saving her sister, and a conversation plus the act of pulling case
    files pushes her toward a third option. No forbidden elements appear. Minor deduction
    for continuity: the Debate references ''seventy-two hours'' while the After mentions
    ''seventy hours'' (small inconsistency). Otherwise voice, pacing, and transition
    to the Break into Two are strong.'
