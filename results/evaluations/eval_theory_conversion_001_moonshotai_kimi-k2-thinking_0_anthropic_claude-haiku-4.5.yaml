  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All five Freytag beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Exposition establishes Samira''s 15-year reputation and the impossible virus discovery.
    Rising Action spans the 72-hour containment crisis with escalating patient numbers
    and adaptive pathogen behavior. Climax occurs at the revelation of Nexus Biotech''s
    involvement and the confrontation with corporate lawyers—the highest tension point
    where Samira faces the choice between career and conscience. Falling Action depicts
    the press conference, simultaneous media/journal uploads, and real-time corporate
    collapse. Denouement provides new equilibrium: Samira unemployable but at peace,
    millions saved, Nexus indicted. All six core elements preserved: protagonist (Samira),
    engineered virus, Raj (supporting), Nexus (antagonist), public cure release, career
    sacrifice. Tone maintains medical thriller tension throughout with ethical weight
    in the climax and resolution. MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Structural accuracy slightly reduced
    (0.9 vs 1.0) because the transition between Rising Action and Climax could be
    more explicitly marked—the Nexus revelation feels slightly compressed relative
    to the buildup. Tone score at 0.95 (not 1.0) because the denouement''s philosophical
    reflection, while appropriate, slightly softens the thriller tension compared
    to the source material''s more ambiguous ending. Word count valid at 574 words
    (within 500-700 range).'
