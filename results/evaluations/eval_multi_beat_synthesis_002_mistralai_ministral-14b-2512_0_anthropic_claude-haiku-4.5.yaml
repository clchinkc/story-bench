        note: Final obstacle is underdeveloped—British pursuit is mentioned but not

  cross_beat_analysis:
    chekhovs_gun:
      satisfied: true
      evidence: Amara's literacy and language skills (demonstrated in Beat 1 with
        English/German/local languages) become essential in Beat 2 (reading maps,
        understanding British) and Beat 3 (reading the letter, understanding British
        commands). Maps from pouch directly enable navigation.
    identity_transformation:
      satisfied: true
      evidence: 'Beat 1: ''practiced ease of a servant,'' head lowered. Beat 2: ''You''re
        not just a girl with laundry anymore.'' Beat 3: ''She was not a servant. She
        was not a girl. She was the resistance.'' Clear arc of self-perception.'
    escalating_danger:
      satisfied: true
      evidence: 'Beat 1: Risk of discovery while leaving (drunken voices, need to
        hide). Beat 2: Direct confrontation with armed British soldiers who search
        her basket. Beat 3: Active pursuit—''The British had reached the edge of the
        forest. Their voices were sharp.'''
    thematic_thread_knowledge_as_resistance:
      satisfied: false
      evidence: Present in Beats 1-2 (reading English, understanding languages, reading
        maps). However, in Beat 3, this theme becomes abstract rather than concrete.
        The story doesn't show Amara *using* her knowledge to overcome the final obstacle—it
        ends with her steeling herself rather than demonstrating how literacy/languages
        enable her to resist or survive the British pursuit.
      gap: Beat 3 should show Amara using her linguistic/literacy skills to evade
        or outmaneuver the British, not just declaring her readiness

    issues:
    - Ending feels abrupt—Amara reaches Yaa but then suddenly British are at forest
      edge. Transition unclear.
    - Beat 3 lacks a concrete dramatized obstacle; instead of showing Amara overcome
      something, it tells us she's ready.
    - The revelation that her father was already captured (two nights ago) is powerful
      but underexplored—no time for Amara to process or respond emotionally before
      story ends.
  failed_items:
  - 'WORD COUNT: 2651 words exceeds maximum of 1000 by 165% (requirement: 700-1000
    words)'
  - 'BEAT 2 - Learn about resistance: Amara learns Yaa''s name and location but not
    substantive information about resistance structure, strategy, or goals'
  - 'BEAT 3 - Final obstacle dramatization: British pursuit is mentioned but not shown
    as a concrete obstacle Amara must actively overcome before reaching stronghold'
  - 'CROSS-BEAT THEMATIC THREAD: Knowledge-as-resistance theme becomes abstract in
    Beat 3; doesn''t show Amara using literacy/languages to overcome final obstacle,
    only declaring readiness'
  - 'COHERENCE: Ending transition is abrupt—unclear how Amara moves from meeting Yaa
    to British suddenly at forest edge; no dramatized escape or evasion'
  strengths:
  - Exceptional character voice and internal consistency
  - Strong anti-colonial perspective and historical authenticity
  - Excellent use of sensory detail and atmospheric tension
  - Clear identity transformation arc across all three beats
  - Chekhov's Gun perfectly executed with maps and language skills
  - Escalating danger well-paced through all beats
  - Amara's wit and intelligence shine throughout
  recommendations:
  - CUT approximately 1,650 words to meet 700-1000 range; prioritize tightening Beat
    3
  - 'In Beat 2: Add one line where resistance member reveals something about their
    strategy or goals (e.g., ''We''re moving the leaders north, but the British know
    the main routes'')'
  - 'In Beat 3: Dramatize the final obstacle—show Amara using her language skills
    or map-reading to evade British pursuit, not just declare readiness'
  - 'Revise ending: Either show Amara successfully evading British and entering stronghold,
    OR end at moment of capture/confrontation with higher stakes'
  - 'Add emotional beat: Amara''s reaction to learning her father was already captured—this
    is major and deserves processing time'
