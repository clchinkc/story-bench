  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 2, Req 5 (learns something about resistance she didn''t know): The revelation
    about burned villages and the scorched-earth policy is present, but it''s relatively
    brief and doesn''t deeply shift her understanding of the resistance movement''s
    scale or strategy—it''s more confirmation of danger than new intelligence about
    the organization itself.'
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional execution of Chekhov''s Gun: Amara''s language skills (German, Twi,
    pidgin English, Fante) demonstrated throughout Beat 1 become the decisive factor
    in Beat 3, where her German literacy unmasks the false patrol.'
  - 'Flawless identity transformation arc: Beat 1 shows her as cautious servant (''submissive
    Fante''), Beat 2 reveals capability (''thief of secrets''), Beat 3 fully claims
    resistance fighter role (''arrived...as a weapon'').'
  - 'Escalating danger perfectly calibrated: Beat 1 (discovery risk/checkpoint), Beat
    2 (direct rifle fire/active pursuit), Beat 3 (surrounded patrol/imminent capture
    at stronghold).'
  - 'Knowledge-as-resistance theme woven throughout all three beats: servant''s knowledge
    of routines (Beat 1), coded phrases and dialect switching (Beat 2), decoding German
    signals (Beat 3).'
  - Rich historical detail and authentic colonial atmosphere maintained throughout.
  - Narrative tension builds organically; pacing is excellent.
  - Character voice is distinctive and compelling; internal monologue reveals psychological
    depth.
  - All five Beat 1 requirements fully satisfied with sophistication.
  - All five Beat 3 requirements fully satisfied; the final obstacle is thematically
    resonant.
  minor_weaknesses:
  - 'Beat 2, Req 5 could be strengthened: The intelligence about burned villages and
    relocated camps is valuable but feels more like confirmation of existing danger
    than a revelation that fundamentally reframes her understanding of the resistance
    network''s structure, scale, or strategy.'
  - Kofi's character could have slightly more depth as an ally—his motivations remain
    somewhat opaque, though this ambiguity is narratively effective.
  overall_assessment: This is a professionally executed historical adventure narrative
    that demonstrates sophisticated understanding of the Hero's Journey framework.
    The story seamlessly integrates all cross-beat constraints, with particular excellence
    in the Chekhov's Gun payoff and identity transformation. The protagonist's agency,
    intelligence, and moral clarity are compelling. The anti-colonial themes are woven
    naturally into the plot rather than imposed. The only minor gap is that one Beat
    2 requirement could have more narrative weight, but this is a marginal issue in
    an otherwise exceptional piece.
