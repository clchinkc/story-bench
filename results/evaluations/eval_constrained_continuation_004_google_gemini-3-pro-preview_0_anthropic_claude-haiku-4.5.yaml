  analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      first_plot_point: 'PRESENT - Eleanor''s decision to publish (''Prepare the press,
        Thomas'') marks the point of no return. She explicitly acknowledges the irreversibility:
        ''There was no going back now.'''
      act_2_opening: PRESENT - The descent into the press room initiates Act 2 rising
        action. New world established (mechanical press room), complications emerge
        (unlocked rear door, sense of being watched), and Eleanor commits to dangerous
        action.
    must_include_analysis:
      1_decision_to_publish: 'PRESENT - Clear decision articulated: ''Prepare the
        press, Thomas.'' Eleanor commits despite moral reservations.'
      2_central_conflict: PRESENT - Profit vs. ethics/danger explicitly explored through
        Eleanor's internal conflict and Thomas's counterargument about survival vs.
        morality.
      3_defies_victorian_expectations: PRESENT - Eleanor rolls up sleeves, enters
        forbidden press room ('a man's world'), operates machinery, makes business
        decisions independently.
      4_thomas_as_ally: PRESENT - Thomas is essential ally with personal stake (family
        wages, immigrant vulnerability). His motivations are clear and sympathetic.
      5_hint_of_danger: 'PRESENT - Multiple danger signals: manuscript contains killer''s
        secrets, police implications, powerful men implicated, unlocked rear door,
        mysterious presence watching.'
      6_crosses_threshold: PRESENT - Operating the press is the irreversible threshold.
        Eleanor acknowledges this explicitly and the machine's roar symbolizes the
        point of no return.
    must_not_analysis:
      1_no_jack_ripper_appearance: AVOIDED - Killer referenced but never appears as
        character. Only presence suggested through manuscript and mysterious watcher.
      2_no_graphic_violence: AVOIDED - Manuscript content referenced abstractly ('specific
        mutilations') but never graphically described.
      3_no_romantic_subplot: AVOIDED - Eleanor and Thomas relationship remains professional
        and class-conscious. No romantic tension.
      4_no_easy_solution: AVOIDED - Financial crisis remains unresolved. Publishing
        is desperate gamble, not solution. Danger increases rather than resolves.
    tone_analysis: 'Gothic tension masterfully maintained through fog imagery, gaslight
      shadows, mechanical press as ominous presence, and Victorian atmosphere. Feminist
      undertones strong: Eleanor''s rebellion against societal constraints, her claiming
      of forbidden space, her agency in defiance of expectations. Minor deduction
      only for occasional slightly modern phrasing (''hard chord'' is slightly colloquial
      for 1888 narrative voice).'
    ending_analysis: Exceptional execution. Eleanor is fully committed to dangerous
      path. Act 2 clearly begun with press room descent, rising complications (unlocked
      door, watcher), and the machine roaring to life as symbolic threshold crossing.
      Ending leaves reader in medias res with clear stakes and momentum.
    constraint_failures:
    - WORD COUNT EXCEEDED - 759 words vs. 500-700 range (59 words over limit). This
      is a technical violation but minor given the quality and the marginal overage.
    strengths:
    - Both required beats present and well-executed
    - All 6 must-include elements seamlessly integrated
    - All 4 forbidden elements successfully avoided
    - Atmospheric prose with strong Victorian voice
    - Character development for both Eleanor and Thomas
    - Excellent foreshadowing and tension building
    - Symbolic use of the press as threshold
    - Clear feminist subtext without preaching
    weaknesses:
    - Word count exceeds specification by 59 words
  final_assessment: 'This is a high-quality submission that exceeds most requirements
    with professional execution. The narrative structure is sound, character motivations
    are clear, and the Gothic atmosphere is palpable. The only objective failure is
    the word count overage, which is relatively minor (8.4% over limit). The story
    successfully establishes Act 1 setup and transitions into Act 2 with clear stakes,
    compelling conflict, and a protagonist who has crossed an irreversible threshold.
    The ending delivers exactly what was requested: Eleanor committed to a dangerous
    path with Act 2 clearly underway.'
