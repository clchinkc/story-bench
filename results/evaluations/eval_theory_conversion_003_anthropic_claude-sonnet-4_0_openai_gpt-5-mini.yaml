  evidence: "All four three-act beats are present: Act I establishes the ordinary\
    \ world and inciting incident (the letter) and ends with the first plot point\
    \ (Kenji boards the train); Act II shows a clear first-half (adjusting to village\
    \ life, meeting Haruki, emotional midpoint of seeing Yuki whole) and second-half\
    \ complications (rivals' offer and Yuki's rejection) that push to Act III; Act\
    \ III resolves with Kenji's choice, the wedding denouement, and the shop epilogue.\
    \ All eight required elements are retained. Small deductions: the conversion could\
    \ more explicitly signpost the midpoint and the second plot point (they are present\
    \ but somewhat implicit), hence a slight reduction in structural_accuracy_score;\
    \ tone is very well maintained with only a minimal deduction for occasional directness\
    \ in phrasing compared to a consistently spare Japanese aesthetic. Word count\
    \ is invalid per the given range (the piece is 539 words; required 550\u2013750)."
