  evidence: All required elements are present and executed well. The 'must not' conditions
    are all avoided. The characters remain consistent with their established personalities,
    and the bridge between the previous and subsequent beats is seamless. The narrative
    clearly functions as an Act 2 Midpoint, showing a shift in Maya's commitment and
    the deepening of their relationship.
