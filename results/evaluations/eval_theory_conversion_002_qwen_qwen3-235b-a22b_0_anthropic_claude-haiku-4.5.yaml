  evidence: "BEATS ANALYSIS: Present (11/12): Ordinary World (pottery workshop opening),\
    \ Call to Adventure (dried spring, elders' request), Refusal of Call (hesitation\
    \ at forest edge, self-doubt), Meeting the Mentor (grandmother's journal discovered),\
    \ Crossing Threshold (entering shrine's heart, fasting begins), Tests/Allies/Enemies\
    \ (three days of fasting, internal doubts as antagonists, journal as ally), Approach\
    \ to Inmost Cave (kneading clay, preparing for creation), Ordeal (four-night transformation,\
    \ surrender process), Reward/Seizing Sword (vessel emerges, spring flows), Road\
    \ Back (descent with jar, doubts resurface), Resurrection (pouring seawater, spring\
    \ awakens fully). MISSING: Return with Elixir is ambiguous\u2014the final paragraph\
    \ hints at transformation but doesn't clearly show how Maya brings wisdom back\
    \ to the community in concrete, actionable form. The elixir (surrender philosophy)\
    \ remains internal rather than externalized. PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact\u2014\
    Maya (protagonist), pottery (central), grandmother's legacy (journal, ghost, laughter),\
    \ mountain shrine (detailed ruins), dried spring (catalyst and resolution), surrender\
    \ theme (pervasive), transformation (evident). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Conversion\
    \ successfully maps Story Circle's circular structure onto Hero's Journey's linear\
    \ progression. However, the compressed word count (498 vs. 600-800 required) forces\
    \ some beats to overlap or compress, reducing clarity of distinct stages. The\
    \ meditative prose prioritizes tone over beat delineation. TONE: Exceptional\u2014\
    quiet, introspective, lyrical language ('clay speaks,' 'song not singer,' 'salt\
    \ and hope mingling') maintains meditative quality throughout. Sensory details\
    \ and internal monologue reinforce transformative arc. DEDUCTION: -0.08 structural\
    \ accuracy for missing/unclear Elixir return; -0.05 tone for minor variance in\
    \ final section's philosophical density."
