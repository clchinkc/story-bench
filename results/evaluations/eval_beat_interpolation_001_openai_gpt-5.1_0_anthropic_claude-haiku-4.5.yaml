  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All four required elements present and well-executed: (1)
    Marcus introduced as established mentor figure with credibility (''grey at the
    temples'', owns curiosity shop, knows about Thornwood); (2) Practical wisdom provided
    (''forest tests intentions, not abilities'', ''Trust what you know'') plus tangible
    tools (satchel, compass); (3) Elena''s doubt shifts convincingly from ''I can''t
    do this'' to reluctant acceptance (''Fear hadn''t lessened, but it had shifted'');
    (4) Librarian skills reframed as asset (''navigate labyrinths of information'',
    ''see patterns'', ''ask better questions''). All must-not items avoided: Elena
    remains doubtful/reluctant, Marcus explicitly refuses to accompany her, setting
    is kitchen/shop (not forest), no magical powers discovered. Character voice consistent—Elena''s
    internal conflict and practical nature maintained throughout. Bridge between beats
    seamless: BEFORE shows refusal, GENERATED shows mentor encounter shifting perspective,
    AFTER shows threshold crossing. Continuity perfect: same map, same satchel, same
    compass, same emotional arc. DEDUCTION: Word count (572) significantly exceeds
    350-word maximum by 63%, violating explicit constraint. This is a material structural
    violation despite excellent narrative quality.'
