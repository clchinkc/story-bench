  evidence: All required elements are present and executed well. The 'Search' beat's
    function is clearly met through Yuki's exploration, discovery of clues, encounter
    with the shimmer-forms, and overcoming the sealed medical bay. All 'must not'
    items were successfully avoided. Character and continuity are consistent, and
    the bridge between beats is strong.
