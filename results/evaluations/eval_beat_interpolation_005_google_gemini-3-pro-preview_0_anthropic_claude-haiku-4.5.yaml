  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All four required elements are present and well-executed.
    (1) Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability through his emotional response to
    the rice pudding and his confession about commodification and lost identity. (2)
    Relationship shifts from purely professional (90 days of minimal interaction,
    critiques only) to genuinely personal (he opens up, laughs, thanks her beyond
    the job). (3) The shared moment is the rice pudding scene—intimate without being
    romantic, creating authentic connection through food and vulnerability. (4) Maya''s
    commitment deepens beyond contract when she realizes ''The debt, the restaurant,
    the salary—they suddenly felt secondary'' and she''s now ''guarding him'' rather
    than guarding a paycheck. All must-not items are avoided: they are not in love
    or overly intimate (forehead touch comes later in the AFTER section), Maya doesn''t
    decide to leave, the photograph isn''t taken during this scene, and Alejandro''s
    wall is explicitly lowered (''the steel wall behind his eyes was gone''). Character
    consistency is strong—Maya remains compassionate and perceptive, Alejandro''s
    arc from cold to vulnerable is earned and believable. The bridge between BEFORE
    and AFTER is seamless: this midpoint establishes the emotional stakes that make
    the photograph scandal devastating. Setting continuity is perfect—kitchen location,
    time of night, physical details all cohere. The beat executes its narrative function
    precisely: it''s the point where Maya commits emotionally and the relationship
    becomes about more than money.'
