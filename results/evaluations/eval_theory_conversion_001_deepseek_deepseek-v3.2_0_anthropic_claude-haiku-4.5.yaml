  evidence: 'All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-delineated: Exposition
    establishes Samira''s 15-year reputation and orderly world; Rising Action escalates
    through containment, evolving pathogen, and discovery of Nexus connection; Climax
    converges proof with corporate confrontation and legal threats; Falling Action
    executes the press conference strategy and cure release; Denouement settles into
    new equilibrium with investigation ongoing and Samira''s career sacrificed but
    conscience clear. All 6 core elements preserved: protagonist (Samira), engineered
    virus, Raj (supporting), Nexus (antagonist), public cure release, career sacrifice.
    Structure transitions are explicit and logical. Tone maintains medical thriller
    tension throughout with ethical weight in the denouement reflection. Minor deduction
    (0.05) for structural accuracy: the climax description blends revelation and confrontation
    slightly abstractly (''fused into one high point'') rather than pinpointing a
    single turning point moment, though this is narratively effective. Minor deduction
    (0.05) for tone: the denouement''s philosophical reflection (''she was unemployable,
    and she was free'') slightly softens the thriller tension, though this appropriately
    signals genre shift to resolution phase.'
