  evidence: "REQUIRED ELEMENTS (4/4 present): (1) Multiple station areas explored\u2014\
    crew quarters, medical bay, corridors, Lab Seven referenced; (2) Clues discovered\u2014\
    scattered belongings, half-eaten meals, patient files showing temporal displacement\
    \ episodes, Dr. Chen's incomplete log about dimensional barriers and quantum superposition;\
    \ (3) Transformed crew encounter\u2014shadows with multi-dimensional fingers,\
    \ whispers, temperature drop, entities attempting to pull her into fractured existence;\
    \ (4) Obstacle overcome\u2014plasma torch used to scatter shadows and create escape\
    \ route. MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS (0/4): No immediate data core discovery (found in\
    \ AFTER beat), transformed crew don't explain everything (only fragmented whispers\
    \ and 'help us'), Yuki doesn't abandon mission (continues searching), dimensional\
    \ transformation is mystery to discover (not pre-known). EXECUTION: Perfectly\
    \ executes Search beat\u2014active exploration, incremental discovery, escalating\
    \ tension, adaptation through problem-solving. CHARACTER: Yuki maintains consistent\
    \ voice\u2014scientific curiosity, tactical thinking, fear response proportional\
    \ to threat. BRIDGE: Seamless transition from Go (arrival) to Search (investigation)\
    \ to Find (data core location). CONTINUITY: Setting details align perfectly\u2014\
    emergency lighting established, life support functioning, crew quarters state,\
    \ medical bay location, Lab Seven destination all coherent."
