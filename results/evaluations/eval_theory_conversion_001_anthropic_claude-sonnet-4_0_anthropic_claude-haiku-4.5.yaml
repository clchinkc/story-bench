  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All five Freytag beats are clearly present and well-executed.
    Exposition establishes Samira''s world of certainty and routine before disruption.
    Rising Action escalates through 72-hour chaos, failed experiments, and mounting
    pressure. Climax peaks at the Nexus revelation and threatening phone call—the
    highest tension point where stakes crystallize. Falling Action executes the press
    conference strategy and its immediate consequences. Denouement provides new equilibrium
    in the independent clinic with thematic resolution. All 6 core elements preserved:
    protagonist (Samira), engineered virus discovery, Raj present throughout, Nexus
    as clear antagonist, public cure release, career sacrifice explicitly stated.
    Tone maintains medical thriller tension with ethical weight throughout—technical
    language (protein structure, Level 4 outbreak, gene-editing patents) balanced
    against moral stakes. MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Structural accuracy slightly reduced (0.95
    vs 1.0) because the transition between Rising Action and Climax could be more
    distinctly marked—the Nexus revelation emerges somewhat organically from investigation
    rather than as a discrete turning point, though this is a minor issue. Tone score
    at 0.95 (not 1.0) because while tension is excellent, the denouement''s philosophical
    reflection (''peace,'' ''truth over comfort'') slightly softens the thriller edge,
    though this serves thematic purpose. Overall: Exemplary conversion that honors
    both source and target structures.'
