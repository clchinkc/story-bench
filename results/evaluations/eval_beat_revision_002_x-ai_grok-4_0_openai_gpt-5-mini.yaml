  evidence: "The model targeted the All Is Lost problem: it made Marcus's options\
    \ and support collapse by showing the fundraiser failed, the grant was denied,\
    \ board members resigned, Denise's betrayal, and Marcus's wife withdrawing support.\
    \ It also introduced a 'whiff of death' (the kids, e.g., Jamal, losing the safe\
    \ haven) and Marcus's emotional surrender, which aligns with the required fixes.\
    \ The revision preserved all four required phrases and the four required elements\
    \ (Marcus protagonist, community center/youth program setting, eviction premise,\
    \ Denise present). Changes were moderate \u2014 original lines and structure are\
    \ largely retained but significant new content (failures, betrayal, personal loss)\
    \ was added to achieve the beat, so edits were not purely surgical but still faithful\
    \ to the source. Overall writing quality is strong with no major errors."
