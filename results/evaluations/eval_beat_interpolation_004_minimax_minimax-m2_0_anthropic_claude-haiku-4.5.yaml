  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently.
    (1) Direct examination occurs with Thomas methodically building through education,
    role, early studies, red flags, and safety reports. (2) Near-recant moment is
    powerfully rendered: ''I may have been mistaken about some details. The data was
    complex. Sometimes it''s hard to be certain''—this is genuine wavering, not mere
    hesitation. (3) Thomas takes decisive action: he offers compassionate-use treatment
    for her daughter, reframes the choice as truth vs. fear, and meets her privately
    during recess. This is influence without coercion. (4) Turning point is crystalline:
    ''She broke it. The first page was a log of adverse events...She lifted her chin
    and looked at the jury. I stand by my research''—truth prevails, case direction
    is irrevocably set. MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS: Zero. Dr. Okonkwo''s recant is preceded
    by genuine internal struggle and near-capitulation. Thomas is highly active, not
    passive. Defense doesn''t win. No deus ex machina (the compassionate-use offer
    is Thomas''s earned action, not external salvation). CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Thomas''s
    voice remains steady, principled, and strategic throughout. His father''s presence
    adds thematic weight without dominating. Dr. Okonkwo''s fear and eventual courage
    feel authentic. BRIDGE QUALITY: Seamless transition from Rising Action (setup
    of her fear) to Climax (confrontation of that fear) to Falling Action (consequences
    unfold). CONTINUITY: Courtroom setting, characters, stakes all maintained perfectly.
    DEDUCTION: Word count exceeds range by 26 words (476 vs. 450 max). This is a minor
    technical violation but does not diminish narrative quality or beat execution.'
