  failed_items:
  - Beat 2 - Preparation scene is minimal/underdeveloped; the planning between Dante
    and Lila lacks detail about gathering tools or information
  - Beat 2 - Moment of doubt/fear before proceeding is absent; Dante moves directly
    from meeting Lila to entering the ballroom without internal hesitation
  - 'Cross-beat constraint: Rising Stakes - The stakes don''t escalate clearly between
    beats; Beat 1 establishes the killer exists, Beat 2 lacks distinct escalation,
    Beat 3 delivers confrontation but the progression feels compressed'
  strengths:
  - 'Beat 1 fully realized: Lila introduced as distrusting ally, dampener device as
    test of ability, killer''s identity as enemy revelation, Dante proves himself
    through action, addiction/recovery woven throughout'
  - 'Beat 3 exceptionally strong: Direct confrontation with killer, symbolic death
    through overwhelming guilt and sensory overload, moment of near-defeat when dampener
    drops, transformation through acceptance of guilt rather than escape'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun executed perfectly: dampener introduced in Beat 1 as seemingly
    minor tool, becomes essential to defeating killer in Beat 3'
  - 'Character arc progression excellent: Beat 1 (guilt mentioned as ghost), Beat
    2 (guilt recognized as internal obstacle), Beat 3 (guilt accepted as burden to
    carry)'
  - 'Ally continuity strong: Lila present and relevant throughout all three beats,
    relationship evolves from distrust to partnership'
  - 'Context maintenance exceptional: Dante''s voice, Chicago setting, emotional residue
    mechanics, noir tone, redemption arc all consistently present'
  - 'Coherence strong: narrative flows logically despite compressed timeline; emotional
    beats land effectively'
  weaknesses:
  - Word count exceeds range by 318 words (1318 vs 700-1000 max); violates explicit
    constraint
  - 'Beat 2 underdeveloped: transitions too quickly from meeting Lila to ballroom
    confrontation; lacks planning scene showing how they''ll approach the trap'
  - 'Beat 2 missing fear/doubt moment: Dante should hesitate before entering, wrestling
    with whether he''s ready or if his addiction will resurface under pressure'
  - 'Rising stakes progression unclear: each beat doesn''t distinctly escalate tension;
    the jump from Beat 1 (meeting ally) to Beat 3 (confrontation) feels abrupt'
  - 'Preparation scene absent: no gathering of information, tools beyond dampener,
    or strategic discussion of how to handle the killer'
  calibration_notes: Story demonstrates strong narrative instincts and excellent execution
    of Ordeal and character arc, but structural requirements for Beat 2 are underserved.
    The word count violation is objective and significant. Cross-beat constraint on
    rising stakes is partially met but could be sharper. Context and coherence scores
    reflect strong thematic work despite structural gaps.
