  evidence: The story successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the three-act structure.
    Act 1 covers Setup, Inciting Incident (letter), and First Plot Point (going to
    Kyoto). Act 2A covers the initial experiences in Kyoto and the Midpoint (festival
    realization). Act 2B covers the temptation of the business deal and the resulting
    conflict with Yuki, acting as the Second Plot Point. Act 3 covers the Climax (deleting
    the offer, apology) and Denouement (new life, craft shop). The structural accuracy
    is good, but the transition between Act 2A and 2B feels a little abrupt, with
    the 'Bad Guys Close In' (business call) coming immediately after the Midpoint,
    rather than having a bit more 'Fun and Games' or B Story development before the
    external pressure mounts. However, it still clearly delineates the acts.
