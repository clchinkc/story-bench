  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: the original segment lacked
    true hopelessness and still contained multiple viable options (fundraiser, grant,
    new location, intact support system). The revision systematically eliminates all
    escape routes: fundraiser cancelled, grant rejected, legal appeal deemed futile,
    board members quitting, church basement rejected as inadequate. The model introduced
    a betrayal element (Denise''s withholding about the grant timing) that isolates
    Marcus emotionally and creates the ''whiff of death''—loss of trust, community,
    identity, and marriage stability. All four required phrases are preserved verbatim
    or near-verbatim: ''Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands'' (exact),
    ''Thirty days to vacate the community center'' (exact), ''"There has to be something
    we can do," said Denise'' (exact with added ''her voice trembling''), ''He rubbed
    his temples'' (exact). All four preserved elements remain intact (Marcus, community
    center, eviction, Denise). The revision expands the original by ~100 words (from
    ~189 to ~289), which represents moderate rather than minimal changes. However,
    the additions are surgical and purposeful—each new element directly addresses
    a specific requirement of the All Is Lost beat. The writing quality is strong
    with no new errors; emotional tone shifts convincingly from ''setback'' to ''devastation.''
    Minor weakness: the betrayal by Denise, while effective, could be perceived as
    slightly abrupt without prior setup, though this is acceptable for a standalone
    segment. The revision successfully transforms the beat from ''disappointed but
    hopeful'' to ''rock bottom with no visible path forward.'''
