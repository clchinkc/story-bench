  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-sequenced.
    Exposition establishes Samira''s 15-year reputation and the impossible virus discovery.
    Rising Action escalates through the 72-hour investigation, the realization of
    intentional design, and mounting pressure. Climax peaks at the Nexus confrontation
    with maximum tension (quarantine failure imminent, legal threats, truth vs. suppression).
    Falling Action shows the press conference gambit and immediate consequences. Denouement
    provides new equilibrium with Samira unemployable but at peace. All 6 core elements
    preserved: protagonist (Samira), engineered virus, Raj (supporting), Nexus (antagonist),
    public cure release, career sacrifice. Tone is consistently tense, ethically weighted,
    and maintains medical thriller atmosphere throughout. CRITICAL DEDUCTION: Word
    count is 413, significantly below the 500-700 target range (59% of minimum). This
    is a substantial structural requirement failure. The conversion is compressed,
    losing narrative breathing room and detail that would strengthen character development
    and tension escalation. Structural accuracy is high (0.9 not 1.0) because while
    all beats exist, they feel rushed and lack the development Freytag''s pyramid
    typically requires for full dramatic impact. The conversion successfully transforms
    3-act to 5-act structure but sacrifices depth for brevity.'
