  evidence: The model correctly identified the 'telling not showing' flaw and completely
    rewrote the segment to address it. It successfully shows Rachel's detective skills,
    her relationship with James, her devotion to work, and the setting through action
    and dialogue. All required preserved phrases are present. While the changes were
    extensive, they were necessary to fix the fundamental flaw of the original segment.
