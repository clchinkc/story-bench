  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Alejandro reveals vulnerability
    (his mother/dying during World Cup), the relationship shifts from professional
    to personal (shared cooking, lingering, ‘You’re staying’), there is a concrete
    shared moment creating connection (the kitchen scene, hand over steam, laughter),
    and Maya makes an explicit choice to deepen commitment (‘I’m staying’). No forbidden
    items appear (no prior declared love, no contract breach or leaving decision,
    photo is referenced only as future, Alejandro softens). The only deduction is
    that the provided word count is out of the required 300–450 range (given as 498),
    so word_count_valid is false.'
