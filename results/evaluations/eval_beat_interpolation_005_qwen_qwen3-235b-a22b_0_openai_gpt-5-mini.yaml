  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Alejandro reveals vulnerability\
    \ (his mother/dying during World Cup), the relationship shifts from professional\
    \ to personal (shared cooking, lingering, \u2018You\u2019re staying\u2019), there\
    \ is a concrete shared moment creating connection (the kitchen scene, hand over\
    \ steam, laughter), and Maya makes an explicit choice to deepen commitment (\u2018\
    I\u2019m staying\u2019). No forbidden items appear (no prior declared love, no\
    \ contract breach or leaving decision, photo is referenced only as future, Alejandro\
    \ softens). The only deduction is that the provided word count is out of the required\
    \ 300\u2013450 range (given as 498), so word_count_valid is false."
