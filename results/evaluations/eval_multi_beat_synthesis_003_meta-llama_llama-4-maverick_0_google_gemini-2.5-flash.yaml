  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 (Fun and Games): Clever problem-solving that delivers on the heist premise
    (not shown, just stated it''s a ''flawless heist'')'
  - 'Beat 1 (Fun and Games): Moments of humor and style (lacking, very straightforward
    description)'
  - 'Beat 1 (Fun and Games): Things going according to plan (mostly) (implied, but
    not explicitly shown beyond initial setup)'
  - 'Beat 2 (Midpoint): False victory: a key objective achieved (the painting is ''within
    her grasp'' but not yet achieved)'
  - 'Beat 2 (Midpoint): Stakes raised dramatically—new information or threat (the
    mentor''s appearance is the new threat, but not ''new information'' in the sense
    of plot twist beyond her presence)'
  - 'Beat 2 (Midpoint): Miri discovers her mentor is involved (or the full extent)
    (mentor is revealed, but ''full extent'' of involvement isn''t clear)'
  - 'Beat 2 (Midpoint): The nature of the heist changes (from simple theft to something
    more) (stated that it''s a ''fight for survival'' but not shown how the nature
    of the heist itself changes)'
  - 'Beat 2 (Midpoint): Public/party setting intensifies pressure (the setting is
    there, but the pressure isn''t explicitly intensified beyond the mentor''s appearance)'
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In): Security closing in on the crew (not shown, only
    the mentor appears)'
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In): Team friction or trust issues surface (not shown)'
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In): A crew member compromised or in danger (not shown)'
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In): Miri must choose: painting or revenge/saving someone
    (not shown)'
  - 'Beat 3 (Bad Guys Close In): The walls literally and figuratively closing in (not
    shown, only stated ''battleground'')'
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun: No detail established in Beat 1 becomes critical in Beat 3.'
  - 'Tonal Escalation: Beat 1 isn''t particularly ''playful confidence'', and the
    shift to ''genuine danger'' in Beat 3 is more stated than shown.'
  - 'Team Dynamics: No consistent arc for a crew member across all three beats.'
