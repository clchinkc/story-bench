  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation
    and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.
    The revision fixes this by: (1) Adding the breathing technique from meditation
    as a concrete tool she applies (''counting, feeling the air move''), (2) Showing
    internal conflict—she reaches for the phone habitually but pauses, demonstrating
    changed behavior, (3) Making a different choice than her ''pre-Trip self'' would
    have (''It can wait an hour'' vs. automatic ''no''), (4) Providing explicit contrast
    (''Her mother glanced over, surprised''), (5) Showing changed perspective on her
    environment (''less like a checklist and more like a place''), (6) Demonstrating
    new priorities (''good to be home'' before work). All 4 required phrases preserved
    exactly: ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare'', ''How was Thailand? her mother
    asked'', ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'', ''It''s good to be home, she
    said''. Changes were surgical: inserted meditation-specific details, modified
    her phone interaction sequence, added mother''s reaction, expanded final reflection.
    No new errors introduced. The revision maintains original structure while embedding
    transformation evidence throughout, fully satisfying the Return (Having Changed)
    beat requirement.'
