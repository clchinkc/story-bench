  evidence: 'ELEMENTS FOUND: (1) Sarah considers recanting testimony as ''easy way
    out'' - explicit. (2) Sarah considers going to authorities (Captain Morrison,
    pushing for protection) - explicit via Marcus''s suggestion. (3) Internal conflict
    about duty vs. sister''s life - strong throughout (''what good was justice if
    it cost her sister''s life''). (4) MISSING: No clear moment/conversation that
    tips her toward the third option (going rogue). The decision appears to crystallize
    internally without a definitive catalyst within the debate itself. MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS:
    (1) Sarah ''had to take matters into her own hands'' and ''resolve hardened''
    suggests she''s already decided to go rogue during the debate, which skips the
    actual wrestling with the decision. (2) The AFTER section reveals she''s already
    resigned and become a ''vigilante,'' indicating the decision was made before or
    during this beat rather than being the culmination. This violates the spirit of
    the Debate beat where the commitment should come at the END, not during. STRENGTHS:
    Excellent internal monologue, strong character voice, good pacing, natural dialogue
    with Marcus. The conflict is genuine and emotionally resonant. WEAKNESSES: The
    beat conflates internal realization with external commitment; by the end of the
    generated text, Sarah has already decided to act alone, which belongs in Break
    Into Two, not Debate. The transition feels rushed rather than earned through genuine
    debate.'
