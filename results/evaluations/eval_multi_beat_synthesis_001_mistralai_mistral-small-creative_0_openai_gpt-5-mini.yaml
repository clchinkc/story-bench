  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1: Revelation of an enemy within the Resonant community (a traitor) — the
    story presents a killer but not a revealed traitor inside the Resonant community.'
  - 'Beat 2: Dante and his new ally plan how to confront the killer — there is only
    minimal instruction/orders from Lila rather than a developed joint planning sequence.'
  - 'Beat 2: Dante realizes the confrontation will require facing his guilt about
    his sister — the explicit recognition that the confrontation will demand facing
    his sister-related guilt occurs during the Ordeal, not during the Approach/Preparation
    beat, so the required mid-story recognition is missing.'
  - 'Cross-beat constraint: Character Arc Progression — while guilt is mentioned (Beat
    1) and transformed (Beat 3), the intermediate step (explicit recognition of guilt
    as an obstacle in Beat 2) is not clearly present, breaking the required three-beat
    arc.'
