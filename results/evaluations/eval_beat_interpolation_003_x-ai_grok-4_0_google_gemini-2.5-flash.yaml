  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Yuki explores crew quarters and medical
    bay, discovers clues about dimensional barriers and cellular decoherence, encounters
    the shimmering crew members, and overcomes the obstacle of the shimmers and the
    locked lab door. All ''must not'' items are avoided. The character remains consistent,
    and the bridge to the next beat is seamless, with Yuki heading to Lab Seven to
    find the data core.'
