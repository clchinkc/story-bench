  evidence: 'Only Act 1 (Setup/Inciting material) is present: Kenji''s fallen corporate
    world, the estranged-daughter letter (wedding in Kyoto) and his debate/temptation
    are shown. Acts 2A/2B and Act 3 (rising complications, midpoint turn, second plot
    point, climax/resolution) are missing; the scene ends mid-sentence. Preserved
    elements: Kenji, lost career, Yuki, Kyoto wedding, business-deal temptation, and
    the theme of choosing people over ambition are all present (6/8). Missing: Haruki
    the bamboo craftsman and the ending at the bamboo craft shop. Tone is well-maintained
    (quiet drama, Japanese aesthetic) but structure is incomplete. Word count requirement
    (550–750) is not met.'
