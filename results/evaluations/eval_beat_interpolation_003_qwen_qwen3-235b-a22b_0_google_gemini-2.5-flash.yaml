  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. Yuki explores multiple
    areas (lower decks, med bay, crew quarters, engineering), discovers clues (patient
    log, melted holophoto, datapad, quantum entanglement logs), encounters transformed
    crew (flickering shapes, quasar eyes, whispers), and overcomes a challenge (rerouting
    power, opening Lab Seven airlock). All 'must not' conditions are avoided. The
    narrative clearly functions as a 'Search' beat, showing Yuki's struggle and adaptation
    without immediate discovery or full understanding. Character and continuity are
    consistent, and the bridge to the next beat is seamless.
