  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated.\
    \ (1) You: Library comfort zone established with sensory detail and psychological\
    \ safety. (2) Need: Ache of invisibility and adjacent life explicitly named. (3)\
    \ Go: Ms. Okafor's program entry with recorder handoff. (4) Search: Five interviews\
    \ showing iterative learning and adaptation. (5) Find: Bernard's breakthrough\
    \ moment ('I never told anyone...') and Zoe's realization about silence as space.\
    \ (6) Take: Town hall presentation with explicit cost (vulnerability, public exposure).\
    \ (7) Return: Post-summer return to shelving but transformed perspective. (8)\
    \ Change: Demonstrated through journalism applications, continued visiting Bernard,\
    \ and internalized courage. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist),\
    \ library setting, oral history program, Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard\
    \ Park (key relationship), social anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation\
    \ (climactic scene), Bernard's death (emotional anchor), journalism ending (future\
    \ orientation). Tone is consistently gentle, intimate, and emotionally true\u2014\
    intimate third-person POV, sensory language ('paper and dust,' 'warm from Ms.\
    \ Okafor's hand'), internal emotional honesty. DEDUCTIONS: Word count (1298) significantly\
    \ exceeds target range (500-700), representing 85% overage. This is a substantial\
    \ structural violation that affects pacing and brevity requirements, though content\
    \ quality remains high. Structural accuracy slightly reduced because the expanded\
    \ length, while narratively rich, dilutes the Story Circle's typical economy.\
    \ The conversion is thorough but not concise."
