  evidence: 'Model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation
    and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.
    The revision fixes this precisely by: (1) Adding deliberate phone-setting-down
    action showing awareness of old habit, (2) Demonstrating changed behavior—Sophie
    chooses to wait on work calls rather than immediately respond, (3) Integrating
    specific retreat insight (''hours spent in silent contemplation'') that directly
    informs her decision, (4) Creating clear contrast between old self (would have
    called Linda immediately) and new self (will call after self-care), (5) Mother''s
    implicit noticing through Sophie''s changed demeanor. All 4 required phrases preserved
    exactly: ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare'', ''How was Thailand? her mother
    asked'', ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'', ''It''s good to be home, she
    said''. Changes were surgical: added 3 key sentences showing internal conflict
    and decision-making, modified one line to show restraint, added closing reflection.
    Minimal structural disruption. Only weakness: word count (195 vs 200-350 requirement)
    falls short by 5 words, preventing perfect score. Writing quality remains high
    with no new errors introduced.'
