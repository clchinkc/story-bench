  failed_items:
  - Beat 1 - 'Things going according to plan (mostly)' is undermined; the false alarm
    shadow and Alex's missed firewall are revealed too early, collapsing the 'mostly
    smooth' phase into immediate complications rather than sustaining playful confidence
    through the heist execution
  - Beat 1 - Minor complication (tipsy guest) is resolved too quickly and trivially;
    it doesn't meaningfully test crew skills or create tension that carries forward
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional Chekhov''s Gun execution: Alex''s overconfident hacking setup in
    Beat 1 (''child''s play,'' ''wizard'') directly causes the secondary firewall
    miss in Beat 2, which triggers the full crisis in Beat 3. The bilge exit he cleared
    becomes a trap. Seamless cause-and-effect.'
  - 'Tonal escalation is precise: Beat 1 opens with dry wit and ''piece of cake''
    confidence; Beat 2 shifts to ''Victory tasted false now, laced with betrayal'';
    Beat 3 delivers gallows humor (''I always thought my comeback tour would end with
    champagne, not handcuffs''). Tone tracks perfectly.'
  - "Mentor presence arc is masterfully calibrated: Beat 1 (Elena is a shadow, unnoticed);\
    \ Beat 2 (Elena recognized, locks eyes, reveals herself as security consultant\u2014\
    the full betrayal); Beat 3 (Elena is the active hunter, broadcasting commands,\
    \ closing in). Escalation is organic."
  - "Team dynamics with Alex are compelling: Beat 1 (cocky, boastful, overconfident);\
    \ Beat 2 (his hubris exposed, panic sets in, he's pinned); Beat 3 (Miri must choose\
    \ between revenge and saving him\u2014his arc drives her moral choice). Consistent\
    \ and consequential."
  - 'Context maintained excellently: Monaco setting, Grand Prix backdrop, yacht party
    glamour, Ocean''s Eleven tone with art history stakes all present. Miri''s characterization
    (dry wit, meticulous, wrongfully accused) is consistent.'
  - "Coherence is strong: Each beat flows logically into the next. The heist setup\
    \ \u2192 Elena's reveal \u2192 crew in danger creates a unified narrative arc\
    \ with clear escalation."
  weaknesses:
  - Word count exceeds range (1136 vs. 700-1000 max). This is a technical failure,
    though the content quality doesn't suffer.
  - Beat 1's 'mostly smooth' phase is compressed. The false alarm shadow and Alex's
    firewall miss are introduced mid-heist rather than after a sustained period of
    things working well. This slightly undercuts the 'playful confidence' tone anchor
    for Beat 1.
  - The minor complication (tipsy guest) feels perfunctory. It's resolved in two lines
    and doesn't create meaningful tension or showcase crew problem-solving in a memorable
    way. A stronger complication would deepen Beat 1's 'Fun and Games' feel.
  - Lena's arc is less developed than Alex's. While she has moments (distraction,
    diversion), her character doesn't have the same through-line of consequence that
    Alex does. She's more functional than dynamic.
  calibration_notes: 'This is a strong execution with only minor gaps. The beat requirements
    are nearly all satisfied (13/15), and the cross-beat constraints are flawlessly
    met. The Chekhov''s Gun setup is textbook perfect, tonal escalation is precise,
    mentor presence is expertly calibrated, and team dynamics drive plot. The main
    deductions are: (1) word count violation (technical), (2) Beat 1''s ''mostly smooth''
    phase is slightly rushed, and (3) the minor complication lacks impact. These are
    refinement issues, not fundamental failures. The story demonstrates strong narrative
    architecture and character work. Score reflects ''Good'' tier with minor issues.'
