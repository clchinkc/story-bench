  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—that the original
    was pure exposition-as-summary (telling) rather than exposition-as-scene (showing).
    The revision transforms the segment into a lived moment with sensory grounding,
    action, and dialogue that naturally reveals character traits. FLAW CORRECTION:
    Excellent execution. The revision shows: (1) Rachel''s detective instincts through
    her fixation on the Martinez cold case and her reading of environmental details;
    (2) Her relationship with James through natural dialogue (''You''re gonna wear
    a hole in that pen''), physical proximity, and mutual understanding; (3) Her devotion
    to work through her inability to stop thinking about unsolved cases; (4) Setting
    through rich sensory detail (fluorescent hum, bergamot aftershave, damp October
    air, grimy windows). The cat appears organically in the scene. All 5 preserved
    elements present: Rachel Torres (protagonist), James Oyelaran (partner), Sherlock
    (cat), Queens setting (implied via James''s Harlem apartment reference and precinct
    location), October timing (explicit). All 4 required phrases present or near-exact:
    ''Detective Rachel Torres,'' ''Detective James Oyelaran,'' ''cat named Sherlock,''
    ''October'' (though ''Tuesday morning'' is not explicitly stated—minor gap). MINIMAL
    CHANGE ISSUE: This is a COMPLETE REWRITE, not minimal surgical edits. The original
    410-word segment was entirely replaced with a new 410-word scene. While the rewrite
    is superior in quality and correctly addresses the flaw, it violates the ''minimal
    modification'' constraint. The model was instructed to make MINIMAL changes while
    fixing the flaw, but instead produced a wholesale reconstruction. QUALITY: Writing
    is professional, vivid, and error-free. Sensory details are precise (''copper
    tang,'' ''bergamot,'' ''linoleum''). Dialogue feels natural. Pacing is strong.
    The only weakness is the constraint violation and the missing ''Tuesday morning''
    phrase (minor). BEAT SATISFACTION: Exposition beat is well-executed—establishes
    baseline, shows ordinary world before inciting incident, creates investment through
    character behavior and relationship dynamics.'
