  evidence: "Only the Resolution/Act 3 is clearly present (Kenji's quiet redemption\
    \ and embrace of bamboo craft). Act 1 Setup lacks a clear Ordinary World/Inciting\
    \ Incident/First Plot Point in the converted text (the catalyst letter and his\
    \ corporate fall are only implied, not shown as structural beats). Acts 2A/2B\
    \ (midpoint complications, escalating obstacles, and a decisive Second Plot Point)\
    \ are weak or missing \u2014 no clear midpoint turning event or business-deal\
    \ temptation appears. Preserved elements: Kenji, lost corporate career (referenced),\
    \ Yuki, wedding in Kyoto, Haruki, and the theme of choosing people over ambition\
    \ are present. Missing/weak: explicit business-deal temptation and a clear ending\
    \ at a bamboo craft shop (the text shows him helping Haruki but not an explicit\
    \ bamboo shop resolution). Tone (quiet Japanese drama, redemptive) is well maintained."
