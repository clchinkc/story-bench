  evidence: 'The model appears to have addressed the actual flaw by making the fight
    an internal Ordeal: the dragon explicitly exploits Kira''s guilt over her brother,
    forcing a confrontation with her deepest fear; a symbolic ''death'' occurs when
    she pierces the dragon and ''the guilt that had chained her''; a rebirth/transformation
    is stated (weight shifting from guilt to understanding); and victory stems from
    this new understanding rather than mere persistence. Shortcomings: the ''death''
    moment is more implied than sharply dramatized (no clear instant where Kira believes
    she will surely die), and a few phrasing errors remain (''a earth-shaking roar'',
    ''flight or flight'') so the execution isn''t fully airtight. Changes were moderate
    — the original lines and outcome were preserved verbatim in key places, with added
    interiority and a few new lines to create the psychological arc.'
