  evidence: "All 8 Story Circle beats are clearly present and well-sequenced: (1)\
    \ You\u2014opening library refuge paragraph establishes comfort zone; (2) Need\u2014\
    'subtle yearning' and desire for connection articulated; (3) Go\u2014'Leaving\
    \ her safe world behind, she stepped into unfamiliar territory'; (4) Search\u2014\
    'deep in the art of listening' and navigating interviews with Bernard; (5) Find\u2014\
    'breakthrough came during one raw, rain-soaked afternoon' with Bernard's confession;\
    \ (6) Take\u2014town hall presentation where she 'lent her voice' publicly; (7)\
    \ Return\u2014'returned to her familiar halls of the library, changed'; (8) Change\u2014\
    demonstrated through journalism applications and transformed relationship to her\
    \ world. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral\
    \ history program, Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key relationship),\
    \ social anxiety (woven throughout), town hall presentation (explicit scene),\
    \ Bernard's death and funeral (October reference), journalism school ending. Tone\
    \ is consistently gentle, intimate, and emotionally true throughout\u2014vulnerable\
    \ language ('heart thumping,' 'trembled,' 'whispered words'), introspective reflection,\
    \ and authentic emotional beats. Minor deduction (0.05) for structural_accuracy:\
    \ the 'Search' phase could be slightly more distinct as a separate adaptive challenge\
    \ phase before the 'Find' breakthrough, though the current structure handles this\
    \ adequately. Minor tone deduction (0.05): occasional phrases ('mosaic of voices\
    \ interwoven') approach slightly lyrical/purple prose territory, though generally\
    \ maintains appropriate restraint."
