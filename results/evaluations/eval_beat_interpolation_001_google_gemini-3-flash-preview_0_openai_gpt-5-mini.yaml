  evidence: All four required elements are present (Marcus introduced; practical wisdom
    and tools provided; Elena’s doubt shifts toward reluctant acceptance; librarian
    skills referenced). No forbidden items appear (Elena does not become immediately
    confident, mentor does not solve her problems or offer to accompany her, she is
    not in the forest, and she does not discover magical powers). Character voices
    and setting remain consistent, and the scene effectively bridges refusal to the
    threshold.
