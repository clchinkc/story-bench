  evidence: 'The model addressed the correct flaw: it made the Ordeal an internal
    confrontation by having the dragon invoke Kira''s guilt over her brother, produced
    a symbolic ''death'' (the death of the guilt-ridden self), and a rebirth (forgiveness
    and new purpose) that directly enables victory. Required elements and setting
    lines were preserved. Changes were more than purely surgical (substantial internal
    monologue and scene expansion) but remained faithful to the original beats and
    outcome.'
