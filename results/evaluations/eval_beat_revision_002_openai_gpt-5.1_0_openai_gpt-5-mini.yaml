  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual All Is Lost flaw by introducing: the fundraiser''s
    failure, the grant rejection, a board betrayal (Denise joining Keller), and a
    personal/emotional isolation (wife''s plea, Marcus turning the phone face down).
    This creates a clear ''whiff of death'' and leaves Marcus with no realistic options,
    conveying genuine hopelessness. The required phrases and scene elements were preserved
    exactly. Changes were moderate—several new lines and beats were added to deepen
    the defeat rather than a full rewrite—so the edit is not minimal but constrained
    and effective. Writing quality is strong with no major errors.'
