  evidence: "All twelve Campbell beats are represented: Ordinary World (pottery workshop),\
    \ Call to Adventure (dried spring/ritual need), Refusal (hesitation at forest\
    \ edge, doubts), Meeting the Mentor (grandmother's journal/legacy), Crossing the\
    \ Threshold (entering shrine), Tests/Allies/Enemies (fasting, kneading, internal\
    \ doubts as antagonistic force), Approach to Inmost Cave (surrendering into stillness),\
    \ Ordeal (the difficult creation process), Reward (the completed jar), The Road\
    \ Back (descent with the jar, almost abandoning it), Resurrection (restoration\
    \ at the spring and inner realization), Return with the Elixir (spring restored;\
    \ transformed approach to craft). All seven required elements are preserved: Maya,\
    \ pottery, grandmother's legacy, mountain shrine journey, dried spring problem,\
    \ theme of surrender, and Maya's transformation. Deduction from a perfect structural\
    \ score because 'Allies' are not clearly distinct as characters (they're mostly\
    \ internalized or merged with Tests/Enemies), and the Refusal beat is brief; otherwise\
    \ structure closely follows the monomyth. Word count is invalid per the given\
    \ requirement (text provided = 498 words, outside 600\u2013800). Tone is quiet,\
    \ meditative, and transformative, matching the brief."
