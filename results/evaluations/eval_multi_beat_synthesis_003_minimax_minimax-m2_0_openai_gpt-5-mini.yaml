  failed_items:
  - "Beat 3 \u2014 Team friction or trust issues surface: No clear conflict or tension\
    \ within the crew is shown."
  - "Beat 3 \u2014 A crew member compromised or in danger: No one is shown captured,\
    \ exposed, or endangered."
  - "Beat 3 \u2014 Miri must choose: painting or revenge/saving someone: No pivotal\
    \ choice is presented."
  - "Beat 3 \u2014 The walls literally and figuratively closing in: The sense of genuine\
    \ entrapment/escalation is minimal."
  - "Cross-beat \u2014 Chekhov's Gun payoff missing: Details introduced in Fun & Games\
    \ (e.g., the autopilot shift/text) are not used as a critical payoff during the\
    \ closing-in section."
  - "Cross-beat \u2014 Tonal escalation incomplete: Tone moves from playful to raised\
    \ stakes but never reaches clear genuine danger/gallows-humor in Beat 3."
  - "Cross-beat \u2014 Mentor presence not fully active in Beat 3: Eleanor is revealed\
    \ and issues orders, but does not become an active, escalating threat by Beat\
    \ 3 as required."
  - "Cross-beat \u2014 Team dynamics arc across beats not established: No single crew\
    \ member demonstrates a sustained arc across all three beats that meaningfully\
    \ affects the outcome."
  - "Coherence \u2014 Repetition and duplicated paragraphs severely undermine narrative\
    \ flow and clarity."
  - "Structural \u2014 Story ends (or stops) before Bad Guys Close In is fully developed\
    \ or resolved, leaving several beat requirements under-addressed."
  - "Word count \u2014 Exceeds required range (provided word_count=3146), so word_count_valid\
    \ is false."
