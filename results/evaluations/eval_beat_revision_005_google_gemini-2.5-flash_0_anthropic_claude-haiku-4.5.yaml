  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive
    reasoning. The model accurately recognized all five key requirements were satisfied:
    (1) follows major defeat (gallery closure), (2) protagonist isolated (dark apartment,
    unanswered calls), (3) genuine despair and reflection (sitting on floor, tears,
    failed promises), (4) no solutions presented (pure wallowing state), and (5) whiff
    of death element (mother''s passing, hospice memory, painting symbolism). The
    model demonstrated strong beat understanding by explaining why each element works
    and avoided the false positive trap of over-diagnosing problems in a well-executed
    segment. The explanation was detailed, accurate, and grounded in the specific
    text evidence.'
