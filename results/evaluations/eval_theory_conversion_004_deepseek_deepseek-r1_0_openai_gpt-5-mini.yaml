  evidence: All eight Dan Harmon beats are clearly present and mapped (You/Need/Go/Search/Find/Take/Return/Change).
    All eight required elements are preserved (Zoe, library/oral-history program,
    Ms. Okafor, Bernard Park, Zoe’s social anxiety, town-hall presentation, Bernard’s
    death, and Zoe choosing journalism). No substantive deductions — structure and
    gentle, intimate tone are faithfully maintained.
