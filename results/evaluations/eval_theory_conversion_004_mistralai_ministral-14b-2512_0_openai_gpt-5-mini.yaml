  evidence: "All eight Dan Harmon beats are present and clearly signposted: comfort\
    \ zone (library), need (craving connection), go (joining the oral-history program\
    \ and first interview), search (practicing interviews, learning to listen), find\
    \ (breakthrough with Bernard's confession), take (town-hall presentation where\
    \ she owns the story), return (resuming life, speaking at funeral), change (applying\
    \ to journalism, public-speaking growth). All eight required elements are preserved\
    \ (Zoe, library/program, Ms. Okafor, Bernard, social anxiety, town hall, Bernard's\
    \ death, journalism ending). Slight deduction on structural_accuracy_score (0.95)\
    \ because the 'Take/pay price' beat is present but the cost felt minimal\u2014\
    mostly internal fear and responsibility rather than a clearly consequential sacrifice\u2014\
    so the dramatic pay-off could be a bit stronger to match Harmon's typical emphasis\
    \ on a tangible price paid. Tone is gently intimate and emotionally true throughout,\
    \ so full score there."
