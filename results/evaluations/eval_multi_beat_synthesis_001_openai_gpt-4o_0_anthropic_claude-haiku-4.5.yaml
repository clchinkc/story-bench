  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1: Reference to addiction/recovery as relevant to character - mentioned
    only obliquely (''past failings''), not explicitly connected to his current abilities
    or approach'
  - 'Cross-beat Chekhov''s Gun: Rosa''s teachings appear in Beat 3 but weren''t introduced
    as a specific tool/detail in Beat 1 - the photograph of sister is introduced but
    not utilized in resolution'
  - 'Word count: 697 words falls short of 700-1000 range requirement by 3 words'
  strengths:
  - Beat 1 excellently establishes Miguel as distrustful ally; emotional display test
    is vivid and pressure-laden
  - Traitor revelation and proof-of-ability requirements fully satisfied
  - Beat 2 effectively shows planning, doubt ('Could he really do this?'), and symbolic
    threshold crossing into basement
  - Beat 3 delivers strong ordeal with overwhelming guilt, symbolic death through
    despair, and transformation through acceptance of pain
  - "Character arc progression is clear: guilt mentioned (Beat 1) \u2192 recognized\
    \ as obstacle (Beat 2) \u2192 transformed through acceptance (Beat 3)"
  - "Rising stakes maintained throughout: initial distrust \u2192 planning confrontation\
    \ \u2192 life-or-death ordeal"
  - 'Ally continuity strong: Miguel present and relevant across all three beats'
  - Noir tone, melancholic determination, and redemption arc well-maintained throughout
  - Setting (Buckingham Hotel, emotional residue) consistently evoked with atmospheric
    detail
  weaknesses:
  - Addiction/recovery aspect underutilized - could be more explicitly tied to how
    Dante approaches the confrontation or his emotional resilience
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun constraint partially fails: Rosa''s wisdom appears as deus ex
    machina rather than being established as a specific tool in Beat 1'
  - Sister's photograph introduced but not actively used in resolution - missed opportunity
    for concrete object-based payoff
  - Killer's identity revealed but not fully explored - 'familiar face' is vague and
    could be more impactful
  - Word count shortfall is minor but technical failure
  calibration_notes: "Story demonstrates strong narrative craft with clear beat structure\
    \ and emotional resonance. The three-beat progression follows Campbell's monomyth\
    \ effectively, particularly in the Ordeal's symbolic death and transformation.\
    \ Context and tone are excellently maintained. Primary deductions stem from: (1)\
    \ incomplete integration of addiction/recovery theme into character motivation,\
    \ (2) Chekhov's Gun constraint not fully satisfied due to Rosa's teachings appearing\
    \ without prior setup, and (3) technical word count miss. The story would score\
    \ 0.8-0.85 overall\u2014good execution with minor structural gaps."
