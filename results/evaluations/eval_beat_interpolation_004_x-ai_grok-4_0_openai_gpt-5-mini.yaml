  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Thomas''s direct examination,
    an apparent recantation, Thomas taking decisive action that influences Dr. Okonkwo,
    and the turning point where truth prevails. The scene functions clearly as the
    Climax. None of the forbidden items (simple unconflicted truth-telling, Thomas
    passivity, defense victory, or deus ex machina) occur. The only issue is technical:
    the excerpt is 471 words, outside the required 300–450 range.'
