  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw that the original
    segment treated The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis.
    It introduced Kira's deepest fear (guilt over her brother's death) through the
    dragon's dialogue, created a 'death' moment where all hope seemed lost and her
    spirit was threatened, and showed a rebirth/transformation where she gained new
    clarity and understanding. Victory came from this new understanding and resilience,
    not just persistence. The changes were significant enough to fix the flaw but
    still maintained much of the original structure and key phrases.
