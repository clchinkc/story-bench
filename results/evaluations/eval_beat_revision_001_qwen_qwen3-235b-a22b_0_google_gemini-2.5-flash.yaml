  evidence: 'The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw that the original
    segment treated The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis.
    It introduced Kira''s deepest fear (guilt over her brother''s death) and had the
    dragon exploit it. It included a clear ''death'' moment where Kira collapses and
    feels crushed by shame, followed by a rebirth/transformation where she remembers
    her brother''s words and rises with new understanding. Her victory comes from
    this new insight and resolve, not just persistence. The changes were significant
    enough to fix the flaw but still maintained much of the original structure and
    narrative flow. One required phrase was slightly altered: ''The Shadow Dragon
    collapsed with an earth-shaking roar'' instead of ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed
    with a earth-shaking roar''.'
