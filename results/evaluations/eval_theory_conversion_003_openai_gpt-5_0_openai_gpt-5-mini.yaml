  evidence: "All four three-act beats are present: Act 1 (setup/ordinary world and\
    \ inciting incident = the letter; first plot point = Kenji travels to Kyoto),\
    \ Act 2A (rising action/first half = learning from Haruki, participating in preparations;\
    \ emotional midpoint = festival/warmth with Yuki), Act 2B (second half complications\
    \ = business suitors and Yuki's confrontation; second plot point = his decision\
    \ to refuse the deal and wait), Act 3 (resolution = reconciliation at the wedding\
    \ and epilogue bamboo shop). All eight required elements appear explicitly (Kenji,\
    \ lost career, Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki, business temptation, theme of choosing\
    \ people over ambition, ending with bamboo craft shop). Word count is invalid\
    \ for the assignment (provided text = 1099 words; required range 550\u2013750).\
    \ Slight deduction for structural_accuracy_score (0.9) because while the three-act\
    \ pivots are all present and logically ordered, a couple of beats (midpoint vs.\
    \ first-half climax and the exact second-plot-point hinge) are lightly blended\
    \ rather than marked with very sharp, discrete transitions; tone_score deducted\
    \ slightly (0.95) for being excellent overall but with minimal spots where exposition\
    \ is denser than the quiet, spare Japanese aesthetic requested."
