  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The 'Search' beat's
    function is clearly fulfilled, with Yuki actively exploring, finding clues, encountering
    the transformed crew, and overcoming an obstacle. None of the 'must not' items
    were violated. Character and setting continuity are maintained, and the bridge
    between the BEFORE and AFTER beats is seamless.
