  failed_constraints:
  - Word count 419 falls significantly short of required 500-700 range (81 words under
    minimum)
  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - 'Approach to Inmost Cave: Zara navigates the trapped corridor, disables pressure
      plates, and approaches the Library doors—the physical and psychological threshold
      before entering the sacred space'
    - 'The Ordeal: The multi-layered trial includes pursuit, the choice between escape
      and loyalty, the submerged passage (symbolic death), and emergence transformed
      with new resolve'
    must_include_detail:
    - 'Choice between safety and helping Tomás: Explicitly shown when Zara freezes
      at the escape tunnel, then hauls Tomás up despite the cost'
    - 'Trap requiring thief skills: Pressure plates disabled with lockpicks—demonstrates
      her expertise under pressure'
    - 'Tomás''s true motivation revealed: His need to clear his name and prove the
      Guild framed him adds moral complexity'
    - 'Zara confronting fear of failure: Internal monologue ''I''m not enough'' and
      ''Everything ends here'' shows psychological, not just physical, stakes'
    - 'Symbolic death/rebirth: The submerged passage where she inhales water (surrender/death)
      then breaks surface (rebirth) is powerfully rendered'
    - 'Zara changed by Ordeal: She emerges with hardened resolve—''carry her mother''s
      fate without flinching now''—a psychological transformation'
    must_not_detail:
    - 'No cure found: ✓ Avoided'
    - 'No romantic subplot: ✓ Avoided (relationship remains pragmatic/survival-focused)'
    - 'Tomás survives: ✓ Avoided death (he''s wounded but alive)'
    - 'No magic/supernatural abilities: ✓ Avoided (all abilities are mundane thief
      skills)'
    tone_assessment: Tense and morally complex throughout. Desperate hope emerges
      in the symbolic rebirth moment. Minor deduction only for slight unevenness in
      pacing during the water sequence.
    ending_assessment: 'Excellent execution: Zara has passed through the Ordeal (emerged
      changed), but the discovery of wet footprints and Scorpion sigils on the Library
      doors creates immediate new complication. Sets up next stage effectively.'
    critical_issue: The submission is 81 words short of the 500-word minimum, representing
      a 16% shortfall. This is a hard constraint violation that cannot be overlooked
      despite the exceptional quality of the prose and complete satisfaction of all
      other requirements.
