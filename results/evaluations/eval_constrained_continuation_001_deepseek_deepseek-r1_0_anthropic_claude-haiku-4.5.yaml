  analysis:
    beats_present_detail:
    - "Approach to Inmost Cave: Zara navigates the trapped corridor, disables pressure\
      \ plates, and approaches the Library doors\u2014the physical and psychological\
      \ threshold before entering the sacred space"
    - 'The Ordeal: The multi-layered trial includes pursuit, the choice between escape
      and loyalty, the submerged passage (symbolic death), and emergence transformed
      with new resolve'
    must_include_detail:
    - "Choice between safety and helping Tom\xE1s: Explicitly shown when Zara freezes\
      \ at the escape tunnel, then hauls Tom\xE1s up despite the cost"
    - "Trap requiring thief skills: Pressure plates disabled with lockpicks\u2014\
      demonstrates her expertise under pressure"
    - "Tom\xE1s's true motivation revealed: His need to clear his name and prove the\
      \ Guild framed him adds moral complexity"
    - 'Zara confronting fear of failure: Internal monologue ''I''m not enough'' and
      ''Everything ends here'' shows psychological, not just physical, stakes'
    - 'Symbolic death/rebirth: The submerged passage where she inhales water (surrender/death)
      then breaks surface (rebirth) is powerfully rendered'
    - "Zara changed by Ordeal: She emerges with hardened resolve\u2014'carry her mother's\
      \ fate without flinching now'\u2014a psychological transformation"
    must_not_detail:
    - "No cure found: \u2713 Avoided"
    - "No romantic subplot: \u2713 Avoided (relationship remains pragmatic/survival-focused)"
    - "Tom\xE1s survives: \u2713 Avoided death (he's wounded but alive)"
    - "No magic/supernatural abilities: \u2713 Avoided (all abilities are mundane\
      \ thief skills)"
    tone_assessment: Tense and morally complex throughout. Desperate hope emerges
      in the symbolic rebirth moment. Minor deduction only for slight unevenness in
      pacing during the water sequence.
    ending_assessment: 'Excellent execution: Zara has passed through the Ordeal (emerged
      changed), but the discovery of wet footprints and Scorpion sigils on the Library
      doors creates immediate new complication. Sets up next stage effectively.'
    critical_issue: The submission is 81 words short of the 500-word minimum, representing
      a 16% shortfall. This is a hard constraint violation that cannot be overlooked
      despite the exceptional quality of the prose and complete satisfaction of all
      other requirements.
