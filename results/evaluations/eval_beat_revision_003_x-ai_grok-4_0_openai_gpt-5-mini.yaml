  evidence: 'The revision directly addresses the Return/Change flaw by showing Sophie
    applying a specific lesson from the retreat ("the quiet power of letting go, of
    breathing through the chaos"), performing a concrete changed behavior (sets the
    phone down and opts to wait until morning), and having her mother notice ("That''s
    new"). These additions create a clear contrast with her pre-journey self and demonstrate
    integration of the retreat''s insight. Changes were minimal and surgical: original
    beats and sentences largely retained, with an inserted reflective/actional paragraph
    and a brief line from the mother; no required elements were removed.'
