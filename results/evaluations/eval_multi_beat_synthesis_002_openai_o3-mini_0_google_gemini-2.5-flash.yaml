  - 'Beat 3 (Approach to the Inmost Cave) - Recognition of what reaching the stronghold
    will cost or change: While there''s a line about ''each step taken had cost her
    pieces of the past life she knew,'' it feels a bit generic and doesn''t deeply
    explore the specific cost or change related to *reaching the stronghold* itself,
    but rather the journey overall. It''s a minor miss, but not as explicit as other
    elements.'
