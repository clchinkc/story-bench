  evidence: All four three-act beats are clearly present (Act 1 setup with inciting
    incident and first plot point; Act 2A midpoint/false victory; Act 2B complications
    and second plot point; Act 3 climax and denouement). All eight required elements
    are preserved. I deducted 0.1 from the tone score because, while the piece generally
    sustains a quiet, redemptive Japanese aesthetic, it could lean slightly more into
    restraint and evocative sensory detail to fully match the requested tone.
