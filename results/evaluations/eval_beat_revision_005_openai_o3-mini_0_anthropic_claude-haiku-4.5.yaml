  evidence: "The model completely failed the primary task. Instead of recognizing\
    \ that the original segment was correctly executed and required NO revision, the\
    \ model provided a heavily rewritten version. The rewrite substantially modifies\
    \ the original text\u2014expanding it, adding new phrases like 'as if stepping\
    \ out of life and into eternity,' 'subtle shudder,' 'weight of mortality pressing\
    \ down,' 'silent reckoning with loss so profound it spoke of endings,' and 'hint\
    \ of the inevitable.' While the model demonstrated solid understanding of Dark\
    \ Night of the Soul beat requirements (isolation, despair, reflection, no solutions,\
    \ mortality element), it committed a critical false positive error by treating\
    \ a well-executed segment as if it needed improvement. The model should have stated\
    \ 'NO REVISION NEEDED' and explained why the original already satisfied all requirements.\
    \ Instead, it over-diagnosed and over-revised, which is precisely the error this\
    \ evaluation was designed to catch."
