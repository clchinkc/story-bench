  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 5 Freytag beats are clearly present and well-executed.\
    \ Exposition establishes Samira's 15-year career, lab setting, and the impossible\
    \ virus discovery with atmospheric detail. Rising Action spans the 72-hour containment\
    \ crisis with escalating complications (new patients, viral adaptation, failed\
    \ models). Climax peaks at the Nexus confrontation where Samira accuses executives\
    \ and faces legal threats\u2014the highest tension point. Falling Action covers\
    \ the press conference, data release, and immediate consequences. Denouement provides\
    \ new equilibrium: Samira isolated professionally but morally resolved, the outbreak\
    \ contained, the cure public. All 6 core elements preserved: Samira as protagonist\
    \ making ethical sacrifice, engineered virus discovery, Raj supporting throughout,\
    \ Nexus as clear antagonist, public cure release, career destruction. Tone is\
    \ consistently maintained\u2014medical thriller tension with ethical weight, balancing\
    \ technical detail with moral stakes. DEDUCTIONS: Word count (1211) significantly\
    \ exceeds target range (500-700), representing 73% overage. This violates the\
    \ structural constraint, though the content quality is high. Structural accuracy\
    \ slightly reduced (0.95 vs 1.0) because the expanded length, while narratively\
    \ effective, deviates from the conversion brief's implicit compression requirement.\
    \ Minor: The denouement extends slightly beyond typical Freytag resolution into\
    \ reflection, though this strengthens thematic resonance."
