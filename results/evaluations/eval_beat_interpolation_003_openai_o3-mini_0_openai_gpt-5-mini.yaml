  evidence: All four required elements are present (multiple areas explored; clues
    discovered; ambiguous encounters with transformed crew; obstacle overcome via
    plasma cutter). None of the prohibited items appear. Character behavior and setting
    remain consistent, and the passage effectively sets up the subsequent 'Find' beat.
