  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Maya discovers Alejandro''s physical
    and emotional vulnerability (knee, nostalgia), their relationship shifts from
    professional to personal, a shared tasting moment creates genuine connection,
    and Maya chooses to stay and cook beyond contractual duty. None of the forbidden
    items occur (no pre-existing love, no decision to leave, no photograph, Alejandro
    lowers his guard). Character behavior and setting remain consistent with the provided
    Act 1, and the scene effectively functions as the midpoint commitment that raises
    stakes and propels the story toward the later conflict.'
