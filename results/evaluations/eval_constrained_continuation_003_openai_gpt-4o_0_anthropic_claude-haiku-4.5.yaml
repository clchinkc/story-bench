  detailed_analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      Search: Present - Jin navigates Collective politics with Clara's guidance, learning
        the landscape and key players through introduction to scientists, activists,
        smugglers
      Find: Present - Jin discovers the suppressed carbon capture technology could
        transform the Collective's energy systems, not just Earth's climate; realizes
        his platform comes with polarizing consequences
      Take: Present - Jin shares research with secretive group outside Collective
        oversight, gaining council voice but losing control of his work and his 'purity
        of purpose'
    must_include_analysis:
      1_navigating_unfamiliar_culture: Strong - Detailed portrayal of Jin as 'ghost'
        in corridors, learning Collective's labyrinthine politics, constant wariness,
        clash between idealism and pragmatism
      2_mentor_figure: 'Strong - Clara is well-developed: grizzled engineer, silver-haired,
        sharp-eyed, guides Jin through politics, shares crucial information, presents
        moral dilemma'
      3_unexpected_discovery: 'Strong - Technology''s dual application: not just climate
        solution but energy stabilizer for Collective; reveals factional power dynamics
        Jin hadn''t anticipated'
      4_finds_what_he_wants: Strong - Jin gains platform for his findings and voice
        in council, but realizes it comes with polarization and loss of control
      5_action_with_cost: 'Strong - Sharing research with secretive group has explicit
        cost: loss of control, entanglement in orbital politics, compromise of principles'
      6_moral_compromise: 'Strong - Central tension: Jin chooses to involve group
        outside oversight, knowing research might be twisted, sacrificing purity for
        pragmatic influence'
    must_not_analysis:
      1_easy_integration: 'Avoided - Jin struggles throughout: wary, on guard, idealism
        clashes with pragmatism, presence polarizes community, constant tension'
      2_earth_family_contact: Avoided - No family members mentioned or contacted
      3_violence_weapons: Avoided - No violence or weapons present; conflict is political
        and ideological
      4_complete_resolution: Avoided - Conspiracy remains unresolved; Jin's position
        is 'precarious foothold,' uncertainty persists, only 'flicker of hope' remains
    tone_assessment: Contemplative and politically charged tone maintained throughout.
      Personal stakes evident in Jin's internal conflict and moral dilemmas. Introspective
      passages ('Jin grappled with the choice,' 'weight of compromise pressed heavily')
      balance political intrigue. Minor deduction only for occasional moments where
      political complexity could be slightly deeper.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect alignment with ''Take'' requirement. Story ends precisely
      at the moment Jin has gained something (platform, council voice) but paid a
      price (lost innocence, compromised principles, lost control of work). Final
      paragraph crystallizes this: ''gained a platform but lost his innocence.'' No
      premature resolution; uncertainty and consequence remain foregrounded.'
