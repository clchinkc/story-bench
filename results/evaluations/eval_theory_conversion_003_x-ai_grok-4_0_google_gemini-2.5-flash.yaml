  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the three-act
    structure. Act 1 covers the setup, inciting incident (Yuki's letter), and the
    first plot point (Kenji going to Kyoto). Act 2A introduces Haruki and the initial
    bonding with Yuki, leading to the Midpoint (festival, business offer). Act 2B
    handles the complications (Yuki's discovery, uninvitation) and the second plot
    point (Kenji's decision to decline the offer). Act 3 provides the climax (Kenji
    at the wedding, conversation with Yuki) and the denouement (bamboo shop, new life).
    The word count is slightly over the specified range. The structural accuracy is
    good, but the transition between Act 2A and 2B could be slightly more distinct
    in terms of a clear 'second plot point' event, though the 'All Is Lost' moment
    serves this purpose well.
