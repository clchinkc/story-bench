  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and excellently executed:
    (1) Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability—his anosmia/ageusia from concussion,
    his emotional isolation; (2) Relationship shifts from professional to personal—she
    moves from ''not her business'' to intimate engagement; (3) Shared moment creates
    genuine connection—the soup scene and balcony conversation establish mutual understanding
    and trust; (4) Maya commits beyond contract—she explicitly chooses to stay ''because
    you want to,'' reframing her presence from obligation to desire. The beat perfectly
    executes Act 2 Midpoint function: raises emotional stakes, shifts Maya from reactive
    (cooking per contract) to proactive (cooking to heal), creates point of no return
    in their connection. All must-not items avoided: they''re not already in love
    (connection is nascent), Maya doesn''t leave or breach contract, photograph isn''t
    taken during this scene, Alejandro''s walls genuinely lower. Character voice is
    consistent—Maya''s quiet competence, Alejandro''s guarded vulnerability. Bridge
    is seamless: BEFORE establishes contract/stakes; GENERATED shows emotional breakthrough;
    AFTER reveals the photograph consequence. Setting continuity perfect: balcony
    established in BEFORE, used meaningfully here. ONLY ISSUE: Word count (785) significantly
    exceeds 300-450 range by 74%, though this excess serves the narrative depth and
    emotional resonance required for a midpoint beat. The prose quality and narrative
    function justify the overage, but technical requirement is violated.'
