  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated: (1) You—opening
    paragraph establishes Zoe''s library sanctuary and invisibility; (2) Need—''hollowness
    to that safety'' and inability to connect with living souls; (3) Go—accepts recorder
    and crosses threshold to Bernard''s porch; (4) Search—''clumsy and painful'' interview
    attempts, mother''s pressure, technical struggles; (5) Find—breakthrough moment
    with Bernard where silence changes and listening becomes courage; (6) Take—town
    hall presentation where Zoe takes microphone and carries Bernard''s voice; (7)
    Return—summer ends, routine returns, but ''silence is different now''; (8) Change—funeral
    speech and journalism school application demonstrate sustained transformation.
    All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history
    program, Ms. Okafor (initiating figure), Bernard Park (key relationship), social
    anxiety (throughout), town hall presentation (climactic scene), Bernard''s death
    (October), journalism school (ending). Tone is consistently gentle, intimate,
    and emotionally true—introspective language (''dusty, sunlit silence,'' ''fortress
    of solitude''), vulnerable character voice, and earned emotional moments. Minor
    deduction (0.05) for structural accuracy: the ''Return'' beat could be slightly
    more distinct as a separate phase rather than flowing into ''Change,'' though
    the current approach is narratively sophisticated. Minor tone deduction (0.05):
    one phrase (''heavy and dangerous'') slightly shifts toward melodrama but recovers
    quickly.'
