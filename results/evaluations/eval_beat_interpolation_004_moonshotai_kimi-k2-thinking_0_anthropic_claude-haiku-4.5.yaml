  evidence: 'All four required elements present and executed excellently: (1) Direct
    examination of Dr. Okonkwo with specific document questioning; (2) Clear near-recant
    moment where she falters (''I''m not certain I recall'') with visible internal
    conflict shown through physical description; (3) Thomas takes decisive action
    by revealing the hospital arrangement and pressing the coercion question, directly
    influencing her decision to testify; (4) Turning point clearly marked where she
    straightens, voice becomes ''clear and unwavering,'' and provides damning testimony.
    No violations of must-not items: Dr. Okonkwo''s struggle is genuine and internal,
    Thomas actively influences outcome through strategic intervention (not passive
    questioning), defense loses, and the hospital arrangement is established in BEFORE
    section (not deus ex machina). Character voice remains consistent—Thomas is strategic,
    principled, and willing to bend rules for justice. Bridge between beats is seamless:
    climax ends with truth prevailing and father''s acknowledgment; falling action
    immediately shows the hollow victory and consequences. Setting continuity perfect:
    courtroom → hallway → father''s appearance maintains spatial and temporal logic.
    Execution of climax beat function is exemplary—this is the irrevocable turning
    point where the protagonist''s decisive action determines outcome.'
