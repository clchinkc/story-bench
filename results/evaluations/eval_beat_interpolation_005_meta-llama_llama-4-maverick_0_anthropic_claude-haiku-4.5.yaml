  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Maya
    discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability through his abuela story and emotional openness;
    (2) relationship shifts from professional (contract-focused) to personal (emotional
    intimacy); (3) shared moment of connection over tortilla española with eye contact
    and vulnerability; (4) Maya''s commitment deepens beyond money—she chooses to
    stay for Alejandro, not the salary. BEAT EXECUTION: Perfectly executes Act 2 Midpoint
    function—raises emotional stakes, shifts Maya from reactive (just earning money)
    to proactive (choosing connection), creates point of no return in her emotional
    journey. The ''I''ll make it again'' line is the exact commitment beat needed.
    MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS: Zero violations. They are not in love yet (connection is
    nascent), Maya doesn''t decide to leave, photograph isn''t taken during scene,
    Alejandro''s walls DO lower (abuela story, softened voice, vulnerability). CONSISTENCY:
    Character voices authentic—Alejandro''s guarded-to-vulnerable arc, Maya''s professional-to-personal
    shift. BRIDGE: Seamlessly connects BEFORE (contract signing, financial motivation)
    to AFTER (photograph scandal, forced departure)—the intimacy hinted here becomes
    the scandal''s evidence. CONTINUITY: Villa setting maintained, timeline coherent,
    emotional progression logical.'
