  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed: (1) Maya\
    \ discovers Alejandro's vulnerability through his abuela story and emotional openness;\
    \ (2) relationship shifts from professional (contract-focused) to personal (emotional\
    \ intimacy); (3) shared moment of connection over tortilla espa\xF1ola with eye\
    \ contact and vulnerability; (4) Maya's commitment deepens beyond money\u2014\
    she chooses to stay for Alejandro, not the salary. BEAT EXECUTION: Perfectly executes\
    \ Act 2 Midpoint function\u2014raises emotional stakes, shifts Maya from reactive\
    \ (just earning money) to proactive (choosing connection), creates point of no\
    \ return in her emotional journey. The 'I'll make it again' line is the exact\
    \ commitment beat needed. MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS: Zero violations. They are not in\
    \ love yet (connection is nascent), Maya doesn't decide to leave, photograph isn't\
    \ taken during scene, Alejandro's walls DO lower (abuela story, softened voice,\
    \ vulnerability). CONSISTENCY: Character voices authentic\u2014Alejandro's guarded-to-vulnerable\
    \ arc, Maya's professional-to-personal shift. BRIDGE: Seamlessly connects BEFORE\
    \ (contract signing, financial motivation) to AFTER (photograph scandal, forced\
    \ departure)\u2014the intimacy hinted here becomes the scandal's evidence. CONTINUITY:\
    \ Villa setting maintained, timeline coherent, emotional progression logical."
