  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly mapped: (1) You—opening
    establishes Zoe''s library sanctuary and social anxiety; (2) Need—''something
    shifted'' reveals her isolation and fear of living; (3) Go—Ms. Okafor''s challenge
    and recorder push her into unfamiliar territory; (4) Search—multiple interviews
    show adaptation (''stopped reading from index cards''); (5) Find—Bernard''s trust
    and the revelation about Korea represent breakthrough; (6) Take—town hall presentation
    is the price paid (vulnerability, public speaking); (7) Return—summer ends, life
    resumes, Bernard''s death marks closure; (8) Change—journalism applications and
    final paragraph demonstrate transformation (''could stand before strangers'').
    All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe (protagonist), library setting, oral history
    program, Ms. Okafor (initiator), Bernard Park (key relationship), social anxiety
    (threaded throughout), town hall (climactic scene), Bernard''s death and journalism
    school (ending). Tone is consistently gentle and intimate with emotional authenticity.
    Minor deduction (0.05) for structural accuracy: the ''Take'' beat slightly blurs
    with ''Find'' in execution, though both are present. Tone deduction (0.05): one
    phrase (''more vulnerable than speaking'') edges toward philosophical abstraction
    rather than pure intimate voice, though overall maintains warmth and specificity.'
