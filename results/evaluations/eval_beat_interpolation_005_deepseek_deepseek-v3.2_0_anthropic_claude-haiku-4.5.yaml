  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently:
    (1) Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability through his ''El Muro'' confession
    about his father''s death and emotional walls; (2) Relationship shifts from professional
    (meals left in warming oven, no contact) to personal (midnight kitchen scene,
    shared meal); (3) Genuine connection created through the tortilla española moment—intimate
    but not romantic, grounded in empathy and recognition of loneliness; (4) Maya
    makes explicit commitment choice (''The contract says I cook for you. It doesn''t
    say I have to let you eat alone'') that transcends the original financial motivation.
    BEAT EXECUTION: Perfectly executes Act 2 Midpoint function—raises emotional stakes,
    shifts Maya from reactive employee to proactive emotional participant, creates
    point of no return in their dynamic. The shared fork and silence represent genuine
    commitment beyond contract. MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS: Zero violations. No premature
    love declaration, no intimacy beyond forehead-touching (saved for photograph reveal),
    no contract breach decision, no wall remaining unbroken. CHARACTERIZATION: Maya''s
    voice remains steady and compassionate; Alejandro''s vulnerability feels earned
    and specific (not generic). BRIDGE: Seamlessly connects BEFORE (contract signing,
    financial motivation) to AFTER (photograph scandal, forced separation)—the intimacy
    built here justifies the scandal''s impact. CONTINUITY: Kitchen setting maintained,
    timeline logical (3 weeks → midnight scene), Lucia''s instructions referenced,
    storm provides atmospheric coherence.'
