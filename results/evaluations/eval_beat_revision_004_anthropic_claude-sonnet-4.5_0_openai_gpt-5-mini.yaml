  evidence: 'The model addressed the core flaw (exposition that was ''telling'' rather
    than ''showing'') by converting the info-dump into a lived scene: Rachel actively
    spreads cold-case files, points out inconsistencies, and interacts with James
    via dialogue, while sensory details (October light, dust motes, cold coffee) ground
    the precinct setting. The cat and Queens apartment are shown naturally. All five
    required elements and the four required phrases/concepts are preserved. Changes
    were substantial (scene rewrite rather than minor edits), hence a low minimal_change_score,
    but the revision successfully fixes the identified problem with strong prose and
    no new errors.'
