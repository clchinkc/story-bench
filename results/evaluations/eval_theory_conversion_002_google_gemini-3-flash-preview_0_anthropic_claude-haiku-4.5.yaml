  evidence: 'All 12 Hero''s Journey beats are explicitly present and well-developed:
    (1) Ordinary World—Maya''s coastal pottery life; (2) Call to Adventure—the dried
    spring and elders'' request; (3) Refusal—''I cannot speak to the earth''; (4)
    Meeting the Mentor—grandmother''s journal across time; (5) Crossing Threshold—journey
    into High Peaks; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—mountain air, exhaustion, journal as
    ally; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave—reaching the shrine ruins; (8) Ordeal—midnight
    clay work and failure leading to surrender; (9) Reward—the asymmetrical vessel;
    (10) Road Back—treacherous descent protecting the piece; (11) Resurrection—proving
    transformation at the spring ceremony; (12) Return with Elixir—water returns,
    Maya transformed. All 7 core elements preserved: Maya (protagonist), pottery/ceramics
    (central), grandmother''s legacy (journal, shrine), mountain shrine journey (detailed),
    dried spring (catalyst and resolution), surrender theme (climactic revelation),
    transformation (complete arc). Tone is consistently quiet, meditative, and transformative
    throughout—lyrical language (''long, elegant shadow,'' ''centuries-old song,''
    ''silent music''), introspective moments, and spiritual depth maintained. Minor
    deductions: word count exceeds range by 33 words (833 vs. 800 max), and structural
    accuracy slightly reduced because the ''Enemies'' beat is somewhat implicit rather
    than explicitly personified (though internal resistance and mountain conditions
    serve this function adequately).'
