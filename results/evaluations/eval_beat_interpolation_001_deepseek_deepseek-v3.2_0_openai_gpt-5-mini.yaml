  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Marcus is introduced by name;
    he provides practical wisdom and tools (satchel, compass, guidance on reading
    the Thornwood); Elena''s refusal softens into reluctant curiosity (hand closes
    on compass; internal question ''What if I can read this?''); and her librarian
    skills are explicitly framed as useful. None of the prohibited items occur: Elena
    does not become immediately confident, Marcus refuses to accompany her and does
    not solve her problems, the scene is not set in/near the forest, and Elena does
    not discover magical powers. Character voice and continuity are consistent and
    the scene effectively sets up the crossing of the threshold.'
