  evidence: 'All 12 Campbell beats are represented: Ordinary World (studio life),
    Call to Adventure (elder''s request), Refusal (Maya''s denial), Meeting the Mentor
    (grandmother''s memory/journal), Crossing the Threshold (leaving village/ascending
    mountain), Tests/Allies/Enemies (journey, wind, failed attempts—though no explicit
    allies), Approach to the Inmost Cave (ruined shrine), Ordeal (initial failure
    and emotional collapse), Reward (creating the true vessel), The Road Back (treacherous
    descent/storm), Resurrection (ritual release and water''s return), Return with
    the Elixir (spring restored, Maya transformed). All 7 required elements are preserved.
    Minor deductions: ''Meeting the Mentor'' functions via memory/journal rather than
    a distinct living mentor, and the Tests/Allies/Enemies beat lacks explicit allies;
    tone is very close to the requested quiet, meditative, transformative style but
    occasionally leans slightly more dramatic. Also the provided word_count (865)
    is outside the target 600–800 range.'
