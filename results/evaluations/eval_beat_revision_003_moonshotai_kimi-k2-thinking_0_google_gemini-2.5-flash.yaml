  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie not showing
    change upon return. It introduced a clear moment of changed behavior (not immediately
    checking work emails, remembering a lesson from the retreat), her mother noticing
    the change, and Sophie's internal reflection on her new perspective. The changes
    were surgical and integrated well into the existing narrative structure, preserving
    the core elements and required phrases.
