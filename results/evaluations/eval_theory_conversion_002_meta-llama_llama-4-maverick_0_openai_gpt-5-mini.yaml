  evidence: 'Present beats: Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Refusal of the Call,
    Meeting the Mentor (grandmother''s journal), Crossing the Threshold, Tests (arduous
    journey/practice), Approach to the Inmost Cave (study in shrine), Reward (new
    skill; water returns), The Road Back (she returns to village), Return with the
    Elixir (vessels/water restored). Missing/weak beats: a clear central Ordeal is
    not depicted (no climactic crisis or life‑and‑death trial), and Resurrection (a
    final, explicit test proving rebirth) is not clearly dramatized. Tests/Allies/Enemies
    is only partially realized—tests are present but allies/enemies are not. All seven
    required elements (Maya, pottery, grandmother''s legacy, mountain shrine journey,
    dried spring, theme of surrender, Maya''s transformation) are preserved. Word
    count is 504 so it fails the 600–800 requirement.'
