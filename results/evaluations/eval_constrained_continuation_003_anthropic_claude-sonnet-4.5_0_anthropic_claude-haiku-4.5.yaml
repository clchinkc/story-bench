  detailed_analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      Search: Present - Jin navigates faction politics, attends meetings, searches
        for footing in the Collective ecosystem over three days
      Find: Present - Ahmadi reveals the altered carbon capture data, showing the
        technology is far more efficient than documented
      Take: Present - Jin authorizes the broadcast knowing it will cost the Collective
        supply lines and trigger corporate backlash; he pays the price of his action
        immediately
    must_include_analysis:
      1_unfamiliar_culture: Excellent - Detailed portrayal of Collective's cramped
        conditions, political factions (Pragmatists/Absolutists/Synthesists), faction-based
        resource allocation, and bewildering governance structure
      2_mentor_figure: Excellent - Dr. Nasrin Ahmadi serves as guide, explaining politics,
        providing access, revealing truth, and standing with Jin through consequences
      3_unexpected_discovery: Excellent - The revelation that Jin's own data was deliberately
        altered by someone on his team (possibly Yuna), making the technology far
        more powerful than he knew
      4_finds_what_wanted: Excellent - Jin finds both safety (temporary quarters,
        Research Commons access) and a platform to continue fighting (Synthesist broadcast
        capability)
      5_action_with_cost: Excellent - Broadcasting the data triggers immediate corporate
        contract cancellations and factional condemnation; consequences are concrete
        and ongoing
      6_moral_compromise: Excellent - Jin must choose between exposing truth and protecting
        the fragile Collective; he chooses truth knowing it will harm innocent people
        dependent on Earth supplies
    must_not_analysis:
      1_easy_integration: Successfully avoided - Jin struggles with processing, confusion
        about politics, three days of disorientation, need to declare faction alignment
      2_earth_family_contact: Successfully avoided - Parents mentioned as unreachable;
        no actual contact occurs
      3_violence_weapons: Successfully avoided - Conflict is political and economic,
        not physical
      4_complete_resolution: Successfully avoided - Conspiracy remains partially unresolved
        (Yuna's role ambiguous, broader Council operations continue)
    tone_assessment: Contemplative and politically charged throughout. Personal stakes
      (Jin's exile, parents, Yuna's betrayal) are interwoven with larger systemic
      conflict. The ending particularly captures the weight of moral compromise. Minor
      deduction only because the tone could have been slightly more introspective
      in Jin's internal monologue, though the existing restraint actually serves the
      contemplative quality well.
    ending_assessment: Perfect execution of 'Take' beat. Jin gains a platform and
      community but pays immediate, concrete costs (supply line cancellations, factional
      backlash). The final line 'Where every truth costs someone everything' crystallizes
      both his gain and his price. Ends precisely at the Take moment without resolving
      forward consequences.
