  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to show
    Sophie's transformation upon returning. It addressed this by having Sophie consciously
    choose to respond differently to work stress, explicitly referencing a lesson
    from her retreat ('sit with discomfort instead of immediately reacting'), and
    showing her mother noticing the change ('Really?'). The changes were surgical,
    adding new dialogue and internal monologue to demonstrate the transformation,
    while retaining the core structure and events of the original segment. The word
    count is within the valid range.
