  evidence: The story successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the Three-Act Structure.
    Act 1 covers Kenji's setup, the inciting incident (Yuki's letter), and his decision
    to go to Kyoto. Act 2A introduces Haruki and the initial healing, leading to the
    midpoint where he sees Yuki's independent life. Act 2B brings the temptation of
    the business deal, Yuki's rejection, and Kenji's realization (second plot point).
    Act 3 covers his apology, witnessing the wedding, and the resolution of his new
    life. The structural accuracy is good, but the transition between Act 2A and 2B
    could be slightly more distinct in terms of escalating conflict directly tied
    to the main plot (Yuki's wedding/relationship). The 'Bad Guys Close In' equivalent
    (the business offer) feels a bit sudden rather than a natural escalation of the
    existing conflict with Yuki.
