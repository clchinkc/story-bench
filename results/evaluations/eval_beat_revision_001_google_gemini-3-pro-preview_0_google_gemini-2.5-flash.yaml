  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The Ordeal
    as a mere boss battle and not a transformative crisis. It successfully revised
    the segment to include Kira's deepest fear (guilt over her brother's death), a
    symbolic 'death' moment where she surrenders to the darkness, a clear rebirth/transformation,
    and a victory stemming from new understanding rather than just persistence. The
    changes were significant enough to fix the flaw but maintained the core structure
    and key elements of the original, demonstrating a good balance of revision and
    preservation.
