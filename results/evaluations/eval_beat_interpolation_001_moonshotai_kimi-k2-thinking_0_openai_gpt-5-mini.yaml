  evidence: All four required elements are present (Marcus introduced; practical tools
    and wisdom given; Elena's doubt shifts toward reluctant acceptance; librarian
    skills explicitly referenced). No must-not items occur. Character voices and behaviors
    are consistent and the scene links cleanly between the prior refusal and the upcoming
    threshold, so no deductions were necessary.
