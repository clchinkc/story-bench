  evidence: 'The revision clearly targets the All Is Lost problem: it removes key
    options/support (Denise admits she failed to submit the grant paperwork; board
    members have resigned), adds a ''whiff of death'' (Marcus''s wife is described
    as gone), and ends with Marcus isolated and defeated. That diagnosis is correct.
    However, it does not explicitly address the fundraiser (no line stating it failed
    or became impossible), and there is a continuity/credibility problem: the wife''s
    comforting text remains in the scene while later stating she died three months
    ago, which undercuts the emotional impact. Changes are moderate — original lines
    and structure are largely preserved, but several new revelations and a bleak coda
    were inserted rather than performing tiny surgical edits.'
