  evidence: "STRENGTHS: The Debate beat is present with Sarah wrestling with three\
    \ distinct options (recanting, official channels, going rogue). Internal conflict\
    \ between duty and sisterly love is well-articulated. The diner scene with Marcus\
    \ provides external perspective that catalyzes her decision. Character voice remains\
    \ consistent and compelling throughout. Bridge to Break Into Two is strong\u2014\
    the resignation letter directly follows her debate resolution. WEAKNESSES: Missing\
    \ explicit consideration of a fourth alternative or deeper exploration of the\
    \ 'easy choice' (recanting). VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah has already decided to resign\
    \ and go rogue by the end of this beat ('Sarah Chen\u2014former detective, current\
    \ vigilante'), which technically skips ahead into Break Into Two territory\u2014\
    the Debate should end with commitment to action, not action already taken. (2)\
    \ The AFTER section shows her already outside the captain's office with resignation\
    \ letter in hand, meaning the decision is made rather than being made during the\
    \ debate. This violates the spirit of the Debate beat, which should show the wrestling\
    \ process, not its completion. The beat execution is strong narratively but structurally\
    \ crosses into the next beat. Word count valid at 319 words."
