  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment treated The Ordeal
    as a mere boss battle and not a transformative crisis. It successfully introduced
    Kira's deepest fear (guilt over her brother's death), a symbolic 'death' moment
    where she gives up, a rebirth/transformation through new understanding, and a
    victory stemming from this insight rather than just persistence. The changes were
    significant enough to fix the flaw but maintained the core structure and many
    original phrases, demonstrating a good balance of revision and preservation.
