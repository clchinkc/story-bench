  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. Maya discovers Alejandro's
    vulnerability (the accident), their relationship shifts from professional to personal
    ('Because you matter to me'), they share a genuine connection over the tea and
    tortilla, and Maya's commitment deepens beyond the contract ('no longer here just
    for her grandmother's restaurant. She was here for him.'). All 'must not' items
    are successfully avoided. Character voices are consistent, and the scene seamlessly
    bridges the previous and subsequent beats.
