  evidence: "The model addressed the exact flaw: Sophie previously showed no lasting\
    \ change and immediately reverted to work habits. The revision makes her behave\
    \ differently (silences the phone, postpones responding, uses a breathing technique\
    \ learned at the retreat), gives a specific lesson/insight ('Some fires burn themselves\
    \ out if you stop fanning them.' and breathing like the monks taught), provides\
    \ a physical marker (phone face-down) and a visible contrast (she notices the\
    \ city differently and feels inner stillness). The mother notices ('blinked').\
    \ Changes are minimal and surgical\u2014core sentences and beats are preserved\
    \ while inserting brief, targeted lines to demonstrate transformation."
