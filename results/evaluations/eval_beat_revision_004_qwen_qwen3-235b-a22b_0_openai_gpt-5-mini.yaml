  evidence: 'The model addressed the actual flaw (telling vs. showing) by staging
    a scene: Rachel adjusts the crime board, handles a decade-old case file, exchanges
    dialogue with Detective James Oyelaran, and reacts to precinct noises and a notification
    showing her Queens apartment and cat. Sensory details (disinfectant tang, rain
    mist, microwave beep) and action reveal character traits and relationships rather
    than summarizing them. All five required story elements were preserved. Changes
    were moderate—the revision is a substantial rewrite to convert exposition into
    a scene rather than a few surgical edits. Word count exceeds the specified range
    (382 words), so word_count_valid is false.'
