  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - ''Things going according to plan (mostly)'': The plan deteriorates too
    quickly; the minor complication (Elena''s presence) is revealed at the end of
    Beat 1 rather than emerging gradually, making the ''mostly successful'' phase
    too compressed'
  - 'Cross-beat constraint - ''Chekhov''s Gun'': The magnetic decoupler is introduced
    and used within the same beat (Bad Guys Close In) rather than being established
    in Fun and Games and paid off later. The crushed glass detail from Beat 1 is never
    revisited or becomes critical in subsequent beats'
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional tonal escalation: playful confidence (''You scratch the paint, Sorokin
    notices'') → shaken confidence (Elena reveal) → genuine danger (sonic cannon,
    blast doors)'
  - 'Strong mentor presence arc: Elena moves from unknown → recognized on monitor
    → active threat with voice and deployed weapons'
  - 'Jax provides consistent crew member arc: enthusiastic participant → compromised/injured
    → becomes the moral choice point for Miri'
  - 'Excellent context maintenance: Monaco setting, Grand Prix cover, art history
    details (Madonna provenance), Ocean''s Eleven tone with clever banter intact'
  - 'Coherent narrative flow: Each beat builds logically; the revelation of Elena
    as antagonist recontextualizes the entire heist'
  - 'Strong character moment: Miri''s final choice (saving Jax over the painting)
    demonstrates her arc from criminal to conservator'
  - 'Vivid sensory details and pacing: The sonic cannon, blast doors, magnetic decoupler
    create visceral stakes'
  weaknesses:
  - Beat 1 (Fun and Games) lacks sufficient 'things going according to plan' phase—the
    complication arrives too early, compressing the playful heist portion
  - 'Chekhov''s Gun constraint partially missed: The crushed glass (Beat 1) is never
    revisited; the decoupler should have been introduced earlier to satisfy setup-payoff
    structure'
  - Beat 2 (Midpoint) is very brief—the false victory moment (painting secured) is
    immediately undercut by Elena's reveal, leaving little room for the 'stakes raised'
    to breathe
  - Party setting intensification (Beat 2 requirement) is mentioned but not deeply
    explored—the party above remains distant rather than creating mounting pressure
  calibration_notes: The story executes 13 of 15 beat requirements effectively, with
    only minor structural gaps. The two failed items are technical constraint violations
    rather than narrative failures. The writing quality is strong (1.0 level), but
    the structure slightly underserves the Fun and Games beat by rushing to the complication.
    Cross-beat score of 0.75 reflects solid execution of mentor presence, tonal escalation,
    and team dynamics, but the Chekhov's Gun constraint is only partially satisfied.
    Overall coherence is high because the narrative logic is sound despite structural
    compression.
