  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment lacked the internal,
    transformative aspects of The Ordeal. It addressed the need for Kira to confront
    her deepest fear (guilt over her brother's death), included a moment of symbolic
    'death' (her acceptance of guilt and feeling of worthlessness), and a subsequent
    rebirth/transformation (her brother's forgiving voice, leading to a new understanding
    and purpose). The victory then stems from this internal shift, not just persistence.
    The changes were surgical, adding dialogue and internal monologue to achieve the
    transformation while retaining much of the original action sequence. All required
    preserved phrases are present, and the four elements are preserved.
