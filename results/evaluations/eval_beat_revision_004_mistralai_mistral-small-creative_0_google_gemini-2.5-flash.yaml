  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment was 'telling'
    rather than 'showing' and revised it to demonstrate Rachel's character, relationships,
    and setting through action and dialogue. It shows her dedication to cold cases,
    her interaction with James, and sensory details of the precinct and Queens. The
    changes were extensive, essentially a rewrite, rather than minimal surgical edits,
    to achieve the 'showing' requirement. 'Tuesday morning in October' was changed
    to 'Tuesday morning chaos' and 'sliver of October sunlight'.
