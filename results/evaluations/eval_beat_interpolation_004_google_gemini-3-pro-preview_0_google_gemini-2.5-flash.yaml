  evidence: All required elements are present and all 'must not' items are avoided.
    The climax clearly functions as the turning point of the story, with Thomas's
    decisive action leading to Patricia's confession. Character voices and behavior
    are consistent, and the bridge between the BEFORE and AFTER beats is seamless.
    Setting continuity is perfectly maintained.
