  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The mentor, Marcus,
    is introduced, provides practical wisdom ('The forest tests intentions, not abilities')
    and tools (satchel, compass). Elena's doubt shifts to reluctant acceptance, and
    her librarian skills are explicitly referenced as useful. All 'must not' items
    are avoided. Character voice and continuity are excellent, and the bridge between
    beats is seamless.
