  evidence: The characterization of Alejandro is slightly softer than the 'notorious
    recluse, most difficult man' from the BEFORE beat, but it's a midpoint, so some
    softening is expected. The bridge is good, but the sudden shift in Alejandro's
    demeanor from 'notorious recluse' to 'cook what you want' could have been slightly
    more gradual or hinted at.
