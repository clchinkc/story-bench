  evidence: 'All five Freytag beats are clearly present and ordered (Exposition: Samira''s
    established life; Rising Action: quarantine, mounting cases, Nexus links; Climax:
    discovery of engineered virus and Nexus confrontation/decision to release cure;
    Falling Action: press conference and immediate fallout; Denouement: outbreak contained
    and new equilibrium). All six required elements are preserved (Samira protagonist,
    engineered virus, Raj, Nexus antagonist, public release of cure, career sacrifice).
    Tone remains a medical thriller with ethical weight throughout. No significant
    deductions.'
