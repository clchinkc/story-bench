  evidence: "All four required elements are present: Yuki explores multiple areas\
    \ (corridors, crew quarters, medical bay, mess hall), discovers clues (patient\
    \ log 'Dimensional integration successful', oxygen anomaly, crystallized syringes),\
    \ encounters transformed crew as mysterious apparitions/whispers, and faces obstacles\
    \ (sealed doors, sabotaged generators, a sliding panel). The scene functions clearly\
    \ as the Search beat\u2014gradual discovery, trials, and adaptation\u2014so execution\
    \ and character consistency score highly. No prohibited items appear (no immediate\
    \ data-core discovery or full explanations from the transformed crew; Yuki does\
    \ not leave; she did not know about the transformation prior to arrival). The\
    \ sole deduction is formal: the provided word count (557) exceeds the specified\
    \ 250\u2013400 range, so word_count_valid is false."
