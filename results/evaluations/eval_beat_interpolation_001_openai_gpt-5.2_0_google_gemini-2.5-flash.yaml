  evidence: All required elements are present and all 'must not' conditions are avoided.
    The narrative effectively executes the 'Meeting the Mentor' beat, showing Elena's
    reluctant acceptance and the mentor's guidance. Character voice and continuity
    are strong. The bridge from 'Refusal' to 'Meeting the Mentor' is well-handled,
    and the transition to 'Crossing the Threshold' is also smooth.
