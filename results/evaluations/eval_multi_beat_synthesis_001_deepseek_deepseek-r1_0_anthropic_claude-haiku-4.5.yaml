  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1: Preparation/gathering tools scene is minimal—Lena provides the vial but
    lacks a fuller preparation montage or information-gathering sequence'
  - 'Cross-beat constraint (Rising Stakes): Stakes escalate from Beat 1→2 adequately,
    but Beat 2→3 transition feels compressed; the tunnel descent and killer reveal
    happen too quickly without sufficient tension building'
  - 'Word count: 477 words vs. required 700-1000 (68% of minimum); story is significantly
    underdeveloped, particularly in Beat 2 (Approach to Inmost Cave) which receives
    only 2-3 sentences'
  detailed_scoring:
    beat_1_tests_allies_enemies:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied:
      - Dante encounters Lena who distrusts him initially ('junkie who sees pretty
        colors')
      - 'Test of ability under pressure: reading emotions through crimson mist during
        attack'
      - 'Enemy revealed: Marco as traitor working with killer (purple betrayal shards)'
      - Dante proves himself through his unique ability, gaining Lena's trust ('You
        saw what I couldn't')
      - 'Addiction/recovery referenced as strength: ''Sobriety lets me see clearly'''
      gaps:
      - Lena's initial distrust could be more developed; her thaw happens quickly
    beat_2_approach_inmost_cave:
      score: 0.7
      satisfied:
      - 'Planning scene: tunnel map, meeting location identified'
      - Dante recognizes confrontation requires facing sister's death guilt
      - 'Preparation: Lena gives Rosa''s vial (''For courage'')'
      - 'Moment of doubt: Dante freezes at threshold, guilt swirls at his feet'
      - 'Symbolic threshold: rusted service door, descent into underworld'
      gaps:
      - Beat 2 is severely compressed (only ~80 words); lacks depth in planning dialogue,
        emotional processing, or information gathering about the killer's methods
    beat_3_the_ordeal:
      score: 0.95
      satisfied:
      - 'Direct confrontation: killer emerges, Marco revealed as pawn'
      - 'Symbolic death: killer''s revelation about sister (''screamed your name''),
        guilt crashes over Dante, he buckles'
      - 'All seems lost: killer seizes Lena, machine activates with stolen emotions'
      - 'Transformation through acceptance: ''he couldn''t save his sister, but he
        could break the cycle'''
      - 'Victory through understanding: recognizes betrayal pattern powers device,
        uses vial strategically'
      gaps: []
    cross_beat_chekhov_gun:
      score: 1.0
      analysis: Rosa's vial introduced in Beat 2 as preparation tool becomes essential
        in Beat 3 to short-circuit the machine and defeat the killer. Excellent payoff.
    cross_beat_character_arc:
      score: 0.9
      analysis: 'Guilt progression: Beat 1 (mentioned as ''accusation stung''), Beat
        2 (recognized as obstacle—''descending into the night his sister died''),
        Beat 3 (transformed—''not as chains, but as compass points''). Arc is clear
        and satisfying, though could use more explicit emotional processing in Beat
        2.'
    cross_beat_rising_stakes:
      score: 0.6
      analysis: 'Beat 1→2: Stakes rise from personal accusation to planned confrontation
        with killer. Beat 2→3: Stakes should escalate dramatically but transition
        is abrupt. Killer''s revelation about sister is powerful, but the compressed
        timeline undermines tension building. Machine threat and Lena''s capture raise
        stakes, but pacing feels rushed.'
    cross_beat_ally_continuity:
      score: 1.0
      analysis: 'Lena present and essential throughout: gains trust in Beat 1, plans
        with Dante in Beat 2, fights alongside him in Beat 3, serves as emotional
        anchor (''her hand on his shoulder was an anchor''). Excellent continuity.'
    context_maintenance:
      score: 0.9
      analysis: 'Protagonist (Dante), setting (Buckingham Hotel, Chicago underworld),
        tone (noir-tinged, melancholic, redemptive) all maintained excellently. Resonant
        abilities clearly demonstrated. Serial killer threat established. Only minor:
        killer''s face remains obscured, limiting character depth.'
    coherence:
      score: 0.85
      analysis: Narrative flows logically across beats with strong emotional throughlines.
        Guilt motif weaves throughout. However, severe word count compression creates
        pacing issues—Beat 2 feels rushed, making the transition to Beat 3 feel abrupt
        rather than inevitable. Dialogue and sensory details are vivid but sparse.
  overall_assessment: Strong thematic execution and excellent beat structure within
    the compressed format. All major story elements present and functional. Primary
    weakness is word count (68% of minimum), which severely underdevelops Beat 2 and
    compresses rising stakes. The story demonstrates clear understanding of Hero's
    Journey and cross-beat constraints, but needs 200-300 additional words to fully
    realize its potential, particularly in the Approach to Inmost Cave beat.
