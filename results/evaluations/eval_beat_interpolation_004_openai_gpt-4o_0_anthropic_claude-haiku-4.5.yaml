  evidence: 'All four required elements present and well-executed: (1) Direct examination
    of Dr. Okonkwo with specific questions about her role, trials, and adverse reactions;
    (2) Clear near-recant moment—''dangerously close to recanting,'' hesitation, faltering
    voice, eyes ''betrayed a storm of conflict''; (3) Thomas takes decisive action
    by appealing to her values (''for your daughter,'' ''the truth can set you free'')
    and leaning in with steady eye contact, directly influencing her decision; (4)
    Turning point clearly marked—she commits to truth, confesses to falsification,
    courtroom erupts, ''damage was done,'' ''path to justice was clear.'' All must-not
    items avoided: Dr. Okonkwo shows genuine internal struggle before confession;
    Thomas actively influences outcome through persuasion; defense loses; no external
    deus ex machina. Character voice consistent with prior beats—Thomas strategic
    yet emotionally invested, Dr. Okonkwo conflicted and vulnerable. Bridge seamless:
    BEFORE establishes her fear and hesitation, GENERATED shows Thomas navigating
    that fear to extract truth, AFTER shows consequences. Minor deduction (0.05) on
    character score for Thomas''s dialogue being slightly more formal than his internal
    voice in BEFORE section. Continuity perfect: same courtroom, same judge (Mendez
    introduced naturally), same stakes, same characters.'
