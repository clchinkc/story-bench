  evidence: "All four required elements are present: (1) Sarah considers recanting,\
    \ (2) she considers official channels, (3) internal conflict between duty and\
    \ sister is explicit, (4) a conversation with Marcus propels her toward the third\
    \ option. The scene performs the Debate beat well\u2014options weighed, outside\
    \ counsel sought, and a commitment forms at the end. No prohibited items appear:\
    \ she does not immediately decide to go rogue without debate, no one else makes\
    \ the decision for her, she has not already resigned (only drafts a resignation,\
    \ which is an acceptable tipping action), and there is no direct confrontation\
    \ with Marchetti. The only formal issue is length: the provided text exceeds the\
    \ 250\u2013400 word range, so word_count_valid is false."
