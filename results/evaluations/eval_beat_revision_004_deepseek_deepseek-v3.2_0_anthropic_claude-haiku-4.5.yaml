  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: the original segment was
    pure exposition-through-telling (info-dump style) with no scene, action, or sensory
    grounding. The revision transforms this into SHOWN exposition through: (1) A concrete
    scene with Rachel at her cubicle examining the cold case board, (2) Dialogue with
    James that reveals their 3-year partnership dynamic and mutual respect naturally,
    (3) Rachel''s detective instincts and obsession with unsolved cases demonstrated
    through her behavior (refusing to close Jenkins file), (4) Sensory details (bitter
    precinct coffee, saxophone, faded photographs, demanding meow), (5) The apartment
    scene showing her solitary life devoted to work. All 4 required phrases are present:
    ''Detective Rachel Torres,'' ''Detective James Oyelaran,'' ''cat named Sherlock,''
    ''Tuesday morning in October.'' All 5 preserved elements intact. The changes were
    substantial but necessary—the original ~400-word info-dump was compressed to 212
    words of active scene, which represents moderate-to-significant restructuring
    rather than surgical edits. However, this level of change was appropriate given
    the severity of the flaw. The revision successfully establishes the ordinary world
    before disruption, creates investment in Rachel''s character through action, and
    ends with a hook (''Tomorrow, everything would change'') that signals the inciting
    incident. Writing quality is professional with no new errors. Minor: the phrase
    ''a familiar rhythm to their three-year partnership'' slightly tells rather than
    purely shows, but this is minimal and acceptable within the scene-based approach.'
