  evidence: 'All four three-act beats are identifiable: Act 1 (Tokyo loss, letter,
    decision to go to Kyoto), Act 2A (village integration, meeting Haruki, festival
    as midpoint), Act 2B (investor temptation, discovery by Yuki as second plot point),
    Act 3 (declining deal, apology, wedding aftermath, opening shop). All eight required
    elements are present and clearly preserved. Minor deductions: the Midpoint could
    be a stronger structural reversal (it functions more as a quiet realization than
    a formal turning point), and the tone, while very well maintained, loses a sliver
    of the austere Japanese minimalism in a few explanatory lines; these are small
    issues in an otherwise faithful conversion.'
