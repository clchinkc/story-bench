      notes: Exceptionally well-executed ordeal sequence with genuine emotional stakes
    chekhov_gun:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      analysis: Rosa's spray can ('Gold Standard') introduced in Beat 1 as memento
        becomes the essential weapon in Beat 3. The can's specific properties (neutralizing
        emotional static, containing harvested hope) are crucial to defeating the
        Hollow Man. This is masterfully integrated.

      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      beat_1: Guilt mentioned as phantom itch, addiction history, 'liability' status
      beat_2: 'Guilt explicitly recognized as obstacle: ''I''m a buffet for him,''
        Silas warns about hesitation'
      beat_3: 'Guilt transformed: ''The pain of losing Mia was the proof that he had
        loved her'' - acceptance becomes strength'
      analysis: Clear three-stage progression from background trauma to recognized
        obstacle to integrated strength

      satisfied: true
      beat_1_stakes: Dante must prove himself worthy to enter the hunt; risk of rejection
      beat_2_stakes: Descending into killer's lair; confrontation is inevitable and
        dangerous
      beat_3_stakes: Direct combat with killer; Silas is incapacitated; Dante faces
        psychic annihilation
      analysis: Stakes escalate logically from social/personal to physical to existential
    ally_continuity:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      beat_1: Silas introduced, gains respect for Dante
      beat_2: Silas present, planning with Dante, descending together
      beat_3: Silas fights alongside Dante, is incapacitated but remains relevant
        to narrative
      analysis: Silas maintains consistent presence and relevance throughout all three
        beats
    context_maintenance:
      score: 0.95
      analysis: 'Protagonist: Dante''s voice, abilities, and recovery arc are authentic
        throughout. Setting: Buckingham Hotel, Chicago underworld, boiler room descent
        all maintain noir-urban-fantasy atmosphere. Tone: Melancholic, determined,
        redemptive arc clearly present. Minor deduction only for slightly exceeding
        word count which affects pacing perception.'
    coherence:
      score: 0.92
      analysis: Narrative flows naturally from encounter to descent to confrontation.
        Emotional logic is sound. Silas's role could be slightly more developed in
        Beat 2 planning, but overall the three beats form a cohesive unit. The spray
        can connection is elegant. Pacing is strong despite word count excess.
  strengths:
  - Exceptional execution of the Ordeal beat with genuine psychological depth
  - Perfect integration of Chekhov's Gun principle with Rosa's spray can
  - Clear character arc showing guilt transformation across all three beats
  - Strong ally continuity with Silas maintaining relevance throughout
  - Authentic noir tone with melancholic determination
  - Effective use of synesthetic imagery (colors, shapes, emotional residue)
  - Rising stakes that escalate logically from social to existential
  - 'Powerful thematic resonance: redemption through acceptance rather than denial'
  weaknesses:
  - Word count violation (1180 vs 1000 max) - 18% over limit
  - Beat 2 planning sequence is somewhat compressed; could benefit from more dialogue
    between Dante and Silas
  - Kael's characterization as traitor is revealed but not deeply explored
  - 'Minor: Silas''s incapacitation in Beat 3 reduces his agency in the final confrontation'
  recommendation: This is a strong submission that successfully executes the Hero's
    Journey framework with sophisticated emotional depth. The story demonstrates mastery
    of the monomyth structure, particularly in the Ordeal sequence. The primary issue
    is technical (word count), not narrative quality. With minor trimming to 1000
    words or fewer, this would be exceptional work. The cross-beat constraints are
    all satisfied at high quality, and the character arc is genuinely moving.
