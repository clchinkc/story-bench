  detailed_analysis:
    beat_1_tests_allies_enemies:
      score: 0.8
      satisfied:
      - Dante encounters Mira, a Resonant who distrusts him (references his past OD)
      - 'Test of ability: reading Rosa''s residue under emotional pressure in the
        linen closet'
      - 'Revelation of traitor: Dante deduces someone is planting fake residues within
        the group'
      - Dante proves himself through deduction and insight, gaining Mira's respect
      - 'Addiction/recovery referenced: ''I''m not that guy anymore'' and the OD hallway
        mention'
      gaps:
      - Mira's distrust could be more formidable; she accepts Dante's competence almost
        immediately after one demonstration

      - 'Guilt recognized as obstacle: Dante''s internal conflict about his sister

      gaps:

      satisfied:
      - Direct confrontation with killer (Petra) in Rosa's suite
      - 'Symbolic death: Dante is overwhelmed by flashback of sister''s death; ''The

        and chooses to unlock rather than destroy'

        not through brute force'
      gaps: []
    cross_beat_constraints:
      chekhov_gun:
        score: 1.0
        analysis: "The rusted key introduced in Beat 1 becomes essential in Beat 3\u2014\
          used to unlock the killer's stolen abilities. The date (12-24-17) also functions\
          \ as a crucial clue that recontextualizes the entire conflict."
      character_arc_guilt:
        score: 0.9
        analysis: 'Beat 1: guilt mentioned (''nearly OD''d''). Beat 2: guilt recognized
          as obstacle (sister''s overdose date connection). Beat 3: guilt transformed
          through acceptance (choosing to unlock rather than destroy, seeing sister''s
          ghost as ''a choice''). Arc is clear but could be more explicitly articulated.'
      rising_stakes:
        score: 0.6
        analysis: "Beat 1\u21922: stakes rise (moving from investigation to preparation\
          \ for confrontation). Beat 2\u21923: stakes should escalate dramatically,\
          \ but the sub-basement scene feels like a detour rather than a climactic\
          \ build. The final confrontation arrives abruptly without sufficient tension\
          \ accumulation."
      ally_continuity:
        score: 1.0
        analysis: 'Mira is present and relevant throughout: gains trust in Beat 1,
          plans with Dante in Beat 2, provides crucial reminder (''The date!'') during
          Beat 3 confrontation.'
    context_maintenance:
      protagonist: 0.95
      setting: 0.9
      tone: 0.85
      analysis: Dante's character is well-maintained with his recovery, guilt, and
        artistic abilities central to the narrative. Chicago setting and Buckingham
        Hotel are present but underutilized. Noir tone is strong but occasionally
        shifts toward more fantastical language that dilutes the melancholic grittiness.
    narrative_coherence:
      score: 0.85
      strengths:
      - Clear progression through three beats
      - Emotional through-line connecting sister's death to present conflict
      - Sensory details (violet grief, mercury-like liquid, screaming colors) create
        immersion
      - Twist reveal (Petra as sister's dealer) recontextualizes earlier hints
      weaknesses:
      - Pacing is rushed; 492 words compresses what should be 700-1000 words of development
      - St. Agnes Clinic subplot feels disconnected from main Buckingham Hotel setting
      - Mira's character lacks depth; her motivations beyond 'owing Rosa' are unclear
      - Resolution feels slightly too neat; emotional aftermath is minimal
  overall_assessment: "The story demonstrates strong understanding of the Hero's Journey\
    \ framework and successfully hits most beat requirements. The Chekhov's Gun constraint\
    \ is excellently executed, and character arc progression is clear. However, word\
    \ count deficiency (70% of minimum) severely impacts development depth. The rising\
    \ stakes constraint is the weakest link\u2014Beat 2 to 3 transition lacks sufficient\
    \ tension building. Mira's initial distrust resolves too quickly, and the moment\
    \ of doubt before the ordeal needs more emotional weight. Despite these gaps,\
    \ the core narrative is coherent, the twist is effective, and the thematic exploration\
    \ of guilt and redemption is compelling."
