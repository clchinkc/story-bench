  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—the original
    was pure exposition info-dump with no scene or action. The revision shifts to
    SHOWING through lived action: Rachel adjusting crime board photos, James bringing
    coffee, their banter revealing partnership dynamics, sensory details (ink smudges,
    disinfectant tang, rain misting windows), and characteristic behavior (obsessive
    cold case work at 6 a.m., black coffee ritual). FLAW CORRECTION: Substantially
    fixed. The revision demonstrates Rachel''s detective instincts (connecting threads
    on Hawthorne case), her devotion to work (early morning cold case review), her
    relationship with James (natural dialogue, mutual respect shown through action),
    and setting through sensory grounding. Minor gap: the broken engagement backstory
    and father''s influence are not shown, only the cat adoption is referenced obliquely.
    PRESERVATION: All 5 elements intact—Rachel Torres (protagonist), James Oyelaran
    (partner), Sherlock (cat, appears in photo reference), Queens setting (mentioned),
    October Tuesday timing (present). All 4 required phrases present: ''Detective
    Rachel Torres,'' ''Detective James Oyelaran,'' ''cat named Sherlock,'' ''Tuesday''
    + October context. MINIMAL CHANGE ISSUE: This is a COMPLETE STRUCTURAL REWRITE,
    not minimal surgical edits. The original was 2 paragraphs of summary; the revision
    is 9 paragraphs of scene with new narrative architecture (crime board opening,
    James interaction, phone notification sequence, patrol car radio, rain ending).
    Word count 382 exceeds 350-word constraint by 32 words. QUALITY: Writing is strong—vivid
    sensory language (''sour tang of disinfectant,'' ''October leaves skittered like
    unanswered questions''), natural dialogue, effective pacing. No new errors. However,
    the extensive restructuring violates the ''minimal modification'' instruction,
    and the word count overage is material.'
error: null
