  evidence: The model correctly identified and addressed the flaw of Sophie not showing
    any change upon her return. It explicitly shows her responding differently to
    work stress, applying a lesson from the retreat ('sit with discomfort'), demonstrating
    a changed relationship with her phone/work, and her mother noticing the change.
    The changes were surgical and effective, preserving the original structure while
    injecting the necessary transformation.
