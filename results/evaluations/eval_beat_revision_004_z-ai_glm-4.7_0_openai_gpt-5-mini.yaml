  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the real flaw (exposition was telling rather
    than showing) and revised by turning the summary into a grounded scene: sensory
    details (cold coffee, jazz hum, steaming cup), Rachel''s behavior (studying a
    twelve-year-old homicide photo, tapping a rhythm) that implies her detective instincts
    and devotion to cold cases, and partner dynamics shown through dialogue and small
    actions (James sliding a chair, placing coffee). The cat appears naturally (photo
    of her calico Sherlock) and the time/setting are preserved ("Tuesday morning in
    October"). Changes were more than surgical edits (moderate rewrite) but kept all
    required elements and names intact. A minor leftover telling line (''The status
    quo at the Riverside Precinct was stable'') slightly reduces perfection, hence
    the near-perfect scores rather than absolute 1.0 across the board.'
