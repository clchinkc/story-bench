  failed_items:
  - 'BEAT 1 - Clever problem-solving: Setup described but no actual problem-solving
    shown; crew actions are generic'
  - 'BEAT 1 - Humor and style: Minimal wit or banter; lacks the ''Ocean''s Eleven''
    tone promised'
  - 'BEAT 1 - Things going according to plan: Unclear what the plan actually is or
    how it''s executing'
  - 'BEAT 1 - Unexpected complication (minor): Mentor appearance is major, not minor;
    no other complications introduced'
  - 'BEAT 2 - False victory: No objective achieved; painting never acquired or secured'
  - 'BEAT 2 - Stakes raised dramatically: Mentor reveal is present but lacks new information
    or concrete threat'
  - 'BEAT 2 - Nature of heist changes: Not demonstrated; still framed as simple theft'
  - 'BEAT 2 - Public/party setting intensifies pressure: Setting exists but pressure
    not intensified'
  - 'BEAT 3 - Security closing in: Not shown; no active pursuit or lockdown'
  - 'BEAT 3 - Team friction or trust issues: Absent; crew remains unified and underdeveloped'
  - 'BEAT 3 - Crew member compromised or in danger: Not depicted'
  - 'BEAT 3 - Miri''s choice (painting vs. revenge/saving): No such dilemma presented'
  - 'BEAT 3 - Walls closing in literally/figuratively: Metaphorical only; no concrete
    escalation'
  - 'CHEKHOV''S GUN: No specific detail from Beat 1 becomes critical in Beat 3; security
    system hack mentioned but never payoff'
  - 'TONAL ESCALATION: Tone remains consistently tense/dramatic; lacks playful confidence
    in Beat 1, gallows humor in Beat 3'
  - 'MENTOR PRESENCE: Mentor appears suddenly in Beat 1 as major threat (should be
    background); no escalating presence arc'
  - 'TEAM DYNAMICS: Crew members (Javier, Lena, Marcus) introduced but have no individual
    arcs or plot impact across beats'
  summary: The generated story establishes setting and character effectively but fails
    to structure the three beats as distinct narrative movements. Beat 1 lacks the
    playful heist execution and clever problem-solving that should define 'Fun and
    Games.' Beat 2 never achieves a false victory and doesn't escalate stakes beyond
    the mentor reveal. Beat 3 is entirely absent—no security pursuit, team crisis,
    or moral choice. The mentor's sudden appearance violates the constraint of gradual
    escalation. Crew members are named but never developed. The 444-word count falls
    significantly short of the 700-1000 requirement, preventing full narrative development.
    While context (protagonist, setting, tone) is partially maintained, the story
    reads as a single scene rather than three distinct beats with escalating tension
    and consequences.
