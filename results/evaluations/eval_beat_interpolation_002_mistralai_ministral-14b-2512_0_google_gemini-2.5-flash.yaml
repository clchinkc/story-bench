  evidence: 'All required elements are present: Sarah considers recanting, going to
    authorities, has internal conflict, and is tipped towards a third option (going
    rogue). All ''must not'' items are avoided. The character voice is consistent,
    and the bridge to the next beat is strong, showing her decision to go rogue. Continuity
    is maintained.'
