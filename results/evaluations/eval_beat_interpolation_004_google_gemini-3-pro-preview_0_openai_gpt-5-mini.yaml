  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Thomas directly examines Dr.
    Okonkwo, there is a clear moment where she seems poised to recant (initial lie,
    nod from CEO), Thomas takes decisive, conscience-driven action (leaving podium,
    personal appeal), and the turning point resolves with her admitting the truth.
    No prohibited elements appear (no passive Thomas, no deus ex machina, no simple
    unconflicted confession, no defense victory). Character behavior and courtroom
    continuity are consistent with the setup and the subsequent falling action.'
