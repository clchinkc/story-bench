  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and executed excellently.
    (1) Vulnerability discovery: Alejandro''s hand injury and emotional confession
    about his mother''s death revealed organically through the midnight cooking scene.
    (2) Professional-to-personal shift: Clear progression from employer-employee dynamic
    to intimate collaboration; the ''off hand'' confession marks the turning point.
    (3) Shared connection moment: The arroz con leche preparation and terrace scene
    create genuine emotional bonding through food and memory—thematically resonant.
    (4) Deepened commitment: Maya''s admission ''But that''s not why I''m staying''
    and her choice to cook for ''the man who misses his mother'' represents proactive
    emotional investment beyond contract obligation. MUST-NOT COMPLIANCE: All avoided.
    No premature ''in love'' declarations; relationship remains emotionally intimate
    but not physically consummated. Maya actively chooses to stay and deepen involvement.
    No photograph during scene. Alejandro''s walls genuinely lower through vulnerability.
    CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Both voices authentic—Alejandro''s guarded confession,
    Maya''s gentle wisdom and personal connection to food/family. BRIDGE QUALITY:
    Seamlessly connects BEFORE (contract signing, financial motivation) to AFTER (photograph
    scandal, forced separation). The midnight scene establishes the emotional stakes
    that make the photograph''s violation so devastating. CONTINUITY: Setting (kitchen,
    terrace, sea imagery) consistent with established estate. Timeline logical. Pacing
    supports the beat''s narrative function of moving protagonist from reactive (taking
    job) to proactive (choosing emotional risk). This is professional-quality execution
    of the midpoint beat.'
