  evidence: "BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World\u2014Maya's quiet pottery\
    \ life established; (2) Call to Adventure\u2014dried spring + elder's decree;\
    \ (3) Refusal of Call\u2014explicit hesitation and self-doubt; (4) Meeting the\
    \ Mentor\u2014grandmother's journal as spiritual guide (not a living person, but\
    \ functionally serves this role); (5) Crossing the Threshold\u2014departure from\
    \ village; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies\u2014mountain ascent trials, internal struggle;\
    \ (7) Approach to Inmost Cave\u2014arrival at ruined shrine; (8) The Ordeal\u2014\
    despair at ruins, confrontation with grandmother's legacy; (9) Reward/Seizing\
    \ the Sword\u2014creation of unique vessel, self-discovery; (10) The Road Back\u2014\
    descent with temptation to abandon; (11) Return with Elixir\u2014spring flows,\
    \ village transformed. MISSING: (12) Resurrection\u2014no explicit final test/death-rebirth\
    \ moment before return. The conversion conflates Resurrection with Return. PRESERVATION:\
    \ All 7 elements intact (Maya, pottery, grandmother's legacy, mountain shrine,\
    \ dried spring, surrender theme, transformation). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Strong\
    \ alignment with monomyth structure, though Resurrection beat is underdeveloped\u2014\
    the ceremony functions as both climax and resolution without a distinct penultimate\
    \ crisis. TONE: Meditative and transformative throughout, with quiet introspection\
    \ and spiritual reverence maintained consistently. WORD COUNT ISSUE: 857 words\
    \ exceeds 800-word ceiling by 57 words (7.1% over), a notable but not severe violation."
