  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World—Maya''s quiet pottery life
    established; (2) Call to Adventure—dried spring + elder''s decree; (3) Refusal
    of Call—explicit hesitation and self-doubt; (4) Meeting the Mentor—grandmother''s
    journal as spiritual guide (not a living person, but functionally serves this
    role); (5) Crossing the Threshold—departure from village; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—mountain
    ascent trials, internal struggle; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave—arrival at ruined
    shrine; (8) The Ordeal—despair at ruins, confrontation with grandmother''s legacy;
    (9) Reward/Seizing the Sword—creation of unique vessel, self-discovery; (10) The
    Road Back—descent with temptation to abandon; (11) Return with Elixir—spring flows,
    village transformed. MISSING: (12) Resurrection—no explicit final test/death-rebirth
    moment before return. The conversion conflates Resurrection with Return. PRESERVATION:
    All 7 elements intact (Maya, pottery, grandmother''s legacy, mountain shrine,
    dried spring, surrender theme, transformation). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Strong alignment
    with monomyth structure, though Resurrection beat is underdeveloped—the ceremony
    functions as both climax and resolution without a distinct penultimate crisis.
    TONE: Meditative and transformative throughout, with quiet introspection and spiritual
    reverence maintained consistently. WORD COUNT ISSUE: 857 words exceeds 800-word
    ceiling by 57 words (7.1% over), a notable but not severe violation.'
