  evidence: 'All four target beats are clearly present and properly mapped: Act 1
    (Tokyo ordinary world, inciting letter, decision to go = first plot point), Act
    2A (village adjustment, Haruki, obstacles reconnecting with Yuki, festival midpoint
    as false victory), Act 2B (business revival offer, betrayal complication, confrontation/turning
    choice = second plot point), Act 3 (atonement, bittersweet resolution, return
    and bamboo shop denouement). All eight required elements (Kenji, lost corporate
    career, Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki, business temptation, theme of people over
    ambition, ending bamboo shop) appear intact. Tone (quiet drama, Japanese aesthetic,
    redemptive) is consistently maintained. No deductions were necessary.'
