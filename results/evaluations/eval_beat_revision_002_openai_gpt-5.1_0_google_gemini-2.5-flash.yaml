  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to convey
    a true ''All Is Lost'' moment. It addressed all aspects of the flaw: eliminating
    Marcus''s options (fundraiser canceled, grant rejected), introducing a personal
    loss/betrayal (Denise''s defection, board''s vote), showing Marcus giving up hope,
    and including a ''whiff of death'' (loss of purpose, isolation, wife''s plea).
    The changes were significant enough to fix the flaw but maintained the core structure
    and characters, making them feel like surgical edits rather than a complete rewrite.
    All required phrases and elements were preserved.'
