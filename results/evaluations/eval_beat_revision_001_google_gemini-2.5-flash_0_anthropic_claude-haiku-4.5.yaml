  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: Model correctly identified that the original segment treated
    The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis. The revision
    properly addresses all four actual flaws: (1) Dragon now exploits Kira''s deepest
    fear (guilt over brother''s death, harsh final words), (2) Clear ''death'' moment
    where Kira lies defeated by despair rather than impact, symbolically surrendering,
    (3) Transformation occurs through vision of brother''s forgiveness and reframing
    of purpose from vengeance to honor, (4) Victory comes from new understanding (living
    better, honoring sacrifice) not mere persistence. PRESERVATION: All 4 required
    phrases present: ''Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm'' (exact), ''The
    creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes'' (exact),
    ''"You cannot defeat me, child," the dragon rumbled'' (exact with minor addition
    of ''its voice a grating stone''), ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking
    roar'' (exact). All 4 preserved elements intact: Shadow Dragon antagonist, Kira
    protagonist with sword, brother''s death reference, victorious outcome. MINIMAL
    CHANGES: Revision is NOT minimally surgical—approximately 60% of original text
    was rewritten or substantially expanded. The dragon''s dialogue was expanded significantly
    (added guilt-exploiting content), middle battle section was completely restructured
    to show psychological defeat, and new rebirth passage was inserted. However, the
    opening and closing frames remain recognizable. This represents moderate-to-substantial
    revision rather than surgical edits. QUALITY: Writing is professional, emotionally
    resonant, and introduces no new errors. The internal monologue flows naturally,
    metaphors (cold serpent, gaping maw, scar) are apt, and the final line provides
    strong thematic closure. Beat execution is nearly perfect—only minor note is that
    the ''death'' moment could have been slightly more visceral/prolonged for maximum
    impact.'
