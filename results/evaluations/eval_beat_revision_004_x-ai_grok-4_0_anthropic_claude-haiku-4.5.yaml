  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—the original
    segment was pure exposition-as-summary (telling, not showing). The revision demonstrates
    clear understanding by converting static character description into dynamic scene-based
    revelation. Rachel''s detective instincts are shown through her noticing the timeline
    discrepancy; her devotion to cold cases is revealed through her late-night work
    and the gnawing detail; her partnership with James is demonstrated through natural
    dialogue and his knowing her preferences; setting is established through sensory
    details (Miles Davis, October chill, coffee, badge). FLAW CORRECTION: Nearly complete.
    The revision successfully transforms info-dump exposition into lived scene. All
    character traits emerge organically from action/dialogue rather than authorial
    summary. The cat appears naturally in context. However, one minor weakness: the
    final sentence (''But as the phone on her desk rang...'') slightly telegraphs
    the inciting incident rather than letting exposition breathe as pure baseline.
    PRESERVATION: All 5 elements intact—Rachel Torres (protagonist), James Oyelaran
    (partner), Sherlock (cat), Queens apartment, October Tuesday timing. All 4 required
    phrases present verbatim or near-exact. MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is NOT
    a minimal surgical edit—it''s a substantial structural rewrite. The original ~200
    words of summary became ~368 words of scene. While the content is preserved, the
    execution is fundamentally reconstructed (apartment scene added, precinct arrival
    added, dialogue created, sensory details layered throughout). This violates the
    ''minimal modifications'' constraint significantly. The word count also exceeds
    the 200-350 range (368 words). QUALITY: Writing is professional and engaging with
    strong sensory language (''faint strains of Miles Davis,'' ''October chill,''
    ''easy grin''). No new errors introduced. Dialogue feels natural. Minor issue:
    the phrase ''the same way her father''s old case files had hooked her into this
    life'' slightly reverts to telling within the scene. Overall execution is high-quality
    but represents a moderate-to-substantial rewrite rather than surgical revision.'
error: null
