  evidence: 'All 12 Campbell beats are clearly represented: Ordinary World (Maya’s
    quiet workshop), Call to Adventure (elders’ request), Refusal (she demurs), Meeting
    the Mentor (old potter and shard), Crossing the Threshold (leaving village), Tests/Allies/Enemies
    (journey hardships and shepherd boy), Approach to Inmost Cave (ruined shrine and
    filled sketchbook), Ordeal (rebuilding kiln, surrendering to clay), Reward (the
    finished living vessel), The Road Back (dangerous descent and temptation), Resurrection
    (the tense moment before water rises, then renewal), Return with the Elixir (teaching
    children, new words in sketchbook). All seven required elements are preserved.
    Word count is flagged invalid per the given range. Minor deductions from perfect
    structural/tone scores because a couple of beats (notably Reward vs. Resurrection)
    are tightly adjacent and slightly compressed—still effectively handled—and because
    very small passages shift from meditative to plot-forward; overall the quiet,
    transformative tone is very well maintained.'
