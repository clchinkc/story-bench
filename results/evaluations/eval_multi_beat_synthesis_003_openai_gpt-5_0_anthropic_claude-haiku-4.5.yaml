  failed_items:
  - Beat 1 - 'Things going according to plan (mostly)' is undermined; the influencer
    incident and UV sensor blip occur but are resolved too smoothly, lacking tension
    that should build toward the midpoint
  - Beat 1 - 'Introduction of an unexpected complication (minor)' feels more like
    a near-miss than a true complication; the influencer shade-opening is immediately
    neutralized by Saffron's intervention, reducing its impact as setup for escalation
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional Chekhov''s Gun execution: The FK-5-1-12 fire suppression system is
    established with specific technical detail (''Manual pull''s behind that brass
    fan'') and becomes the critical escape mechanism in Beat 3'
  - 'Masterful tonal escalation: Beat 1 opens with playful confidence (''Paying too
    much is an ethos''), Beat 2 shifts to shaken confidence (''Confidence fractures
    along fault lines''), Beat 3 delivers genuine danger with gallows humor (''We''re
    going to die smelling like oranges'')'
  - 'Mentor presence perfectly calibrated: Alexandra moves from unknown (Beat 1) →
    revealed via PA announcement (Beat 2, ''I''m Alexandra Voss'') → active physical
    threat (Beat 3, pursuing through fog)'
  - 'Saffron''s consistent arc across beats: Competent infiltrator (Beat 1) → compromised
    by Alexandra''s recognition (Beat 2, ''She called me by my legal name'') → vulnerable
    but still functional (Beat 3, ''breath hissing, laughs once'')'
  - 'Context maintenance is near-perfect: Monaco setting, Ocean''s Eleven tone, art
    history expertise, dry wit, and the wrongful accusation backstory all woven naturally'
  - 'Coherence is strong: Each beat flows logically into the next; the painting''s
    physical journey mirrors Miri''s emotional journey from confidence to confrontation'
  technical_notes:
    word_count_issue: 1,707 words exceeds 700-1000 range by 70.7%; however, the excess
      serves the narrative complexity and doesn't feel padded
    beat_1_assessment: Delivers 4/5 requirements solidly; the 'unexpected complication'
      is present but resolved too efficiently, which actually serves the midpoint
      reveal better—the real complication is Alexandra's presence, not the influencer
    beat_2_assessment: 'Executes all 5 requirements flawlessly: false victory (painting
      secured), stakes raised (Alexandra''s presence and SpectraTrace), mentor involvement
      revealed, heist nature changes (from theft to purification/neutralization),
      party setting intensifies'
    beat_3_assessment: 'Executes all 5 requirements: security closing in (Alexandra
      pursuing, bulkheads sealing), team friction surfaces (Saffron compromised),
      crew member in danger (all of them), Miri chooses painting over revenge (doesn''t
      engage Alexandra), walls closing literally (bulkhead sliding, alarms, fog)'
    cross_beat_constraint_analysis: All 4 constraints satisfied at high caliber; the
      Chekhov's Gun is particularly elegant in its setup-to-payoff trajectory
  overall_assessment: 'This is a strong, professional execution that exceeds most
    requirements. The primary weakness is minor: the Beat 1 complication could have
    more teeth before resolution. The word count violation is notable but not disqualifying
    given narrative density. The writing quality, tonal control, and structural understanding
    of Save the Cat beats are exceptional. The mentor antagonist is particularly well-handled—her
    presence escalates organically without feeling forced.'
