  evidence: 'The model correctly identified the All Is Lost deficiency and fixed it
    by removing remaining options and support: the fundraiser fails, the grant is
    denied, Denise quits/leaves the scene, and Marcus''s wife takes the kids — producing
    isolation, a ''whiff of death'' (loss of family/identity tied to the center),
    and Marcus''s verbal surrender (''It''s over''). All four required elements and
    the four exact/near-exact required phrases are preserved. Changes are more than
    purely surgical (added scenes, details, and dialogue to create hopelessness),
    so minimal_change_score is moderate (0.60). Overall writing is strong with no
    major errors, hence a high quality_score (0.90).'
