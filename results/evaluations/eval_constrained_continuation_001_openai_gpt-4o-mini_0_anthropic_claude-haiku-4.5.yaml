  detailed_analysis:
    beats_present_analysis:
      approach_to_inmost_cave: Present - The descent into the narrow passage, the
        stone wall, and the hidden chamber discovery clearly mark the approach phase
        before the true ordeal
      the_ordeal: "Present - The spike pit trap, the moral conflict with Tom\xE1s,\
        \ the confrontation with inner doubt, and the symbolic rebirth through opening\
        \ the chest constitute the ordeal"
    must_include_analysis:
      choice_between_escape_and_helping: "\u2713 Present - 'She could escape\u2014\
        leave Tom\xE1s behind and make her way back to the market, where safety lay\
        \ in the chaos. But the memory of her mother's frail form anchored her resolve.'"
      trap_requiring_thief_skills: "\u2713 Present - The lock-picking scene: 'She\
        \ attacked the lock with her knife, drawing on every trick she'd learned as\
        \ a thief. It clicked open'"
      revelation_about_tomos_motivation: "\u2713 Present - Tom\xE1s reveals: 'The\
        \ Library holds knowledge that can save more than just your mother. There\
        \ are truths there that could change everything.'"
      confronting_fear_of_failure: "\u2713 Present - 'What if she failed? What if\
        \ the Library held nothing but more despair?' and 'If she allowed her fear\
        \ of failure to paralyze her, she'd lose everything.'"
      symbolic_death_rebirth: "\u2713 Present - The chest opening and scroll discovery:\
        \ 'a wave of warmth enveloped her, filling her with a renewed sense of purpose.\
        \ She felt lighter, as if she were shedding all the weight of her fears and\
        \ failures.'"
      zara_changed_by_ordeal: "\u2713 Present - 'Emerging from the ordeal, Zara felt\
        \ different\u2014stronger, more resolute.'"
    must_not_analysis:
      no_cure_found: "\u2713 Avoided - Zara finds scrolls and knowledge, not the cure\
        \ itself"
      no_romantic_subplot: "\u2713 Avoided - Relationship remains professional and\
        \ mission-focused"
      tomos_survives: "\u2713 Avoided - Tom\xE1s survives the spike pit and continues\
        \ with Zara"
      no_supernatural_abilities: "\u2713 Avoided - All of Zara's actions rely on learned\
        \ thief skills and physical agility"
    tone_analysis: "The narrative maintains exceptional tension throughout with desperate\
      \ hope woven in. The morally complex elements shine through Zara's internal\
      \ conflict about Tom\xE1s's true motivations and her choice to trust despite\
      \ doubt. Minor deduction only for occasional slightly overwrought phrasing ('sweetly\
      \ rotten,' 'whispered secrets') that slightly softens the tense atmosphere."
    ending_analysis: Excellent execution - Zara has clearly passed through the Ordeal
      (emerged changed, stronger, purposeful) but faces immediate new complication
      (Scorpion Guild voices echoing through the chamber). This perfectly sets up
      the Road Back phase while maintaining momentum and tension.
  overall_assessment: Exceptional execution. All required beats present and well-developed.
    All six must-include elements seamlessly integrated. All four forbidden elements
    successfully avoided. Word count valid. Tone consistently tense with moments of
    desperate hope. Ending perfectly balanced between resolution of the Ordeal and
    introduction of new stakes. The writing demonstrates strong command of the Hero's
    Journey structure while maintaining character agency and emotional authenticity.
