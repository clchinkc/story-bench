  evidence: "The revision clearly targeted the actual flaw (exposition told rather\
    \ than shown) by converting summary into a lived scene: the cold-case board, Rachel\
    \ adding a note, her exchange with Detective James Oyelaran, the precinct coffee,\
    \ and the Queens apartment with Sherlock and jazz\u2014all concrete actions and\
    \ sensory details that reveal character, relationship, and devotion to work. All\
    \ five required story elements (Rachel as protagonist detective, James, Sherlock,\
    \ Queens apartment, Tuesday in October) were preserved. Of the four required preserved\
    \ phrases, three are present or near-present: 'Detective James Oyelaran' and 'On\
    \ a Tuesday morning in October' appear exactly; the cat/sherlock is shown though\
    \ not as the exact phrase 'cat named Sherlock'; 'Detective Rachel Torres' is not\
    \ rendered with the 'Detective' title (only 'Rachel Torres'). Changes were moderate\
    \ rather than purely surgical\u2014the piece is substantially rephrased to show\
    \ rather than tell\u2014so minimal_change_score is 0.5. Writing quality is strong\
    \ with a minor bit of residual telling ('with the certainty of twelve years on\
    \ the job'), hence quality_score 0.9."
