  evidence: 'The revision clearly targeted the All Is Lost problem: it removes remaining
    options (fundraiser failed, grant denied, board resigned/freezing accounts), strips
    support (Denise leaves, wife withdraws savings and abandons him), adds a palpable
    ''whiff of death'' (the dream called a corpse, eviction notice dropping) and shows
    Marcus utterly defeated and isolated. All four required elements (Marcus protagonist,
    community center/youth program, eviction crisis, Denise present) and all four
    required phrases are preserved verbatim. Changes were more than surgical—new paragraphs
    and details were added to close off options and deepen despair—so minimal_change_score
    is moderate (0.5), though the preservation and beat execution are strong.'
