  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—the original
    segment was pure exposition-as-info-dump (telling, not showing). The revision
    transforms this into a lived scene that reveals character through action and behavior.
    FLAW CORRECTION: Fully addressed. The revision: (1) Shows Rachel''s detective
    instincts through her obsessive focus on a cold case file and her ability to read
    crime scene details; (2) Demonstrates her relationship with James through natural
    dialogue, comfortable silence, and their ''silent language'' built on partnership;
    (3) Reveals her devotion to work through her Tuesday morning cold case obsession;
    (4) Grounds the scene in sensory detail (bitter coffee, manila folder, jazz station,
    homicide photo); (5) Naturally incorporates Sherlock through a phone background
    reference tied to her rescue work. PRESERVATION: All 5 required elements present:
    Detective Rachel Torres (exact), Detective James Oyelaran (exact), cat named Sherlock
    (exact), Tuesday morning in October (exact), Queens apartment (referenced). All
    4 required phrases present verbatim. MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: This is NOT a
    minimal surgical edit—it''s a substantial structural rewrite. The original 2-paragraph
    info-dump (248 words of summary) is replaced with a 3-paragraph scene (248 words
    of action/dialogue). However, this level of restructuring was necessary to fix
    the fundamental flaw (telling→showing). The constraint to preserve elements was
    met, but the constraint to make ''minimal modifications'' was violated. The model
    chose correctness over minimalism, which is defensible given the severity of the
    original flaw. QUALITY: Writing is professional, dialogue feels natural, sensory
    details are vivid and purposeful (cold coffee, jazz, homicide photo), and no new
    errors introduced. The pacing and beat execution are strong.'
