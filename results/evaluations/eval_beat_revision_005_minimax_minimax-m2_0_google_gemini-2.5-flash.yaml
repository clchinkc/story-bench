  evidence: 'The segment effectively executes the "Dark Night of the Soul" beat. It
    follows the gallery closure (All Is Lost moment), shows Maya alone and isolated
    in darkness, captures genuine despair through her self-blame and failed promises,
    offers no solutions yet, and includes mortality reflections through her mother''s
    death. The emotional progression from loss to reflection to acceptance of defeat
    feels authentic and appropriately internal.


    **NO REVISION NEEDED**'
