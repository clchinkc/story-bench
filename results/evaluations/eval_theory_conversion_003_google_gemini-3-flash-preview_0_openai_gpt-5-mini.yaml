  evidence: 'All 4 target acts are present: Act 1 (office, inciting letter, Kenji
    boards Shinkansen as first plot point), Act 2A (village life, Haruki, festival
    midpoint/false victory), Act 2B (rivals'' deal, misunderstanding, dark night decision),
    Act 3 (wedding climax, reconciliation, denouement with bamboo shop). All 8 required
    elements are preserved (Kenji, lost career, Yuki, Kyoto wedding, Haruki, business
    temptation, theme of people over ambition, bamboo shop ending). Minor deductions:
    structural_accuracy_score reduced slightly because the second plot point / Break
    into Three is handled well but a touch compressed (the decline of the deal and
    the dark night are close together, blurring the transition that could be more
    distinct). Tone_score reduced slightly because a few modern/boardroom phrasings
    interrupt the otherwise quiet, Japanese-aesthetic redemptive tone. Word count
    is invalid per criteria: the conversion is 811 words, exceeding the 550–750 range.'
