  evidence: The conversion successfully maps all three acts of the original into Freytag's
    five stages. Exposition clearly sets up Samira's world and the initial discovery.
    Rising Action details the escalating crisis and the Nexus Biotech reveal. The
    Climax is well-defined by the confrontation with Nexus and Samira's data dump.
    Falling Action covers the press conference and immediate aftermath. Denouement
    provides a clear resolution for Samira's personal journey. All six core elements
    are preserved, and the medical thriller tone with ethical weight is consistently
    maintained throughout the narrative. The word count is within the valid range.
