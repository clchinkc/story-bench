  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation
    and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.
    The revision fixes this precisely by: (1) inserting a moment of internal conflict
    where Sophie recognizes the pull of old habits, (2) explicitly referencing the
    retreat''s lesson (''quiet power of letting go, breathing through chaos''), (3)
    demonstrating changed behavior through action (setting phone down, choosing not
    to call Linda), (4) providing clear contrast via mother''s surprised reaction
    (''That''s new''), and (5) showing integration through Sophie''s reframed perspective
    on her apartment and future (''canvas she could repaint''). All 4 required phrases
    preserved exactly: ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare'', ''How was Thailand?
    her mother asked'', ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'', ''It''s good to
    be home, she said''. Changes were surgical: the original problematic section (scrolling
    emails, typing response, ''You know how it is'') was replaced with a brief internal
    struggle and resolution, adding ~80 words while maintaining structure. No new
    errors introduced. The beat now fully satisfies Story Circle requirements by showing
    genuine transformation integrated into behavior, not just a trip taken.'
