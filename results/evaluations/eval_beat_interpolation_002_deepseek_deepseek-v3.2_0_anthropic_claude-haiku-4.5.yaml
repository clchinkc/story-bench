  evidence: "STRENGTHS: Excellent internal conflict execution\u2014Sarah weighs recanting\
    \ (seductive poison metaphor), considers official channels through Webb conversation,\
    \ and experiences genuine debate between duty and sister's safety. Strong character\
    \ voice with visceral details (trembling hands, shadows under eyes). Good bridge\
    \ to Break Into Two with resignation decision. WEAKNESSES: Word count violation\
    \ (409 vs 250-400 max). Missing one required element: no clear moment showing\
    \ Sarah's duty to justice/testimony\u2014the debate focuses heavily on sister\
    \ vs. system but underexplores her professional oath conflict. VIOLATIONS: (1)\
    \ Sarah's decision to go rogue is somewhat premature\u2014the AFTER section shows\
    \ her already resigned and planning vigilante action, which technically skips\
    \ the full debate and jumps to commitment. The beat should end with decision clarity\
    \ but not execution. (2) The resignation happens in the AFTER section but is foreshadowed\
    \ too heavily in the generated beat, blurring the boundary. POSITIVE: Webb's earnest\
    \ advice provides external perspective that tips her decision, satisfying the\
    \ 'conversation that tips her' requirement. Character consistency is strong\u2014\
    her analytical mind and protective instinct align throughout. Continuity maintained\
    \ between sections despite the boundary issue."
