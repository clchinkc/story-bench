  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and excellently executed:
    (1) Maya discovers Alejandro''s vulnerability through his abuela memory and forced
    retirement trauma; (2) relationship shifts from professional (contract-focused)
    to personal (cooking for him, not the paycheck); (3) shared midnight kitchen moment
    creates genuine connection through sensory detail and emotional openness; (4)
    Maya makes explicit commitment choice (''She would stay. Not just to survive six
    months, but to try and fill some of that quiet emptiness''). The beat perfectly
    executes Act 2 Midpoint function—raises emotional stakes, shifts Maya from reactive
    (earning salary) to proactive (choosing to help him heal), creates irreversible
    commitment. All must-not items avoided: no premature love declaration, no intimacy
    beyond forehead touch, no photograph during scene, Alejandro''s walls clearly
    lowered. Character voices consistent—Alejandro''s vulnerability authentic to his
    trauma, Maya''s compassion grounded in her own family values. Bridge seamless:
    connects contract signing to photograph scandal. Continuity perfect: kitchen setting,
    timeline, character states all align. ONLY DEDUCTION: Word count 474 exceeds 450-word
    maximum by 24 words (5.3% over). This is a minor technical violation that doesn''t
    affect narrative quality.'
