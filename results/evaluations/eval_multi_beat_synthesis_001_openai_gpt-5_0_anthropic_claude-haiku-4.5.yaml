      satisfied:
      - Dante encounters Lena who distrusts him initially ('Maybe the guy who shows
        up after disappearing for months')
      - 'Test of ability under pressure: navigating the emotional trap/web in the
        ballroom'
      - 'Revelation of traitor: Dori Kole identified as quartermaster selling out
        Resonants'
      - Dante proves himself by safely guiding Lena through the emotional trap, earning
        her trust
      - 'Addiction/recovery referenced throughout: sober coin, three years clean,
        old hunger, pressure as substitute for substance use'
      notes: All five requirements clearly met with strong integration
    beat_2_approach_to_inmost_cave:
      score: 0.95
      satisfied:
      - 'Planning scene: Lena unfolds map, discusses cistern strategy, explains the
        siphon hook'
      - 'Dante recognizes confrontation requires facing guilt about Ana: ''He''s hunting
        what we can''t face. He''ll use her.'''
      - 'Preparation: gathering tools (chalk, rope, bolt cutters, tuning fork), establishing
        ritual'
      - 'Moment of doubt: ''If I see her, I might not come back'' - explicit fear
        before proceeding'
      - 'Symbolic threshold: chalk line at the cavern entrance, descent through laundry
        chute and iron stairs'
      notes: All five requirements present; threshold is particularly well-executed
    beat_3_the_ordeal:
      score: 0.9
      satisfied:
      - 'Direct confrontation: killer emerges, deploys siphon device, attacks with
        emotional weapon'
      - 'Symbolic death: Dante overwhelmed by siphon, pulled into flood of grief,
        unable to breathe, loses coin'
      - 'All seems lost: ''He couldn''t tell where he ended and the flood began,''
        paralyzed by guilt'
      - 'Transformation through acceptance: Dante accepts his inability to save Ana
        while affirming love and survival (''I left you... And I''m still here...
        And I love you'')'
      - 'Victory through understanding: Dante strikes tuning fork with coin, rebalances
        emotional field, killer flees rather than being defeated through force'
      notes: Exceptionally strong execution; transformation is earned and emotionally
        resonant
    chekhov_gun:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      analysis: "The sober coin introduced in Beat 1 as character detail becomes essential\
        \ in Beat 3. Dante loses it during the ordeal, crawls to retrieve it, and\
        \ uses it to strike the tuning fork\u2014creating the note that breaks the\
        \ killer's siphon. The coin's symbolic weight (recovery, showing up, courage)\
        \ directly enables the resolution."
    character_arc_progression:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      analysis: 'Beat 1: Guilt mentioned (''earned doubt,'' carrying Ana''s death).
        Beat 2: Guilt recognized as obstacle (''He''s hunting what we can''t face'').
        Beat 3: Guilt transformed through acceptance (''I left you... And I''m still
        here... And I love you''). Arc is complete and organic.'
    rising_stakes:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      analysis: 'Beat 1: Personal danger, proving oneself. Beat 2: Preparing to confront
        a serial killer, recognizing emotional vulnerability. Beat 3: Direct confrontation
        where Dante nearly drowns in his own guilt, killer has supernatural weapon,
        Rosa''s death is weaponized. Stakes escalate clearly.'
    ally_continuity:
      score: 1.0
      satisfied: true
      analysis: 'Lena present and essential throughout: Beat 1 (initial meeting, trust-building),
        Beat 2 (planning, providing tools and strategy), Beat 3 (descends with Dante,
        attempts to help during confrontation, pulls him back from drowning). Her
        presence is consistent and meaningful.'
    context_maintenance:
      score: 0.95
      analysis: "Protagonist: Dante's voice, abilities, and recovery arc maintained\
        \ throughout. Setting: Buckingham Hotel's emotional residue vividly rendered;\
        \ underworld of Resonants established. Tone: Noir-tinged, melancholic, determined\u2014\
        consistent. Minor: Could have slightly more Chicago specificity, but setting\
        \ is clear."
    coherence:
      score: 0.92
      analysis: "Narrative flows logically from discovery to planning to confrontation.\
        \ Emotional logic is strong. Minor issue: killer's motivation ('I know the\
        \ first color you ever refused to see') is intriguing but slightly underdeveloped\u2014\
        feels like it could use one more line of explanation. Otherwise, beats connect\
        \ seamlessly."
    overall_assessment:
      strengths:
      - Exceptional execution of all three beats with sophisticated emotional depth
      - Chekhov's Gun perfectly integrated (coin as both character detail and plot
        device)
      - Character arc is earned and transformative, not imposed
      - Ally relationship feels genuine and develops naturally
      - 'Prose quality is strong: sensory, metaphor-rich, noir-appropriate'
      - Stakes escalate meaningfully across beats
      - Symbolic elements (tuning fork, coin, chalk line, colors) work thematically
      weaknesses:
      - Word count significantly exceeds limit (2017 vs 1000 max) - approximately
        2x over
      - Killer's characterization could be slightly sharper (motivation hinted but
        not fully crystallized)
      - Could benefit from one more beat of Lena's perspective to deepen ally bond
      calibration_notes: "This is high-quality work that satisfies all structural\
        \ requirements and constraints. The word count violation is the primary issue\u2014\
        the story would need substantial trimming (approximately 50% reduction) to\
        \ meet specifications. However, the narrative quality, character work, and\
        \ thematic coherence are professional-grade. If word count were within range,\
        \ this would score 0.9+. As submitted, the overage prevents a higher overall\
        \ score despite excellent content."
  final_score: 0.82
  score_justification: 'Excellent beat execution (0.93), perfect cross-beat constraint
    satisfaction (1.0), strong context maintenance (0.95), and good coherence (0.92)
    are significantly undermined by word count violation (2017 vs 1000 max = 101%
    over limit). The content quality is exceptional, but the structural requirement
    failure is material. Score reflects: (0.93 + 1.0 + 0.95 + 0.92) / 4 = 0.95 content
    quality, reduced by ~0.13 for word count violation, yielding 0.82.'
