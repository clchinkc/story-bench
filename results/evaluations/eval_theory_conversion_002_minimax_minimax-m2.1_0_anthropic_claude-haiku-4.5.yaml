  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World - Maya''s quiet pottery life;
    (2) Call to Adventure - dried spring, elders'' announcement; (3) Refusal of Call
    - ''almost didn''t go,'' self-doubt; (4) Meeting the Mentor - grandmother''s journal
    discovered; (5) Crossing Threshold - leaves village without looking back; (6)
    Tests/Allies/Enemies - mountain tests her, steep trails, thin air; (7) Approach
    to Inmost Cave - reaching the shrine ruins; (8) Ordeal - solitary work with clay,
    surrendering control; (9) Reward - creates the vessel, understands her purpose;
    (10) Road Back - difficult return journey, temptation to abandon vessel; (11)
    Resurrection - performs ceremony, water returns, proves transformation. MISSING:
    (12) Return with Elixir is partially present but underdeveloped—the final paragraph
    hints at teaching students but doesn''t fully crystallize the tangible gift/knowledge
    she brings back to transform the community systematically. PRESERVATION: All 7
    elements intact—Maya (protagonist), pottery/ceramics (central), grandmother''s
    legacy (journal, techniques), mountain shrine (three-day journey), dried spring
    (catalyst), surrender theme (''let the clay speak''), transformation (explicit).
    STRUCTURE: Follows monomyth well but compresses some beats; the Mentor stage is
    brief (journal only, no living guide). TONE: Consistently meditative, quiet, introspective—excellent
    use of internal reflection, dream imagery, and lyrical language (''Some inheritances
    are too heavy to carry''). Word count: 707 words (valid).'
