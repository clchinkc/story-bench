  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive
    reasoning. The model accurately recognized all five key requirements were satisfied:
    (1) follows major defeat (gallery closure), (2) protagonist isolated (dark apartment,
    unanswered calls), (3) genuine despair and reflection (sitting on floor, tears,
    failed promises), (4) no solutions presented (pure wallowing), and (5) mortality/whiff
    of death elements (mother''s death, hospice memory). The model demonstrated strong
    beat understanding by explaining how the quiet, internal tone and vulnerability
    align with Dark Night of the Soul requirements. No unnecessary changes were suggested
    or made. The explanation was detailed, accurate, and directly addressed why the
    segment works well for this beat.'
