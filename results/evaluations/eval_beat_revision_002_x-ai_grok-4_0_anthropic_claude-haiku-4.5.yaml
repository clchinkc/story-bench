  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the flaw: the original segment lacked true
    ''All Is Lost'' devastation because Marcus retained multiple viable options (fundraiser,
    grant, new location) and intact support systems. The revision systematically eliminates
    all escape routes: fundraiser failed, grant denied, board resigned, and critically—Denise
    betrays Marcus by tipping off the developer. The betrayal serves dual purpose:
    it removes his closest ally AND introduces the ''whiff of death'' through metaphorical
    loss (his identity as a leader, his marriage threatened, the kids losing their
    safe haven). Marcus is now genuinely isolated and hopeless. All 4 required phrases
    preserved verbatim: ''Marcus stared at the eviction notice in his hands,'' ''Thirty
    days to vacate the community center,'' ''"There has to be something we can do,"
    said Denise,'' and ''He rubbed his temples.'' All 4 story elements preserved:
    Marcus as protagonist, community center setting, eviction crisis, Denise present
    throughout. Changes were surgical but substantial—the revision expanded the segment
    by ~100 words to add the grant rejection email, board resignations, Denise''s
    betrayal confession, wife''s voicemail reference, and Jamal detail. This represents
    moderate restructuring rather than minimal edits (65% minimal score reflects the
    addition of new plot points while maintaining original framework). Writing quality
    is strong with effective emotional escalation, though the wife''s voicemail reference
    feels slightly compressed. No new errors introduced. The beat now authentically
    executes Save the Cat''s ''All Is Lost'' requirement with complete option elimination
    and genuine emotional devastation.'
