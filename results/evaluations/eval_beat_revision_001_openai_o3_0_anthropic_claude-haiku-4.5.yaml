  evidence: "DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the actual flaw\u2014that the\
    \ original segment treated The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative\
    \ crisis. The revision explicitly addresses all four required components: (1)\
    \ Dragon exploits Kira's deepest fear by invoking her brother's death and her\
    \ guilt over abandoning him; (2) Clear 'death' moment when Kira dangles over the\
    \ abyss and 'let go inside, surrendering to the dark'; (3) Transformation occurs\
    \ through acceptance\u2014'In that surrender, something shifted'\u2014where she\
    \ reframes her brother's lesson from erasure to resilience; (4) Victory flows\
    \ from new understanding ('as if revealed only by this new clarity') rather than\
    \ mere persistence. PRESERVATION: All 4 required phrases present: 'Kira faced\
    \ the Shadow Dragon across the chasm' (opening), 'The creature was massive\u2014\
    twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes' (intact), 'You cannot defeat\
    \ me, child,' the dragon rumbled' (preserved with expansion), 'The Shadow Dragon\
    \ collapsed with a earth-shaking roar' (ending). All 4 preserved elements maintained:\
    \ Shadow Dragon antagonist, Kira protagonist with sword, brother's death reference,\
    \ victorious outcome. Setting (chasm) unchanged. MINIMAL CHANGES: The revision\
    \ is NOT minimally surgical\u2014it's a moderate-to-substantial expansion (331\
    \ words vs ~180 original). However, this expansion is justified and necessary:\
    \ the original was incomplete/truncated ('pi' ending), and adding psychological\
    \ depth to The Ordeal requires narrative space. The model added internal monologue,\
    \ guilt exploration, the surrender moment, and transformation insight\u2014all\
    \ essential to fixing the flaw. The core battle structure remains recognizable\
    \ (three knockdowns, opening revealed, final strike). QUALITY: Writing is professional,\
    \ emotionally resonant, and introduces no new errors. The metaphorical language\
    \ ('small death,' 'birth-shout,' 'fire she would carry home') elevates the prose.\
    \ The guilt-as-dragon-weapon is thematically coherent. Minor: 'earth-shaking'\
    \ should arguably be 'earth-shaking' (already correct). BEAT SATISFACTION: Executes\
    \ Campbell's Ordeal definition nearly perfectly\u2014only minor gap is that the\
    \ transformation could be slightly more explicit about what new ability/understanding\
    \ Kira gains beyond emotional acceptance (though this is a minor quibble). The\
    \ symbolic death and rebirth are clear and earned."
