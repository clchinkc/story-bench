  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the actual flaw—that the original
    segment treated The Ordeal as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis.
    The revision explicitly addresses all four required components: (1) Dragon exploits
    Kira''s deepest fear by invoking her brother''s death and her guilt over abandoning
    him; (2) Clear ''death'' moment when Kira dangles over the abyss and ''let go
    inside, surrendering to the dark''; (3) Transformation occurs through acceptance—''In
    that surrender, something shifted''—where she reframes her brother''s lesson from
    erasure to resilience; (4) Victory flows from new understanding (''as if revealed
    only by this new clarity'') rather than mere persistence. PRESERVATION: All 4
    required phrases present: ''Kira faced the Shadow Dragon across the chasm'' (opening),
    ''The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian scales and burning eyes'' (intact),
    ''You cannot defeat me, child,'' the dragon rumbled'' (preserved with expansion),
    ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed with a earth-shaking roar'' (ending). All 4 preserved
    elements maintained: Shadow Dragon antagonist, Kira protagonist with sword, brother''s
    death reference, victorious outcome. Setting (chasm) unchanged. MINIMAL CHANGES:
    The revision is NOT minimally surgical—it''s a moderate-to-substantial expansion
    (331 words vs ~180 original). However, this expansion is justified and necessary:
    the original was incomplete/truncated (''pi'' ending), and adding psychological
    depth to The Ordeal requires narrative space. The model added internal monologue,
    guilt exploration, the surrender moment, and transformation insight—all essential
    to fixing the flaw. The core battle structure remains recognizable (three knockdowns,
    opening revealed, final strike). QUALITY: Writing is professional, emotionally
    resonant, and introduces no new errors. The metaphorical language (''small death,''
    ''birth-shout,'' ''fire she would carry home'') elevates the prose. The guilt-as-dragon-weapon
    is thematically coherent. Minor: ''earth-shaking'' should arguably be ''earth-shaking''
    (already correct). BEAT SATISFACTION: Executes Campbell''s Ordeal definition nearly
    perfectly—only minor gap is that the transformation could be slightly more explicit
    about what new ability/understanding Kira gains beyond emotional acceptance (though
    this is a minor quibble). The symbolic death and rebirth are clear and earned.'
