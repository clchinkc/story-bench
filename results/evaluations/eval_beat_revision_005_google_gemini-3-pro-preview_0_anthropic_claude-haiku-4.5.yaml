  evidence: 'The model completely failed the primary task. It was presented with an
    ORIGINAL SEGMENT that was correctly executed and needed NO revision. Instead of
    recognizing this and stating ''NO REVISION NEEDED'', the model provided a REWRITTEN
    VERSION of the segment. This is a false positive - an unnecessary revision of
    already well-executed material. The model rewrote the passage, adding phrases
    like ''It was a complete, humiliating dismantling of her life''s work,'' ''her
    voice already half-ghost,'' ''like dirt being shoveled onto a coffin,'' and ''the
    paralysis of failure swallow her whole.'' While the rewrite demonstrates good
    understanding of the Dark Night of the Soul beat (0.8 score for beat understanding
    - it shows comprehension of despair, isolation, reflection, and mortality elements),
    it fundamentally misses the instruction: this segment was CORRECTLY EXECUTED and
    should not have been revised. The model over-diagnosed and over-corrected, treating
    a well-crafted passage as if it needed improvement when it did not.'
