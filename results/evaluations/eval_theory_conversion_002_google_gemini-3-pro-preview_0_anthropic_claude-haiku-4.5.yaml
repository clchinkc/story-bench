  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World—Maya''s studio, simple pottery,
    safe life; (2) Call to Adventure—Elder arrives with request about master''s vessel;
    (3) Refusal of Call—Maya explicitly refuses, retreats behind wheel; (4) Meeting
    the Mentor—Grandmother''s voice/memory and journal serve as mentor; (5) Crossing
    the Threshold—Maya leaves village at dawn; (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies—Mountain climb,
    physical struggle, self-doubt as enemy; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave—Arrival at
    shrine ruins; (8) Ordeal—Failed attempts to force clay, emotional breakdown; (9)
    Reward—Discovery of journal, revelation about listening; (10) Road Back—Treacherous
    descent with vessel, storm, temptation to abandon; (11) Resurrection—Maya''s transformation
    complete, she becomes ''keeper of deep waters''; (12) Return with Elixir—WEAK/MISSING.
    While water returns and village is saved, the ''elixir'' moment lacks explicit
    community transformation or Maya''s changed status being recognized/integrated.
    The ending focuses on Maya''s internal state rather than demonstrating how the
    community has been transformed by her return. PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact—Maya
    (protagonist), pottery/ceramics (central), grandmother''s legacy (journal, memory,
    tools), mountain shrine (three-day journey), dried spring (central problem), surrender
    theme (explicit in journal revelation and final acceptance), transformation (clear
    arc from rigid maker to listener). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Strong adherence to monomyth
    structure with clear progression through stages. Minor weakness: Resurrection
    and Return with Elixir stages could be more distinctly separated and developed.
    TONE: Excellent maintenance of quiet, meditative, transformative voice throughout.
    Sensory details (clay texture, wind, moonlight, water sound) enhance contemplative
    quality. WORD COUNT ISSUE: 865 words exceeds 800-word maximum by 65 words (8.1%
    over), representing a material constraint violation.'
