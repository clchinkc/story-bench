  evidence: "BEATS ANALYSIS: Present: (1) Ordinary World\u2014Maya's studio, simple\
    \ pottery, safe life; (2) Call to Adventure\u2014Elder arrives with request about\
    \ master's vessel; (3) Refusal of Call\u2014Maya explicitly refuses, retreats\
    \ behind wheel; (4) Meeting the Mentor\u2014Grandmother's voice/memory and journal\
    \ serve as mentor; (5) Crossing the Threshold\u2014Maya leaves village at dawn;\
    \ (6) Tests/Allies/Enemies\u2014Mountain climb, physical struggle, self-doubt\
    \ as enemy; (7) Approach to Inmost Cave\u2014Arrival at shrine ruins; (8) Ordeal\u2014\
    Failed attempts to force clay, emotional breakdown; (9) Reward\u2014Discovery\
    \ of journal, revelation about listening; (10) Road Back\u2014Treacherous descent\
    \ with vessel, storm, temptation to abandon; (11) Resurrection\u2014Maya's transformation\
    \ complete, she becomes 'keeper of deep waters'; (12) Return with Elixir\u2014\
    WEAK/MISSING. While water returns and village is saved, the 'elixir' moment lacks\
    \ explicit community transformation or Maya's changed status being recognized/integrated.\
    \ The ending focuses on Maya's internal state rather than demonstrating how the\
    \ community has been transformed by her return. PRESERVATION: All 7 elements intact\u2014\
    Maya (protagonist), pottery/ceramics (central), grandmother's legacy (journal,\
    \ memory, tools), mountain shrine (three-day journey), dried spring (central problem),\
    \ surrender theme (explicit in journal revelation and final acceptance), transformation\
    \ (clear arc from rigid maker to listener). STRUCTURAL ACCURACY: Strong adherence\
    \ to monomyth structure with clear progression through stages. Minor weakness:\
    \ Resurrection and Return with Elixir stages could be more distinctly separated\
    \ and developed. TONE: Excellent maintenance of quiet, meditative, transformative\
    \ voice throughout. Sensory details (clay texture, wind, moonlight, water sound)\
    \ enhance contemplative quality. WORD COUNT ISSUE: 865 words exceeds 800-word\
    \ maximum by 65 words (8.1% over), representing a material constraint violation."
