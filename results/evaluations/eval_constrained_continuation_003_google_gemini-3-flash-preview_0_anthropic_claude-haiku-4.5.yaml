  detailed_analysis:
    beats_analysis:
      Search: Present - Jin integrates research into the Collective's network and
        seeks a way to broadcast findings; he peels back layers of code to understand
        the technology
      Find: Present - Jin discovers the hidden subroutines and the true purpose of
        the carbon capture technology (the ionization veil/planetary cage); he finds
        the high-gain array platform
      Take: Present - Jin makes the moral compromise, strips away purification protocols,
        and begins the upload to activate the ionization veil, paying the price of
        abandoning Earth's billions
    must_include_analysis:
      1_unfamiliar_culture: Excellent - The Spoke marketplace, recycled air, low-gravity
        physiology, frontier town indifference, brutal survival mathematics all vividly
        establish the alien culture
      2_mentor_figure: Excellent - Elara serves as guide and mentor, teaching Jin
        that heroism is irrelevant and technicians matter; she later tempts him with
        the moral compromise
      3_unexpected_discovery: Excellent - The revelation that carbon capture technology
        is actually a tool for planetary isolation and atmospheric ionization is a
        profound twist
      4_finding_what_wanted: Excellent - Jin finds both safety (sanctuary in the Collective)
        and the platform (high-gain array) to continue his fight
      5_action_with_cost: 'Excellent - Jin''s decision to activate the ionization
        veil has immediate and absolute cost: abandoning billions on Earth'
      6_moral_compromise: 'Excellent - The central tension: save the few in orbit
        by condemning the many on the surface; Jin chooses personal/collective safety
        over planetary salvation'
    must_not_analysis:
      1_easy_integration: Successfully avoided - Jin faces cold indifference, is offered
        only a terminal and system failures, must prove himself through work
      2_earth_family_contact: Successfully avoided - No family members appear or are
        contacted
      3_violence_weapons: Successfully avoided - Conflict is entirely ideological
        and technological, no physical violence
      4_complete_resolution: Successfully avoided - The conspiracy remains active;
        Jin's choice doesn't resolve it, only perpetuates it in a new form
    tone_analysis: The contemplative, politically charged tone is masterfully maintained
      throughout. The prose balances technical detail with philosophical introspection.
      Phrases like 'buying his life with the light of a world' and 'architect of the
      dark' demonstrate sophisticated political and personal stakes. Minor deduction
      (0.05) only because the opening exposition could be slightly more subtle, though
      it effectively establishes context.
    ending_analysis: 'Perfect execution of the ''Take'' beat. Jin has gained sanctuary
      and platform access but paid the ultimate price: complicity in planetary isolation.
      The ending captures the hollow victory, the moral corruption, and leaves Jin
      transformed from rebel to compromised architect. The final line ''He was no
      longer a rebel; he was an architect of the dark'' crystallizes the character
      change required by the Story Circle.'
