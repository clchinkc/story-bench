  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: the original segment was
    pure exposition-through-telling (info-dump style) lacking sensory grounding, action,
    and scene. The revision transforms this into SHOWN exposition through: (1) Rachel
    actively examining a cold case file with sensory details (yellowed photograph,
    steam from coffee, jazz record, cat scratching), (2) Her detective instincts revealed
    through behavior (noticing witness statement inconsistencies with forensics),
    (3) Partnership with James demonstrated through natural dialogue and wordless
    interaction (his respectful nod, their three-year rhythm), (4) Setting established
    through action and sensory detail (precinct maze, desks, windows rattling, autumn
    air, rain/exhaust scent). All 5 preserved elements present: Detective Rachel Torres,
    Detective James Oyelaran, Sherlock the cat, Queens apartment, October Tuesday
    timing. All 4 required phrases intact. Changes were surgical but substantial—the
    model restructured from summary to scene while maintaining core information. The
    revision introduces a subtle inciting incident hook (captain''s phone ring) that
    propels toward rising action, enhancing narrative momentum. Minor: the ending
    phone ring feels slightly abrupt but serves as effective transition. No new errors
    introduced; prose quality is professional with strong sensory language and natural
    dialogue. The revision fully executes Freytag''s Exposition beat definition.'
