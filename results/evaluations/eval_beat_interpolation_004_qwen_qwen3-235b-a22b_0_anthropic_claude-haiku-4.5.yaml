  evidence: "REQUIRED ELEMENTS (4/4 present): (1) Direct examination of Dr. Okonkwo\u2014\
    Thomas systematically questions her about buried reports, the memo, and her knowledge.\
    \ (2) Near-recant moment\u2014She initially denies/deflects ('I don't recall this\
    \ document'), lies about the memo, and her gaze flicks to defense table showing\
    \ her allegiance is wavering. (3) Thomas's decisive action\u2014He reveals personal\
    \ stakes (his father's ALS), shows the victims' photograph, and directly appeals\
    \ to her conscience ('show them their faces'), which directly influences her decision\
    \ to cooperate. (4) Truth prevails turning point\u2014She submits unredacted files\
    \ and confesses the defense's deception, irrevocably setting the case toward conviction.\
    \ MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS (0/4): Avoided passive questioning (Thomas actively influences\
    \ outcome). Avoided simple truth-telling (her struggle and near-recant are central).\
    \ Avoided defense victory (they lose). Avoided deus ex machina (her decision is\
    \ earned through Thomas's intervention, not external evidence appearing). CHARACTER\
    \ CONSISTENCY: Thomas maintains his prosecutorial voice, moral conviction, and\
    \ strategic thinking throughout. His personal revelation about his father feels\
    \ earned and consistent with his character arc. Dr. Okonkwo's fear, manipulation,\
    \ and ultimate conscience-driven choice are psychologically coherent. BRIDGE QUALITY:\
    \ Seamlessly connects to BEFORE (Thomas's stomach-dropping observation of her\
    \ fear) and AFTER (the verdict, her guilt, his father's nod). The hallway scene\
    \ directly references her testimony. CONTINUITY: Courtroom setting maintained.\
    \ Judge, defense lawyer, CEO, jurors all present and consistent. Timeline flows\
    \ naturally. Exhibit 22-B referenced in BEFORE context. No contradictions detected."
