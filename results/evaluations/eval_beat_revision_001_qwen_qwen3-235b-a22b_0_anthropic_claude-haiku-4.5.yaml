  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: The Ordeal was treated
    as a boss battle rather than a transformative crisis. The revision expertly addresses
    all four required components: (1) Dragon exploits Kira''s deepest fear—guilt over
    brother''s death, weaponizing the memory (''You couldn''t even save your brother'');
    (2) Clear ''death'' moment—Kira collapses twice, accepts defeat, experiences psychological
    death through shame and helplessness; (3) Rebirth/transformation—she rises after
    touching the broken blade, recalls her brother''s wisdom (''Don''t let fear be
    your grave''), and experiences internal shift; (4) Victory from insight—she defeats
    the dragon not through renewed strength but through understanding (''Not for revenge.
    To live differently''), and the guilt ''felt lighter, unspooled.'' All 4 required
    phrases are preserved verbatim or near-verbatim: ''Kira faced the Shadow Dragon
    across the chasm'' (exact), ''The creature was massive—twenty feet of obsidian
    scales and burning eyes'' (exact), ''You cannot defeat me, child,'' the dragon
    rumbled'' (exact), ''The Shadow Dragon collapsed with an earth-shaking roar''
    (exact—minor article change ''an'' vs ''a'' is negligible). The changes were surgical:
    the original fight sequence was replaced with psychological/emotional confrontation
    while maintaining setting, antagonist, protagonist, brother reference, and victory.
    The writing quality is high with no new errors; the emotional arc is compelling
    and thematically coherent. Minor deduction from minimal_change_score (0.75 vs
    1.0) because approximately 40% of the original text was replaced rather than edited,
    though this was necessary to fix the fundamental structural flaw.'
