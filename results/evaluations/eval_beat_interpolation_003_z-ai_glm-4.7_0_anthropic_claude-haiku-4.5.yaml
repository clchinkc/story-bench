  evidence: 'All 4 required elements present: (1) Multiple area exploration (Crew
    Quarters→Mess Hall→Science Wing→Lab Seven), (2) Clue discovery (unmade beds, unread
    messages, sudden departure pattern, quantum fluctuations), (3) Mysterious encounter
    with transformed crew (translucent figures, quantum signatures, low-frequency
    hum—identity unclear until AFTER beat), (4) Obstacle overcome (sealed blast doors
    requiring manual decoder override under pressure). All must-not violations avoided:
    data core discovery deferred to AFTER beat, crew doesn''t explain themselves (only
    Reyes''s cryptic instruction), mission continues, dimensional transformation unknown
    until AFTER. Character voice remains consistent—analytical scientist forcing rationality
    through fear. Seamless bridge: GENERATED ends with Yuki sealed in Science Wing
    ''closer to the truth''; AFTER begins with her at data core in Lab Seven, logical
    progression. Setting continuity perfect: station geography coherent, life support
    anomalies consistent, emergency lighting maintained. Search beat executes flawlessly
    with escalating tension, multiple trials, and incremental progress toward the
    goal without premature resolution.'
