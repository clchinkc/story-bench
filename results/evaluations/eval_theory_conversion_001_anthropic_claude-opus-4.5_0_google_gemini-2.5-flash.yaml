  evidence: All 5 target beats are clearly present and well-defined according to Freytag's
    Pyramid. All 6 core elements are preserved. The structure perfectly aligns with
    the target theory. The tone of medical thriller tension with ethical weight is
    consistently maintained throughout the narrative.
