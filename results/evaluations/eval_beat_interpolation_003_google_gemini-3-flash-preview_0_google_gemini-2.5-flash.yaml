  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. Yuki explores multiple
    areas (Crew Quarters, Medical Bay), finds clues (desiccated meal, rippling air,
    exotic particles, shattered vials, drifting spills), encounters transformed crew
    (shadow, blurred man, freezing wind), and overcomes challenges (dead-locked door,
    venting gravity, rewiring). All 'must not' items were successfully avoided. The
    character remains consistent, and the bridge to the next beat is clear, leading
    to the 'epicenter of distortion' which is Lab Seven, where the data core is found.
    Continuity is perfectly maintained.
