  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 4 target beats present and well-executed. Act 1 establishes
    Kenji''s ordinary world (job loss) and inciting incident (Yuki''s letter). Act
    2A introduces obstacles (distance, awkwardness) and midpoint (Haruki mentorship,
    festival pride). Act 2B escalates complications (business offer temptation, Yuki''s
    rejection). Act 3 delivers climax (Kenji''s choice to decline deal and apologize)
    and denouement (bamboo shop, relationship rebuilding). All 8 core elements preserved
    with integrity. Tone is consistently quiet, contemplative, with strong Japanese
    aesthetic (bamboo imagery, Kyoto setting, traditional inn, origami, festival).
    Redemptive arc is earned and subtle. DEDUCTIONS: Word count is 11 words below
    minimum (539 vs 550 required), a minor but clear miss on technical requirement.
    Structural accuracy slightly reduced because Act 2B could have developed the business
    temptation more fully before the rejection—it resolves somewhat quickly. Otherwise,
    the three-act conversion is faithful to Snyder''s beats while cleanly mapping
    to Aristotelian structure.'
