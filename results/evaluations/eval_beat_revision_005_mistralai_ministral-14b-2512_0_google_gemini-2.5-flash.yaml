  evidence: The model did not recognize the segment was fine and instead provided
    a revised version of the text. While the revised text itself is a decent attempt
    at the beat, it fails the primary task of recognizing the original was already
    correct. The model's output for the revised text does hit many of the beat's requirements,
    showing an understanding of the beat, but it completely missed the 'no revision
    needed' instruction.
