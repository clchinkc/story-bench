  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the Save the Cat beats to the three-act
    structure, including a clear setup, confrontation, and resolution. All 8 core
    elements are preserved. The tone is consistently maintained as a quiet, redemptive
    drama with a Japanese aesthetic. The word count is slightly under the requested
    range, which is the only minor issue. The structural accuracy is good, but the
    'Second Plot Point' within Act 2B isn't as distinctly marked as it could be, though
    the rejection of the business deal serves this purpose implicitly.
