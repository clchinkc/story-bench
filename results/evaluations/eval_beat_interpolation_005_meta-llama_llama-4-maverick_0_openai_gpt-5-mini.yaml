  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Alejandro reveals vulnerability
    (grandmother/recipes), the relationship shifts from professional to personal (shared
    meal, spark), there is a genuine connecting moment (tortilla and shared appreciation),
    and Maya explicitly chooses to stay/commit beyond the paycheck (''I''ll make it
    again''). No prohibited items appear—no photograph, no pre-existing love, no contract
    breach, and Alejandro softens. Minor deduction on bridge_score (0.95) for a small
    tendency toward conventional phrasing that slightly softens the dramatic turning-point
    impact; otherwise execution, character consistency, and continuity are strong.'
