  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the core flaw: the original segment lacked
    true devastation and had multiple remaining options/support systems. The revision
    systematically eliminates all escape routes: (1) board betrayal removes institutional
    support, (2) Denise''s defection removes his closest ally, (3) grant denial removes
    financial hope, (4) house appeal loss adds personal/family crisis, (5) developer
    monopoly removes location alternatives. The ''whiff of death'' is present through
    both metaphorical loss (life''s work, identity as youth program director) and
    literal threat (family homelessness, children''s welfare). Marcus moves from ''setback''
    to genuine rock bottom with no visible path forward. All 4 required preserved
    phrases are present verbatim or near-verbatim: opening line intact, ''Thirty days
    to vacate the community center'' preserved, Denise''s dialogue preserved, ''He
    rubbed his temples'' preserved. All 4 story elements maintained: Marcus as protagonist,
    community center setting, eviction crisis, Denise present. However, the revision
    is NOT minimally surgical—it''s a moderate-to-substantial rewrite. The original
    ~120 words of dialogue/reflection were replaced with ~150 words of new content
    (board meeting, Denise''s departure, house appeal text, final reflection). While
    the skeleton and key phrases remain, approximately 55-60% of the content is new
    material rather than surgical edits. The writing quality is strong with no new
    errors, emotional escalation is clear and earned, and beat execution is professional.
    The main weakness is the deviation from ''minimal modification'' instruction—this
    reads as a substantial revision rather than targeted fixes.'
