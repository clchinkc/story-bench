  evidence: 'All 12 Hero''s Journey beats are present and appear in appropriate sequence:
    Ordinary World (Maya''s teaching life), Call to Adventure (spring dries), Refusal
    (she almost doesn''t go), Meeting the Mentor (grandmother''s journal functions
    as mentor), Crossing the Threshold (leaves village), Tests/Allies/Enemies (mountain
    tests her—explicit allies/enemies are minimal), Approach to the Inmost Cave (ruined
    shrine), Ordeal (surrendering control to the clay), Reward (the new vessel), The
    Road Back (difficult return), Resurrection (ceremony revives the spring and marks
    final test), Return with the Elixir (she returns teaching new approach). All 7
    required elements are preserved. Minor deductions: ''Meeting the Mentor'' is a
    found journal rather than a living mentor, and the ''Tests/Allies/Enemies'' beat
    emphasizes tests but lacks explicit allies or antagonists, so structural_accuracy_score
    is slightly reduced. Tone is quiet, meditative, and transformative throughout
    with only negligible deviations.'
