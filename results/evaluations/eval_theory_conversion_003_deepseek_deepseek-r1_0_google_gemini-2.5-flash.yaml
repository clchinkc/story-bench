  evidence: The conversion successfully maps the original beats to the three-act structure,
    hitting all four target beats. All 8 core elements are preserved. The tone is
    consistently maintained. Structural accuracy is good, but the transition from
    Act 2A to 2B could be slightly more distinct, as the 'Midpoint' (Yuki's radiance)
    and 'Bad Guys Close In' (business rivals) feel a bit close together without a
    clear escalation in between, though it's still functionally correct.
