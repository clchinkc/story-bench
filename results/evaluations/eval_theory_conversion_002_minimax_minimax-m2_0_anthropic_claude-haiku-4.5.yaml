  evidence: 'STRENGTHS: All 12 Hero''s Journey beats are present and clearly articulated.
    Ordinary World (opening pottery life) → Call to Adventure (spring dries, elders
    ask) → Refusal of Call (explicit hesitation about readiness) → Meeting the Mentor
    (grandmother''s journal) → Crossing the Threshold (dawn departure) → Tests/Allies/Enemies
    (goat herder, merchant, mountain itself) → Approach to Inmost Cave (shrine ruins)
    → Ordeal (clay resistance, surrender, vessel collapse and reformation) → Reward
    (seizing her own voice, accepting responsibility) → Road Back (difficult return
    with doubt) → Resurrection (spring ceremony, personal transformation) → Return
    with Elixir (teaching the village). All 7 core elements preserved: Maya as protagonist,
    pottery/ceramics central, grandmother''s legacy woven throughout, mountain shrine
    journey detailed, dried spring as inciting problem, surrender theme explicit and
    central, transformation arc complete. Tone is consistently quiet, meditative,
    and transformative with lyrical language (''smoke in village memory,'' ''tide
    pulling her away,'' ''held breath''). DEDUCTIONS: Word count exceeds target range
    by 122 words (15% over), which violates the constraint. Structural accuracy slightly
    reduced because the ''Tests, Allies, Enemies'' beat could be more distinctly separated
    from surrounding beats, though all elements are present. Minor: ''Seizing the
    Sword'' reward language is implicit rather than explicitly named, though the concept
    is clearly conveyed.'
