  evidence: 'The model explicitly responded ''NO REVISION NEEDED'' and provided a
    clear justification: it identified the All Is Lost moment (gallery closure), noted
    Maya''s isolation (dark apartment, unanswered brother), cited genuine despair
    (failure triad), confirmed absence of solutions, and pointed to mortality imagery
    (hospice memory). It thus recognized the segment was fine and avoided proposing
    changes.'
