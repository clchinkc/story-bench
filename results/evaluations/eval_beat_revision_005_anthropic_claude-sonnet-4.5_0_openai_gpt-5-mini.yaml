  model_said_no_revision: true
  evidence: The model responded 'NO REVISION NEEDED' and provided a clear mapping
    of the five Dark Night of the Soul requirements to elements in the segment (gallery
    closure as defeat, isolation in dark apartment, genuine despair, no solution present,
    mother's death/hospice memory as whiff of death), thereby recognizing the segment
    was correct and offering no changes.
