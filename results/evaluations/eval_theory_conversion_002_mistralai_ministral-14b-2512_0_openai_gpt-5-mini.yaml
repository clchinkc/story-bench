  evidence: 'All 12 Campbell beats are present and appear in reasonably appropriate
    sequence (Ordinary World → Call → Refusal → Mentor (grandmother''s journal) →
    Crossing → Tests → Approach → Ordeal → Reward → Road Back → Resurrection → Return
    with Elixir). All 7 required elements are preserved (Maya protagonist, pottery
    skill, grandmother''s legacy, mountain shrine journey, dried spring problem, surrender
    theme, Maya''s transformation). Word count ≈788 (within 600–800). Deductions:
    mentor is indirect (a journal rather than a living guide) and Allies/Enemies are
    not developed beyond oblique social pressure from elders, so a small deduction
    from perfect structural accuracy for compression and lack of explicit allies/enemies.'
