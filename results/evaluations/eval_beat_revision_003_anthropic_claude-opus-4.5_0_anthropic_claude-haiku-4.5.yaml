  evidence: "The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation\
    \ and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.\
    \ The revision fixes this by: (1) Having Sophie articulate the meditation insight\
    \ ('five days of silence'), (2) Demonstrating changed behavior through the phone-down\
    \ action (contrasts with original immediate email-checking), (3) Showing her mother's\
    \ surprise ('Since when?'), (4) Providing explicit contrast ('everything exactly\
    \ as she'd left it\u2014but she was seeing it differently now'), (5) Ending with\
    \ changed priorities ('the feeling of it, not the returning to productivity').\
    \ All 4 required phrases preserved: 'Sophie's flight landed at O'Hare' (exact),\
    \ 'How was Thailand?' her mother asked' (exact), 'The familiar Chicago skyline\
    \ appeared' (exact), ''It's good to be home,' she said' (exact). Changes were\
    \ surgical rather than wholesale\u2014the core structure, setting, characters,\
    \ and work pressure element remain intact. The revision adds ~100 words of introspection\
    \ and behavioral contrast while maintaining the original's skeleton. Minor: the\
    \ beat definition mentions 'integrated' but cuts off mid-word in the prompt, so\
    \ full alignment cannot be perfectly verified, though the revision clearly integrates\
    \ the retreat lesson into her present choices. Writing quality is professional\
    \ with no new errors introduced."
