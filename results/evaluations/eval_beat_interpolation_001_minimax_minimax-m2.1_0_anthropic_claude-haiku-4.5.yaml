  evidence: 'All four required elements present: (1) Marcus introduced as mentor character
    with established wisdom and mysterious background; (2) Practical wisdom delivered
    (''forest tests intentions, not abilities'') and tangible tools provided (compass,
    pouch, herbs); (3) Elena''s doubt shifts to reluctant acceptance (''Reluctant.
    Uncertain. But no longer entirely refusal''); (4) Librarian skills reframed as
    valuable (''Someone who finds patterns no one else sees. Who researches the obscure
    and connects the forgotten''). All must-not violations avoided: Elena remains
    doubtful and uncertain, Marcus provides guidance without solving problems or accompanying
    her, setting is the curiosity shop (not forest), no magical powers discovered.
    Character voice consistent throughout—Elena''s skepticism and practical nature
    maintained, Marcus''s enigmatic wisdom established. Bridge between refusal and
    threshold beats is seamless: Elena moves from absolute rejection to tentative
    acceptance. Continuity perfect: grandmother''s ghost referenced, map acknowledged,
    village setting maintained. Execution of mentor beat is exemplary—Marcus embodies
    the archetypal mentor who provides exactly what the hero needs without removing
    agency or challenge.'
