  evidence: "STRENGTHS: All 4 required elements present and well-executed. (1) Direct\
    \ examination occurs with Thomas asking about suppressed data and research division\
    \ experience. (2) Clear near-recant moment: 'I\u2026 I am not sure if\u2026' with\
    \ doubt clouding her eyes and threat of recantation. (3) Thomas takes decisive\
    \ action through emotional appeal (17 lives), the memorial photograph, and reference\
    \ to her daughter's treatment\u2014these are character-driven choices that influence\
    \ her decision. (4) Turning point clearly marked: 'I will not recant. I affirm\
    \ every word' with courtroom eruption confirming the shift. All must-not items\
    \ avoided: Dr. Okonkwo shows genuine internal struggle before committing; Thomas\
    \ is highly active and influential (not passive); the case proceeds toward victory;\
    \ no external deus ex machina. MINOR DEDUCTIONS: Character voice slightly shifts\
    \ toward melodrama in places ('each word cutting through her internal conflict')\
    \ which is slightly inconsistent with the grounded, legal-thriller tone of the\
    \ BEFORE section. Bridge between beats is seamless\u2014the verdict and its aftermath\
    \ flow naturally from this climactic moment. Setting continuity perfect\u2014\
    courtroom maintained throughout. Word count 345 falls comfortably within 300-450\
    \ range."
