  evidence: "STRENGTHS: Sarah considers recanting (element 1), considers official\
    \ channels via Marcus Webb (element 2), and shows internal conflict between duty\
    \ and love (element 3). Character voice is consistent and compelling. Bridge to\
    \ Break Into Two is logical. WEAKNESSES: Missing element 4\u2014no clear moment\
    \ that tips her toward the third option; the decision feels abrupt rather than\
    \ earned through debate. VIOLATIONS: (1) Sarah already decides to go rogue and\
    \ calls the kidnapper mid-beat, essentially skipping the debate's deliberative\
    \ function and jumping to action. (2) She resigns from the force before the Break\
    \ Into Two beat, which should be the commitment point. The resignation letter\
    \ is written/slid under the door during the Debate beat itself, violating the\
    \ structural requirement that this decision comes AFTER the debate concludes.\
    \ The narrative conflates Debate and Break Into Two rather than keeping them distinct.\
    \ EXECUTION: The beat reads more as action/decision-making than genuine debate.\
    \ Marcus provides alternatives, but Sarah dismisses them quickly without real\
    \ wrestling. The third option (going rogue as a vigilante) emerges from necessity\
    \ rather than from Sarah's deliberation, making it feel imposed rather than chosen."
