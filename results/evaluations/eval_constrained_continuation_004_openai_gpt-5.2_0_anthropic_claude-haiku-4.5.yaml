  analysis:
    beats_analysis: "Both required beats are clearly present and well-executed. First\
      \ Plot Point occurs when Eleanor declares 'Blackwood & Sons will continue operations'\
      \ and commits to publishing the serial\u2014a definitive point of no return.\
      \ Act 2 Opening begins immediately after with Eleanor's decision to 'print'\
      \ and her crossing into the composing room to set the first instalment, establishing\
      \ the new world of consequences and rising action."
    must_include_analysis: "All 6 elements successfully included: (1) Eleanor's decision\
      \ to publish is explicit and central; (2) Central conflict (profit vs. ethics/danger)\
      \ is thoroughly established through Thomas's warnings and Eleanor's internal\
      \ struggle; (3) Eleanor defies Victorian expectations throughout\u2014entering\
      \ the shop ungloved, commanding men, making business decisions; (4) Thomas Chen\
      \ is a fully realized ally with personal stakes (family's livelihood, his own\
      \ position); (5) Danger is hinted at through the manuscript's connection to\
      \ Whitechapel murders and Thomas's warnings about police anger and neighborhood\
      \ backlash; (6) Eleanor crosses an irreversible threshold\u2014the final image\
      \ of 'letters fall into place\u2014cold, leaden, irreversible' and 'the threshold\
      \ close behind her with the soft finality of a door in a tomb' emphasizes the\
      \ point of no return."
    must_not_analysis: "All 4 forbidden elements successfully avoided: (1) Jack the\
      \ Ripper never appears as a character; (2) No graphic violence or murder descriptions\u2014\
      the manuscript is referenced but never detailed; (3) No romantic subplot between\
      \ Eleanor and Thomas\u2014their relationship remains professional and respectful,\
      \ with Thomas's pride 'disciplined into obedience'; (4) No easy solution\u2014\
      the financial crisis remains acute and the path forward is dangerous and uncertain."
    tone_analysis: "Gothic tension and Victorian atmosphere are masterfully maintained\
      \ throughout. Language choices ('murder of crows,' 'paper warming against her\
      \ ribs like a guilty secret,' 'the threshold close behind her with the soft\
      \ finality of a door in a tomb') create sustained dread. Feminist undertones\
      \ are strong but not heavy-handed\u2014Eleanor's agency is demonstrated through\
      \ action rather than declaration. Minor deduction only for occasional moments\
      \ where contemporary phrasing slightly softens the period atmosphere."
    ending_analysis: "Perfect execution. Eleanor is fully committed to the dangerous\
      \ path, Act 2 is clearly begun with the presses running and consequences set\
      \ in motion. The final image is powerful and definitive\u2014she has crossed\
      \ into a new world from which there is no retreat. The tone shifts from deliberation\
      \ to action, and the story momentum is clearly established for complications\
      \ ahead."
