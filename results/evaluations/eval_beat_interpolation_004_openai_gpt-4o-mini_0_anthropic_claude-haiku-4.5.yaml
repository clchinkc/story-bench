  evidence: 'All four required elements present: (1) Direct examination with specific
    questions about trial processes and adverse reactions; (2) Clear near-recant moment
    where Dr. Okonkwo reveals threats to her daughter and hesitates (''I can''t lose
    her''); (3) Thomas takes decisive action by interrupting, directly confronting
    her with moral argument about the 17 lives and the burden of complicity; (4) Turning
    point clearly marked when she shifts from fear to resolve (''You''re right...I
    will testify''). All must-not items avoided: she struggles internally before testifying,
    Thomas actively influences outcome through persuasion, defense doesn''t win, no
    external deus ex machina. Character voice consistent—Thomas shows appropriate
    desperation and moral conviction; Dr. Okonkwo''s fear and eventual resolve ring
    true. Bridge to falling action seamless: verdict follows logically from her testimony.
    Setting maintained throughout courtroom. Minor deduction (0.05) on character score
    for Thomas''s dialogue being slightly more theatrical than his established voice
    in BEFORE section, though still appropriate for climactic moment.'
