  evidence: The model correctly identified that the original segment did not fully
    convey 'All Is Lost'. It addressed the lack of hopelessness by having Marcus question
    the viability of the fundraiser and grant, and by showing Denise's hope faltering,
    leading to Marcus feeling isolated. The 'whiff of death' is present metaphorically
    with the center 'slipping away' and Marcus's identity crumbling. The changes were
    not surgical, but they did build upon the existing text rather than rewriting
    it entirely. The core elements and required phrases were preserved. The only minor
    issue is that the fundraiser and grant aren't explicitly 'failed' yet, but Marcus's
    and Denise's doubt about them is strong enough to convey the 'all is lost' feeling.
