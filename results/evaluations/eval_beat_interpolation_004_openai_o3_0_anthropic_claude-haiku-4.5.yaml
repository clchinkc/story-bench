  evidence: 'All four required elements present and executed excellently: (1) Direct
    examination of Dr. Okonkwo with specific questions about Remetyx trials and Exhibit
    42; (2) Clear near-recant moment—''I don''t recall writing that'' followed by
    defense objection; (3) Thomas takes decisive action—hostile witness designation,
    emotional appeal referencing her daughter, strategic placement of Miguel Alvarez
    photo and Johns Hopkins card as silent promise; (4) Turning point clearly marked—Dr.
    Okonkwo''s shoulders sag, she recognizes the memo, points to CEO, truth prevails.
    All must-not items avoided: Dr. Okonkwo''s struggle is visceral and internal (tears,
    flinching, hesitation); Thomas is highly active and influential (not passive);
    defense loses; no deus ex machina (evidence already existed, Thomas''s persuasion
    is the catalyst). Character voice remains consistent—Thomas''s measured professionalism,
    Dr. Okonkwo''s fear-driven conflict, CEO''s subtle intimidation. Bridge from BEFORE
    to AFTER is seamless: the courtroom setting continues, the same characters and
    stakes carry through. Continuity perfect: no contradictions in setting, character
    positions, or narrative logic. This is a professionally executed climax that maximizes
    tension, forces the protagonist''s decisive choice, and irrevocably determines
    the story''s outcome.'
