  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that NO REVISION NEEDED and provided comprehensive
    reasoning. The model accurately recognized all five key requirements were satisfied:
    (1) follows major defeat (gallery closure), (2) protagonist isolated (dark apartment,
    unanswered calls), (3) genuine despair and reflection (sitting on floor, tears,
    internal monologue about failure), (4) no solutions presented (wallowing phase),
    and (5) whiff of death element (hospice memory, mother''s passing, broken promise).
    The model demonstrated strong beat understanding by explaining HOW each requirement
    was met in the text, avoided the false positive trap of over-diagnosing problems
    in well-executed prose, and provided clear, specific reasoning tied directly to
    Save the Cat theory. The response shows the model resisted the temptation to ''improve''
    already-effective writing.'
