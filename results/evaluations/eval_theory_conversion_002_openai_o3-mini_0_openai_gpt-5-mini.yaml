  evidence: 'All 12 Campbell beats are identifiable in sequence and all 7 core elements
    are retained. Small deductions: the Ordeal is relatively understated (more meditative
    than a high-stakes crisis), and the Reward and Resurrection moments overlap somewhat,
    reducing distinct tonal contrast between those late beats. Overall structure and
    tone are very well preserved.'
