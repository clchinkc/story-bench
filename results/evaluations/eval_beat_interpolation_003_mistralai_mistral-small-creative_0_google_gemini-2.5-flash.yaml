  evidence: All required elements are present and well-executed. The 'Search' beat's
    narrative function is clearly fulfilled through exploration, discovery of clues,
    and encounters with the transformed crew. All 'must not' conditions are avoided.
    Character and setting continuity are excellent, and the bridge to the next beat
    is seamless.
