  evidence: "REQUIRED ELEMENTS (4/4): (1) Marcus introduced as mentor character with\
    \ distinctive voice and physical presence (scarred, dragon-bone cane, gravel laugh);\
    \ (2) Practical wisdom provided ('forest tests intentions, not abilities,' 'read\
    \ it' instead of fighting, compass that points to intent) and tangible tools (satchel,\
    \ compass); (3) Elena's doubt shifts to reluctant acceptance ('panic was still\
    \ there, but beneath it, a small, stubborn curiosity had taken root'); (4) Librarian\
    \ skills reframed as useful ('organize chaos into order,' 'listen to stories and\
    \ find truth in margins,' 'weapon'). MUST-NOT VIOLATIONS (0/4 avoided): Elena\
    \ remains doubtful and resistant throughout, not confident; Marcus explicitly\
    \ does not accompany her ('does not solve their problems'); setting is curiosity\
    \ shop, not forest; no magical powers discovered. EXECUTION: Perfectly executes\
    \ mentor beat function\u2014Marcus provides wisdom, tools, and reframing of Elena's\
    \ self-perception without solving her problems. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Elena's\
    \ voice remains consistent (skeptical librarian), Marcus's voice is distinctive\
    \ and memorable. BRIDGE QUALITY: Seamless transition from refusal to mentor meeting\
    \ to threshold crossing; each beat flows naturally. CONTINUITY: Setting (village\
    \ shop) is consistent with 'BEFORE' context, and the 'AFTER' section properly\
    \ shows Elena at forest edge with Marcus's gifts, maintaining logical progression."
