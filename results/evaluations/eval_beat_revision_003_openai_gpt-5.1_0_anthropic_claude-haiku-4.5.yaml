  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the actual flaw: Sophie showed no transformation
    and immediately reverted to old workaholic patterns, making the journey meaningless.
    The revision fixes this precisely by: (1) inserting the meditation teacher''s
    voice (''Notice the urge. Breathe. Choose.'') as integrated insight, (2) showing
    Sophie actively choosing differently—locking the phone instead of opening email,
    deciding to delay work response, (3) demonstrating behavioral change through physical
    markers (phone in bag not hand, letting it buzz), (4) creating clear contrast
    between old automatic response (''You know how it is'') and new conscious choice,
    (5) having the mother explicitly notice the change (''That''s new''). All 4 required
    phrases preserved exactly: ''Sophie''s flight landed at O''Hare'', ''How was Thailand?
    her mother asked'', ''The familiar Chicago skyline appeared'', ''It''s good to
    be home, she said''. The changes were surgical—the model inserted transformation
    evidence into the existing structure rather than rewriting. The new material (meditation
    teacher''s voice, the breathing moment, phone placement, mother''s observation,
    final reflection on ''thin new space between urgency and action'') integrates
    seamlessly. Minor: the ending reflection is slightly more literary/introspective
    than the original''s simpler tone, but this elevates rather than contradicts the
    beat requirement. The revision fully executes Return (Having Changed) by showing
    Sophie seeing her world ''as if someone had wiped a film from the glass'' and
    making a conscious decision about how to live within her routine—the journey integrated
    into her being.'
