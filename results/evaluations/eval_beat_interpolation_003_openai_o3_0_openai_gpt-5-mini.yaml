  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: multiple areas explored (corridor,
    crew quarters, medical bay, research wing), clues discovered (spiked vitals, scrawled
    message, singed lab coat, logs), encounter with transformed crew (shimmer-forms),
    and an obstacle overcome (Level-Four quarantine hot-wired). None of the prohibited
    items occur: she doesn''t immediately find the data core or understand everything,
    the crew don''t explain themselves, she doesn''t leave, and she didn''t already
    know about the dimensional change. Character behavior and setting continuity are
    consistent and the passage effectively bridges arrival to the subsequent discovery.'
