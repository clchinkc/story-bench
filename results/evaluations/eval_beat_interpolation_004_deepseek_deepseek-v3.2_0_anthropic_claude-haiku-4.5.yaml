  evidence: 'REQUIRED ELEMENTS (4/4 present): (1) Direct examination of Dr. Okonkwo—Thomas
    methodically questions her about the Astra-12 trial, protocol, and the specific
    July 12th safety report. (2) Near-recant moment—She begins evasively answering
    (''interpretations could vary''), shows fear of the CEO, and appears ready to
    deny the alterations. The narrative explicitly states ''She was going to deny
    it. She was going to save her daughter and bury the truth.'' (3) Thomas''s decisive
    action—He abandons protocol, uses her first name, and delivers a brutal emotional
    appeal about her daughter and legacy (''what will you tell her you did?''). This
    is active influence, not passive questioning. (4) Turning point where truth prevails—Her
    composure shatters, she resolves, and delivers clear testimony: ''I did not authorize
    the change...He knew.'' The gallery erupts; the case direction is irrevocably
    set. MUST-NOT ITEMS (0/4 violations): Avoided passive recitation of truth (she
    struggles internally and nearly recants). Avoided passive protagonist (Thomas
    makes a calculated, rule-breaking choice). Avoided defense winning (guilty verdict
    follows). Avoided deus ex machina (no new evidence; Thomas''s emotional appeal
    is character-driven action). CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Thomas''s voice remains consistent—strategic
    prosecutor who becomes desperate, then personal. Dr. Okonkwo''s arc from fear
    to resolution is psychologically coherent. BRIDGE QUALITY: Seamless transition
    from BEFORE (her fear, his stomach dropping) through CLIMAX (the emotional confrontation)
    to AFTER (her tears, the verdict). The hallway scene in AFTER directly references
    her internal conflict from CLIMAX. CONTINUITY: Setting remains the courtroom throughout.
    Judge, gallery, CEO, defense attorney all consistently positioned. No contradictions
    between segments.'
