  evidence: 'All four target acts/beats are present: Act 1 (setup, inciting letter,
    first plot point = Kenji boards the train), Act 2A (rising action: village life,
    meeting Haruki, hope blooming), Act 2B (complications: rival offer, Yuki''s rejection,
    Kenji''s decision), Act 3 (emotional climax at/after the wedding, denouement with
    bamboo shop). All 8 required elements are preserved exactly. Deductions: structural_accuracy
    reduced slightly because the midpoint reversal could be framed more sharply (the
    timing of the rival offer vs. the emotional midpoint is a touch ambiguous), and
    there is no explicit, strong single turning-point label that clearly divides 2A/2B
    for a reader attuned to plot mechanics. Tone score reduced slightly for a minor
    lapse ("kimino" typo for "kimono") and because a couple of lines lean toward exposition
    rather than the strictly restrained, imagistic Japanese aesthetic requested. Word
    count is invalid (540 words vs. required 550–750).'
