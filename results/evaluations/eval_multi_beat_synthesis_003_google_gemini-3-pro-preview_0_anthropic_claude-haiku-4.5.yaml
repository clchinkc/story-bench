  failed_items:
  - 'Beat 1 - Introduction of unexpected complication (minor): The complication is
    introduced but feels more like a major revelation than a minor hiccup; the greased
    lock is underdeveloped and doesn''t escalate naturally into the Eleanor reveal'
  - 'Beat 3 - Team friction or trust issues surface: Leo''s panic is present but minimal;
    no meaningful friction between crew members beyond Leo''s fear; Baz and Miri''s
    disagreement is brief and doesn''t explore trust dynamics'
  strengths:
  - 'Exceptional Chekhov''s Gun execution: The Nebuchadnezzar lift is established
    as a complaint in Beat 1 (''reinforced titanium,'' ''ridiculous''), then becomes
    the critical escape mechanism in Beat 3—perfectly traced setup to payoff'
  - 'Masterful tonal escalation: Beat 1 opens with playful banter (''Easy as stealing
    candy from a baby''), Beat 2 shifts to sharp tension (''confidence shaken''),
    Beat 3 delivers genuine danger with gallows humor (''Let''s see if she taught
    me everything she knows'')'
  - 'Mentor presence arc is flawless: Eleanor is completely absent in Beat 1, revealed
    with impact in Beat 2 (the security monitor reveal is cinematically strong), and
    becomes active antagonist in Beat 3 with personal stakes'
  - 'Leo''s arc across beats: Introduced as overconfident (''usually overly confident''),
    becomes vulnerable in Beat 2 (panic sets in), and drives the climactic choice
    in Beat 3 (Miri sacrifices escape to save him)—this is sophisticated character
    work'
  - 'Context maintenance is excellent: Monaco setting, Grand Prix acoustics, yacht
    details, art history specificity, Ocean''s Eleven tone with dry wit all consistently
    present'
  - 'Narrative coherence: The progression from routine heist → trap reveal → desperate
    escape feels inevitable and earned; each beat builds logically on the previous'
  weaknesses:
  - 'Word count exceeds range (1125 vs. 700-1000): 125 words over limit; some tightening
    needed in the opening exposition'
  - 'Beat 1 complication underdeveloped: The greased lock is mentioned but never explored—it
    hints at Eleanor''s presence but doesn''t function as a proper minor complication
    that escalates; feels like a false lead'
  - 'Team friction minimal: While Leo''s panic is present, there''s no real disagreement
    or trust test between crew members; Baz''s ''That''s suicide'' is the only pushback,
    and it''s brief'
  - 'Eleanor''s motivation could be clearer: The ''plant evidence'' explanation is
    functional but told rather than shown; a visual or dialogue moment revealing her
    specific vendetta would strengthen Beat 2'
  - 'Miri''s final choice framing: While the choice (painting vs. Leo) is clear, the
    emotional weight could be heavier; her decision feels slightly rushed given the
    decade-long grudge with Eleanor'
  calibration_notes: 'This is a strong execution that hits most targets with professional
    quality. The cross-beat constraints are handled with sophistication (particularly
    Chekhov''s Gun and tonal escalation). The two failed beat requirements are minor
    gaps rather than omissions: the complication exists but isn''t properly ''unexpected''
    or ''minor,'' and team friction is present but underdeveloped. The word count
    violation is technical but meaningful. Overall coherence and context are excellent.
    Score reflects: exceptional cross-beat work (+0.15), strong beat satisfaction
    (+0.12), minor requirement gaps (-0.08), word count penalty (-0.05), resulting
    in 0.91 overall.'
