  evidence: The 'Meeting the Mentor' beat is slightly weak as it's not a living mentor
    but a 'hallowed memory' and 'spiritual beacon' of the shrine itself, which is
    then reinforced by finding the journal. While it serves the purpose, it's not
    a direct meeting. The tone is generally good, but the word count is significantly
    over the specified range.
