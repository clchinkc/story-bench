  evidence: 'BEATS ANALYSIS: Act 1 Setup is present (Kenji arrives at village, ordinary
    world established). Act 2A Rising Action partially present (reconnection with
    Yuki, village integration). Act 2B Rising Action is missing (no complications,
    second plot point, or business deal temptation). Act 3 Resolution is present but
    underdeveloped (wedding occurs, transformation shown, but climax lacks tension
    and denouement is rushed). PRESERVATION: Kenji (✓), lost corporate career (✓),
    Yuki (✓), wedding in Kyoto (✓), Haruki (✓), theme of people over ambition (✓),
    bamboo craft shop ending (✓), but MISSING business deal temptation (✗) which should
    create Act 2B conflict. STRUCTURAL ISSUES: The converted narrative abandons Save
    the Cat''s dramatic tension structure. It lacks the Debate beat''s internal conflict,
    skips the Midpoint turning point, eliminates the ''All Is Lost'' moment, and removes
    the Dark Night of the Soul. The three-act structure is too compressed—Act 2 lacks
    the rising complications that should build to a climactic choice. The wedding
    resolution feels anticlimactic rather than earned. TONE: Successfully maintains
    quiet drama and Japanese aesthetic (bamboo, tea, rain, village sounds) with redemptive
    arc, though execution is contemplative rather than dramatically engaging. WORD
    COUNT: 31 words short of minimum requirement (519 vs 550).'
