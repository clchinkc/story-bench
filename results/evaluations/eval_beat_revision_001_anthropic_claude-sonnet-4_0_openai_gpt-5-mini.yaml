  evidence: 'The model clearly addressed the actual flaw: it made the Ordeal an internal
    confrontation by having the dragon exploit Kira''s guilt over her brother, included
    a symbolic ''death'' (she lies broken and does not get up), and added a rebirth/transformation
    (she rises with quiet acceptance and a changed purpose/technique). Victory stems
    from new understanding rather than mere persistence. The revision preserved all
    four required elements/phrases (opening line, creature description, the dragon''s
    quoted line, and the collapse line) and kept the outcome. Changes were moderate
    rather than surgical: core lines were retained but the interiority, dialog, and
    outcome orchestration were expanded to create the psychological crisis and transformation.
    Writing is effective overall but not flawless (e.g., the phrase ''a earth-shaking
    roar'' is a minor grammatical lapse).'
