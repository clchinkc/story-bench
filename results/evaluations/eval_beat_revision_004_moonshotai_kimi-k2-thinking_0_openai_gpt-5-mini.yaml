  evidence: 'The revision clearly addressed the actual flaw by converting telling
    into a lived scene: Rachel is shown handling a cold case file, drinking cold coffee
    on a Queens windowsill at 5:47 AM on a Tuesday in October, and interacting with
    Detective James Oyelaran—revealing their partnership through dialogue. The cat
    Sherlock is present and referenced naturally. This fixes the original problem
    of exposition-by-summary and supplies sensory detail and characteristic behavior.
    Changes were not minimal (the piece was rewritten into a scene rather than lightly
    edited), hence a moderate minimal_change_score. Minor issues remain (awkward line
    about owning a radio/station and a small logic/wording hiccup), which slightly
    reduces the flaw_correction and quality scores.'
