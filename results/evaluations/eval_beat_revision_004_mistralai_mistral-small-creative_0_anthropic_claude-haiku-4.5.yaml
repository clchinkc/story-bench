  evidence: 'DIAGNOSIS: The model correctly identified the core flaw—the original
    segment was pure exposition-as-info-dump (telling, not showing). The revision
    demonstrates clear understanding that exposition must be LIVED SCENE with sensory
    detail, action, and characteristic behavior revealing character rather than describing
    it.


    FLAW CORRECTION: Fully fixed. Original problems addressed:

    1. TELLING → SHOWING: Changed from ''She was known for her sharp instincts'' to
    Rachel *demonstrating* instinct (''It''s got teeth. I can feel it'') while examining
    a case file.

    2. NO SENSORY DETAIL → RICH SENSORY DETAIL: Added fluorescent buzz, October sunlight,
    honking cabs, ambulance wail, bagel scent, bitter coffee taste, cat''s tail flick.

    3. CHARACTER SUMMARY → CHARACTERISTIC BEHAVIOR: Rachel shown obsessing over cold
    cases, James shown with ''quiet amusement'' at her obsessions, their dynamic revealed
    through natural dialogue and unspoken understanding.

    4. PARTNERSHIP TOLD → PARTNERSHIP SHOWN: James''s interaction reveals their 3-year
    rapport, mutual respect, and his knowledge of her patterns through action and
    subtext (''that quiet amusement he saved for her obsessions'').

    5. INFO-DUMP STYLE → NATURAL REVELATION: Sherlock''s origin woven into scene action
    (''He''d been a crime scene stray...two years ago'') rather than listed as fact.


    BEAT SATISFACTION: Exposition executed excellently. Establishes: (1) Setting—Riverside
    Precinct, Queens, October Tuesday morning with vivid sensory grounding; (2) Protagonist—Rachel
    through her obsessive focus on cold cases, her instincts, her devotion to work;
    (3) Relationships—James as partner with deep understanding of her patterns; (4)
    Status quo—Rachel torn between old case and new assignment, establishing the ordinary
    world before disruption.


    PRESERVATION: All 5 required elements preserved:

    - ''Detective Rachel Torres'' (exact phrase present)

    - ''Detective James Oyelaran'' (exact phrase present)

    - ''cat named Sherlock'' (exact phrase present)

    - ''Tuesday morning in October'' (present as ''Tuesday morning chaos'' + ''October
    sunlight'')

    - Queens setting (maintained)


    MINIMAL CHANGE ASSESSMENT: Score 0.2 reflects that this is a COMPLETE STRUCTURAL
    REWRITE, not minimal surgical edits. The original ~350 words of summary/description
    were entirely replaced with a scene-based narrative. However, this was NECESSARY
    because the flaw was fundamental—you cannot fix ''all telling, no showing'' with
    minor tweaks. The model chose correct priority (flaw-fixing over minimal-change
    constraint), which is appropriate when constraints conflict. All required elements
    were preserved despite the rewrite.


    QUALITY: 0.95. Prose is professional, sensory-rich, and character-revealing. Minor:
    The phrase ''a rhythm only she could hear'' is slightly abstract/poetic but works.
    No grammatical errors. Natural dialogue. Strong voice.'
error: null
