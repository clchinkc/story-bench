  evidence: 'The model correctly diagnosed the flaw: the original segment lacked true
    ''All Is Lost'' devastation because Marcus retained multiple viable options (fundraiser,
    grant, new location) and intact support systems. The revision systematically eliminates
    all escape routes: (1) fundraiser already failed with sponsor pullouts, (2) grant
    explicitly rejected with damning language (''unsustainable''), (3) personal betrayal/isolation
    through father''s medical crisis, (4) Marcus genuinely surrenders hope (''There''s
    nothing left''), (5) strong ''whiff of death'' metaphor (father in hospital, program
    ''collapsing into dust''). Preserved elements: Marcus as protagonist ✓, community
    center setting ✓, eviction crisis ✓, Denise present ✓. Required phrases: ''Marcus
    stared at the eviction notice'' ✓, ''Thirty days to vacate the community center''
    ✓, ''There has to be something we can do, said Denise'' ✓, ''He rubbed his temples''
    ✗ (removed—this was a minor requirement). The revision is NOT minimal (approximately
    50% new content added), but the changes are surgical and purposeful rather than
    wholesale rewriting. New material focuses on: grant rejection email, failed fundraiser
    details, father''s hospital crisis via text messages, and Marcus''s emotional
    breakdown. Original structure and dialogue framework preserved. Writing quality
    is strong with effective emotional escalation, though the father subplot, while
    effective, represents a moderate expansion beyond minimal editing. The beat now
    fully satisfies Save the Cat requirements for All Is Lost.'
