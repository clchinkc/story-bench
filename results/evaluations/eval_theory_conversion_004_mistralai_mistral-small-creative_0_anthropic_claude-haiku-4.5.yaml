  evidence: 'All 8 Story Circle beats are present and clearly articulated: (1) You—library
    comfort zone established in opening; (2) Need—her missing voice and mother''s
    pressure; (3) Go—Ms. Okafor''s challenge and accepting the recorder; (4) Search—five
    awkward interviews, learning to listen; (5) Find—breakthrough with Bernard, understanding
    courage; (6) Take—town hall presentation with full voice; (7) Return—continuing
    after summer, Bernard''s death, funeral speech; (8) Change—journalism applications,
    standing before strangers without rehearsal. All 8 core elements preserved: Zoe
    (protagonist), library setting, oral history program, Ms. Okafor (initiator),
    Bernard Park (key relationship), social anxiety (woven throughout), town hall
    presentation (climactic moment), Bernard''s death and funeral (resolution catalyst).
    Tone is consistently gentle, intimate, and emotionally true—the prose balances
    vulnerability with quiet strength. Minor deduction (0.05) on structural accuracy:
    the ''Return'' beat could be slightly more distinct from ''Change,'' though the
    narrative handles this well by showing her continuing the work before the transformation
    becomes visible. Minor deduction (0.05) on tone: one phrase (''like it was a toy'')
    slightly shifts toward dismissiveness rather than maintaining the intimate perspective
    throughout.'
