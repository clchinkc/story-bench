  evidence: 'What the model addressed: The revision clearly attempted to diagnose
    the All Is Lost problem by deepening Marcus''s emotional despair and isolating
    him from support—Denise''s wavering hope and Marcus''s internal collapse are emphasized.
    Was that correct: Partially. The model correctly targeted the need for a darker,
    more hopeless tone and more isolation. What it failed to do: It did not enact
    the explicit, concrete closures requested by the true fix — the fundraiser is
    not shown to have failed, the grant is not presented as rejected or corrupt, there
    is no personal betrayal or literal loss that severs Marcus''s support, and there
    is no strong ''whiff of death'' (metaphorical or literal) that definitively destroys
    his purpose. How minimal were the changes: Edits were moderate — structure and
    key lines were preserved (all four required phrases present: "Marcus stared at
    the eviction notice in his hands", "Thirty days to vacate the community center",
    "There has to be something we can do," said Denise", and "He rubbed his temples"),
    but new sentences and emotional beats were added to heighten despair rather than
    surgically swapping in the specific required plot defeats. Overall: The rewrite
    improves tone and isolation but only partially fixes the All Is Lost beat; it
    falls short of exhausting Marcus''s options or delivering the definitive loss/betrayal
    needed for a full execution of that beat.'
