  evidence: The model produced a revised version of the original Dark Night of the
    Soul segment (adding lines about the lease sign, hospice smell, the key feeling
    useless, etc.) rather than stating that no revision was needed. The rewrite demonstrates
    an understanding of the beat’s elements (isolation, despair, whiff of death) but
    the model did not acknowledge the segment was already correct and instead made
    unnecessary changes.
