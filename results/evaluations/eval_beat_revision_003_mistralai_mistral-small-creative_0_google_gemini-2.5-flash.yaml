  evidence: 'The model correctly identified that the original segment failed to show
    Sophie''s transformation upon returning. It addressed all five points of the required
    fix: Sophie responds differently to work stress, applies an insight from the retreat
    (the quiet stillness), shows a behavioral marker of change (slipping phone back
    into bag, prioritizing ''being here''), creates contrast by explicitly stating
    her old behavior, and her mother notices the change. The changes were surgical
    and effective, maintaining the original structure while injecting the necessary
    transformation.'
