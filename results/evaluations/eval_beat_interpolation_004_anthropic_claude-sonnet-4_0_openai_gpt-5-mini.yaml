  evidence: 'All four required elements are present: Thomas''s direct examination,
    a clear near-recant (long pause, fear, case slipping away), Thomas takes decisive
    action (personal appeal and promise), and the turning point results in the truth
    being revealed. None of the must-not items occur. Characters behave consistently
    and the scene cleanly bridges rising action to falling action with maintained
    setting continuity; no deductions applied.'
