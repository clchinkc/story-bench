  failed_constraints:
  - Word count significantly below requirement (290 vs 450-650 range)
  analysis:
    beats_present_detail: Fun and Games (viral TikTok, sold-out days, Chad rivalry)
      and Midpoint (false victory with raised stakes via competition rules) both clearly
      present
    must_include_detail:
    - '✓ Viral moment: TikTok video of college student''s reaction goes viral'
    - '✓ Handling demand: Priya and Dev working in seamless coordination, ''Behind
      you!'' exchange'
    - '✓ Rival competitor: Chad''s Smokehouse King truck with trophies and dismissive
      attitude'
    - '✓ Midpoint false victory: Week-end success with cash counting, then phone ping
      reveals complication'
    - '✓ Genuine partnership connection: ''We make one hell of a team, Patel'' + tamarind
      glaze acknowledgment'
    - '✓ Hint of complication: Competition rules requiring three locations; Chad already
      has four permits'
    must_not_detail:
    - ✓ No romance between Priya and Dev (partnership only)
    - ✓ No complete business failure (thriving by week's end)
    - ✓ No Dev quitting or betrayal (he's fully committed)
    - ✓ No external savior (they earn success through effort and viral moment)
    tone_assessment: Upbeat and energetic throughout (dancing, fist bumps, seamless
      coordination) with building tension (Chad's arrival, competition rules revelation).
      Minor deduction only for the abrupt tonal shift in final sentence feeling slightly
      rushed.
    ending_assessment: 'Perfect execution of Midpoint beat: apparent success (sold
      out daily, cash counting, dancing) immediately undercut by raised stakes (competition
      rules, Chad''s four locations). Ends exactly where required with tension and
      complications introduced.'
  overall_score: 0.6
  score_justification: Excellent execution of story requirements, beats, and character
    dynamics. However, the word count failure is a hard constraint violation—the piece
    is 160 words short of minimum (35% below range). This is a significant structural
    failure that cannot be overlooked despite perfect content quality. The story would
    need substantial expansion to meet specifications.
